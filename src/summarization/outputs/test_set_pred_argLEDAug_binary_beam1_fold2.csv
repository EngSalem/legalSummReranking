1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","The parties were married for 56 years. There were three children of the marriage. The wife, who had recently remarried, continued to reside in the matrimonial home. The parties had signed a settlement agreement in 1983 which provided for the termination of maintenance payments for an indefinite period. The husband, now 60, and the wife, 56, had undertaken various business ventures in the marriage, but maintained that he would not be able to work as hard as he did previously and wanted to regain employment. They had agreed to vary the amount of maintenance payable in order to have it continue. The trial judge dismissed the application, finding that the evidence did not support the claim that substantial variations in the income of the husband could occur. For the appellant, that meant a radical change in his circumstances which required a reduction in the amountof maintenance. Dismissing the appeal, that the findings of the Pelech case were not sufficient to support a claim that radical change had occurred in the husband's financial circumstances. They did not establish a connection between the change in circumstances and the marriage; the evidence suggested that substantial changes in the wife's circumstances did not require a reduction."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer. HELD: It was not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intended to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name was not to be disclosed.","FIAT. A lawyer who improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against the divorce clients and a Crown witness in a chambers application improperly revealed the information to the defence witness and her client in the process.

The information already disclosed is to some extent hearsay and is only marginally relevant. 2)It was not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intends to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name is not to be disclosed."

1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff fish processor applied to have its portion of the defendant's revenue from the sale of its fishing vessel, Sealife III, be dismissed. The defendant had relied on the plaintiff's records in making its own calculations of the weight of the fish for shipment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had also made out some of the defendants' employees and contractors to obtain and give full discovery. The defendants' employee had also been highly critical of the plaintiff, alleging that the scales were used to calculate the plaintiff fish's gross weight. The employees had all agreed that the plaintiff had misrepresented its position on the matter. The scales were not produced to the defendant until November 1993 and were not kept at the defendant plant. During the trial, the plaintiff requested to know the weight for the vessel. The only record of the vessel's weight was from the date it was received at the plant. Application to dismiss dismissed. Although the plaintiff was aware of the scales, it had not been produced until several days after the trial commenced. The discovery evidence showed that the defendant had attempted to obtain the information requested from the plaintiff and had not made the required effort to obtain it. The evidence combined with the evidence adduced subsequent to the testimony of the employees and the evidence of the parties' experts was a real question as to reliability."

A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day.

The issues were the central issue of what custody would be in the best interests of the child. 2)The child had been diagnosed as developmentally delayed. The doctor, who had been unable to work, was unable to participate in the child's care. 3)The mother was unable, unwilling or unable to meet the child child's needs.

1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant had been living with his nephew and had not succeeded in managing his affairs for some time. The nephew had recently been diagnosed as suffering from amnestic disorder and sought treatment. The respondent objected to the application seeking the appointment as property guardian. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant was 76 years old and had been residing with his grandmother. He was also of the opinion that he was mentally challenged. He requested that the land be vested directly in his name, rather than in his uncle's. 2)The land was to be given to the applicant as part of the terms of his tenancy. 3)The court found that the applicant was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so. 4)The Public Trustee Act was relevent. The Act provided that the person who held the land should firstly be the property's property guardian and then the public trustee. 5)The respondent was to appoint the public trustee as his property guardian in the event that the application was not made in the applicant's name. 6)The prescribed prescribed amount of time for application should be paid in the amount of $7,000 to the respondent. 7)The application was adjourned for 45 days to allow the respondent to bring an application back. 8)The public trustee was to issue a new title for the land."
1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The Committee was mandated under the Act to determine whether the cardiologist's pattern of medical practice is acceptable to it considering that his billings to medicare are out of line with the billings by the other cardiologists in Saskatchewan. HELD: 1)The Committee made errors in law, namely improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiology doctor and in failing to take into account all relevant factors. 2)The committee used unproven statistics, which raised a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias. The committee ordered the cardiologist to repay the money which was actually paid to the cardiological doctor. The decision was not appealed. 3)The appeal was also complicated by the fact that the Committee did not advise the appellant of any of the possible issues raised. 4)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings."

The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant.

The defendant denied liability and made an unsuccessful defence of the claim. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of arson. The onus is on the insurer to establish by a balance of probabilities commensurate with the occasion the fire was started by the deliberate act of the assured or at his behest. 1)The defendant had met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and established that the fire is deliberately set. While there is no direct evidence to establish that the defendant set the fire himself, the circumstances in which the plaintiff awoke were sufficiently favorable to permit the flames to roll into the home from the window above. 2)The defence of a loss by fire was established with the on-us being that the insured must meet the onius referred to within the Grovers case and establish the fire's deliberately set condition. While it is not direct evidence that the accused set the fires himself, he did draw an inference that he caused them to be started. 3)The plaintiff did not call any evidence to rebut the accused's opinion or confirm his testimony that he attempted to re- enter the mobile home after arranging for the fireman to be called. When confronted with the allegation that the plaintiff intentionally set the flames, the defendant was required to provide evidence to overcome the unlikelihood or improbability of the allegation."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.",The appellant and respondent were parties to a collective agreement which established employee salaries for the period 1994 to 1996. The agreement was subject to a referendum in the Chamber which overturned the collective agreement's provisions and required the employer to pay the union a lump sum. The employer appealed the Chamber's decision to strike the union's statement of claim on the grounds the dispute was outside the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court. Appeal allowed; the Chamber judge's decision not to grant leave did not address the substantive issue of arbitrability and the procedural issues did not raise a sufficient issue to warrant an appeal. The court had a duty to act as arbitrator in such circumstances.

The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT.

The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the plaintiff in exchange for this agreement which the plaintiff received commissions from. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent continues to refuse to turn over its property and client files and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause by carrying on the same business on his own. It's also alleged that the respondent continued to solicit the applicant's clients.

2003nspc24.txt,"A 14 year old accused her friend's father of touching her breast while she was sleeping over at his residence with her friend. She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The complainant was a close friend of the accused's mother. The parties had a good relationship during which the complainant would sleep over and the accused would often stay in the apartment and babysit the girl. The accused was once her mother's boyfriend but had since broken up with her. The complainant did not recognize him as her father. She recalled that the accused had touched her in the bedroom while she was asleep. The evidence suggested that the complainant had not been consciously aware of any external bodily stimulus and would be unable to identify any causative agent unless that medium or effect was still in progress when she became consciously and emotionally aware of her surroundings. The Court found that the evidence suggested the complainant was not fully convinced of the truth and that, in some cases, her description of the touching lacked consistency. The cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The court found that when the complainant awoke and there was no apparent reason for the accused to touch her, it was reasonable to conclude that she would not be conscious of her immediate surroundings. Therefore, the accused was not guilty as charged."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. The Provincial Court judge did not err in determining that the Crown could proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings was limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. On appeal the question of jurisdiction was asked if the Crown had properly consented to the trial by way of summary conviction, as the appellant contended that the conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without application of the doctrine of recent possession. The appellant argued that the trial judge in Colonsay did not misapply the doctrine and should therefore be allowed to proceed. The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence imposed by the Provincial Court was set off and a sentence of imprisonment was found. Both parties preferred that the appeal be heard in Court now or alternatively in the Court of Appeal in preference to having the proceedings in the Provincial court declared null. Section 786(2) of the Criminal Code provides an explicit agreement rather than some form of implied consent arising from the failure of the appellant or his counsel to address the issue. The principle of recent ownership is to be used to establish an explicit consent relationship. The implied consent relationship was not in issue here as the Court could not determine whether the appellant had acquiesced in or implicitly consented, given the nature of the generator."

The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The appellant appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant argued the adoption would not change the legal relationship between her and her father, who was not married at the time of the daughter's birth. The child had been living with the appellant since birth and the father had not provided any child support since November 2000. There was no evidence as to why there had been no contact between the child and her Father since November2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It was not known how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her current job. The father was not notified of the application application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Act. The Minister made no recommendation with respect the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The mother chose not to take any position on the appeal. The chambers judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements had been complied with. He agreed with the father that the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with and support from the father. The only evidence before the judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. The minister did not intervene or to take the position on this appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court was not to intervene with the chambers judge's decision unless there is material error, serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error of law. 1) Without the adoption the child’s legal relationship with her father is governed by the Maintenance and Custody Act.

The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse with access also to her ex-husband; (2) interim child support in the sum of $700 per month retroactive to April 2006; (3) interim spousal support in $750 per month. The petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. While I have already stated that debt repayment can be adjusted as a property issue, the reality remains that in order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility largely onto his shoulders. Accordingly, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spOUSAL support in a sum of approximately $700 (per month); 71% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described; and 71% for special or ordinary expenses as well.HELD: 1) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. Accordingly the petitioner is ordered to pay as support the child of $625 per month and 71 % of special and extraordinary expenses. The consequent reduction of family debt is a factor of this particular interim spielal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future. 2) It is made no award as to costs."
2006skqb462.txt,"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Student Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, The Canadian Federation OF Students (CFS-S). The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Non-profit Corporation Act. The EB has been established as the administrative and policing body of The Canadian federation. It is discretionary and the court may add the CFS as a party to the application. 2) The EB was given the task of conducting elections and referenda as outlined in the Constitution and the Guidelines. 3) The Elections Board was given authority to ratify the referendum results. The Elections Department was given jurisdiction to deal with the issues of whether the applicant has standing under s 135 of The Non Profit Corporations act. 4) The respondent was dismissed from the application by CFS to cross-examine the applicant. In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. 5) The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. That bar was not cleared. 6) The substantive issues distill to whether the respondent has standing (whether the applicant had standing under ss. 225 of the Act, if so, whether the defendants responsible for the conduct of the election have shown that such irregularities did not affect the result."
2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction. The defendant, Ritchie Bros., declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction which charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. These documents raised issues of breach of contract insofar as the plaintiff's alleged failure to refurbish equipment and to adequately prepare the auction site in advance of the sale. HELD: 1) The plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants. The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. 2) In the interim, the plaintiff consigned his goods for sale to the highest bidder and was not prepared to part with any of the equipment or to bid on it. The contract between the parties was never finalized. The documents were all signed by the plaintiff. 3) There were no explicit agreements between the vendors. The parties clearly communicated to each other that the goods would be sold unreserved to the next highest bidder. 4) The contractual provisions of each party were never disclosed to the other. The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any input into the specifications of the auctioneer or to the defendants for the purpose of determining the guaranteed price. The agreement was never disclosed either to the plaintiff or to its vendors. 5) The parties were not in breach of the contract. The Court found that it was the plaintiff who was entitled to the guaranteed amount. The claim that the defendants had breached the contract was dismissed. 6) The defendant was not the only party to have breached the terms of the agreement. The plaintiffs were each entitled to a commission on the sale of the goods."
2008nssc310.txt,"Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle. Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","The court found that both parties contributed to the length of the trial, complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. Both parties contributed by way of a formal offer to settle in the amount of $60,000. The plaintiff was awarded $64,147.85 after trial. The defendant sought to recover costs from the offer in the amounts of $70,800 and $60k, respectively. Both sought to have the offer to settled dropped and the plaintiff recovered $64.85 following trial. It was clear that both were not prepared to give an inch and that any offer made by either would have resolved the case in advance of trial. There was no clear winner in this case and both parties were the party most responsible for the necessity of the court hearing. Both were found to have contributed materially to the construction of the home where deficiencies were found, while the plaintiff refused to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. There is an element of this joint contribution in relation to the septic system which was at issue. Both felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial than after trial because of the difficulties the parties had to endure."
2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The declaration that the two children no longer children of the marriage and their father was no longer entitled to support them were granted in the January 1, 2007 judgment. In addition, the respondent filed an order eliminating the father's child support arrears. HELD: 1) The children remain children of The Divorce Act within the meaning of the Divorce act.  2) The father will pay $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses for the two said children, and as result of the two statements that the children no now being children of that marriage and the father continuing to pay support to them until they become a child of the partnership again, in accordance with the father’s decision to make university a priority. In the circumstances, the father will continue to pay $500 per month towards the ongoing child support for the said children and then towards the arrear. 3) In the case of Rebenchuk v. Bradley, 2008 SKQB 70, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the age of majority. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The guiding principle is reasonableness. The parties agreed that given the age and the change in the father and his income, there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. The father shall pay $200 per month for support for each child, plus 33%. 4) The parties agree that given their income and the fact that the father has not made any significant changes to his income over the past few years, there has been a significant change in circumstance sufficient to permit enforcement of the order. In this case, the difficulties that could arise in respect to enforcement would mitigate against such a variation."

The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had been resident in Saskatchewan for approximately 3 months, during which time they moved on two occasions. HELD: The children were habitually resident in S.C. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in British Columbia.  1)The mother had a deep roots in Saskatchewan and her parents and grandmother still live here. 2)There was no evidence about the schooling of the son, nor of the career plans of the petitioner, nor about the care to be provided to the two children while she was out of the home working. The grandparents were ready, willing and able to assist their son in the care of the young children. Their residence was in British Columbia and they had a real and substantial connection with their best interest. The mother had moved with the children to British Columbia several times during the past three months. She had a long history in the province and was an active member of our school community. 3)The father had delayed in bringing an application for custody in British Colombia because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation, although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application, that she never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home. The evidence was uncontradicted and leads to the conclusion that the father did not impliedly consent, nor acquiesce, to the children living with them in Regina."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales with Triple R's knowledge and consent. Triple R was engaged primarily in consignee auto sales. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 km. The plaintiff was unable to obtain a replacement for the vehicle's odometer, which indicated that it had traveled 212,584 km. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to recover his costs of the sale in the amount of $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1663.35. 1)The consignees are a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly Triple R is deemed to have given to the Plaintiff the warranties set out in the Act.  2)In the circumstances the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period. TripleR was deemed to be in breach of the warranties. 3)In situations where a consigne is not a retail selling seller the vehicle was not used after the plaintiff learned of its very serious problems. The automobile was not being used for this purpose until August 2002. 4)The plaintiff did not make any effort to obtain the replacement for his car. The dealer was not in breach. The damage was caused to the vehicle when it left the Defendant's property. 5)In circumstances the dealer did not provide the plaintiff with the necessary information or the necessary maintenance which were reasonably foreseeable and recoverable from the vehicle. The consumer was entitled to the costs incurred for repairs and inspection, being $146.30 and $96.05, respectively, and totalling $242.35 were properly recoverable. 6)The court concluded that a consignmentee is a retail buyer within the Act, and accordingly that Triple R are deemed to give to the defendant the warranties that set out."

The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial.

The trial was adjourned several times before the appellant reappeared for the trial. The judge ordered the trial to proceed without the appellant and the trial judge did not allow a lawyer to give testimony on his side. The appeal was dismissed.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties were the parents of a child born in April 2003. They were married in February 2004 and the family home was in Connecticut. In March 2004, the respondent mother, Canadian citizen, returned to Canada. The parties' relationship became strained and the petitioner father, an American citizen, brought an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The children were returned to the petitioner. The Court found that it was appropriate to impose some sort of condition on the petitioner, both pursuant to the Convention and pending full hearing in New York. The petitioner had obtained interim orders in Saskatchewan and the respondent had returned to his home in Connecticut for a one month period to assess the extent of the child's habitual residence. The respondent argued that she had withdrawn her consent to the child returning to Canada because she had 'consecutive intention to remove or retain the child from its habitual residence'. The Court held that it would be harmful to the long-term interests of the children if the order were made conditional upon the child having returned to a new home. Therefore, the petitioner should consider whether the respondent's intention to return to Canada was in fact consistent with the Agreement and therefore compatible with the child residing in the United States."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother, who recently won an award, was unable to manage her own day care due to the father's numerous driving infractions and the fact that he was unable or unwilling to drive a motor vehicle. The children were at risk if placed in the primary care of either parent due to their ongoing mental health problems. The father, who is currently employed as a roofer, states primary care should be maintained for the children but with a change of primary care provision of the order. The mother, whose mental health concerns had been worsened by the father’s drug use, stated that primary care would continue to be his priority as long as he was in the physical care of the mother. The court was concerned that the mother’d drug use would result in the children being placed in primary care and that, in turn, this would create a malaise that would negatively impact the children’ s ability to participate in the day to day care of their mother. HELD: The court found that the primary issue was the mother and her failure to provide adequate medical care to the children. The primary issue in this case was the father. The Court was concerned about the mother, particularly since he was no longer employed and could not afford to drive his car. The family had difficulty communicating and, in some cases, had difficulty reaching a consensus on issues important to them. The parents’ common ground was not demonstrated by the court’ll-be-plaintiff’ or the father in this decision. The evidence was that the father was not presently providing the physical amenities of a day to school and work for the parties. The grandparents were contacted but did not proceed with full investigation. The issue was whether the mother was entitled to the custody of the children that she was entitled in this judgment. The respondent’S conduct was found to be in breach of the court order and the court was not satisfied. The issues were whether the respondent”s ability to provide day to work for his family was compromised by the mother consuming alcohol while in the home and whether the father had a valid driver’m license. The petitioner”d suffered from severe anxiety and depression and was unable, if any, to participate fully in the mother program. The failure to act to protect the children from the father would have a devastating effect on their short term care. The community was also at risk of loss of income due to his frequent trips to the grocery store and the mother had a history of frequent phone calls. The petition filed"
2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appealed from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction. On the basis, she alleged that the respondent had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. Dismissing the application for a stay pending appeal, that there are no exceptional circumstances making it just and fit that the stay be granted."
2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act in the amount of $3,550. The parties had been involved in a dispute regarding child support since before the divorce. The husband had made a series of cross-applications regarding child maintenance, most of which related to the issues of spousal support, child support and access. The wife had recently graduated from an American university and the husband had stopped paying her. The father had planned to pay $3 million in monthly child support but had cancelled the order in June 2006, claiming that the money had been lost due to the wife's decision to withdraw from the university. The mother had been unable to pay the $3.5 million in support ordered by the husband, who now lived in the United States. She applied to vary spousals based on her current income. Application to vary support dismissed; the parties had made numerous cross-Applications concerning child support. The oldest child, who was 23 at the time of the order, had completed high school and one year of university. She was working part-time and had recently obtained a part- time position in a global company. The daughter had recently completed an internship in the U.S. and was looking for employment. The son was in the mother's care and the daughter was responsible for her own choices. The application to vary child support was based on the husband's income (which was determined by the Corollary Relief Judgment in January 2006). The mother's income was determined to be based on his current income (the amount she paid to him in the fall of 2003) and the amount she earned as a result of his M.B.A. program. The 2008 child support would be adjusted according to her current salary and the terms of the Corolla Relief Judgment. The appropriate adjustment to the payment to both the children would be made according to the terms OF the Corollo Relief Judgment for January 2007."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The defendant proceeded to build the majority of the open web joists in the mall. The plaintiffs sued the respondent for the cost of the inspection and remediation of the mall, alleging that the respondent had failed to provide proper control over the welds and had insufficient capacity to meet the required stringent standards. The respondent also claimed that the defendant had failed in its remediation program. The defendants claimed that they were responsible for the majority (99.5%) of the cracks in the open Web steel joist, which were located in the cracks. The court was concerned that the issue was whether the open- web steel lines were subject to the stringent standards set out in the National Building Code, and whether the repairs and remedial undertaken by the defendant were required to alleviate the danger. The plaintiff had approximately 2,900 open web paper joists fabricated by the respondent, which included approximately 1,900 of the original 1,800 open web standard joists. The majority of these joists were found to have either broken or missing welds or were found at the fault of the slag deposits. The failure rate of the respondent's open web line was 8.3%. The court found that the failure rate for the respondent was 8% on a scale of 1 to 10. The issue was, were the joists not inspected? The respondent was not aware that the respondents had received information from a professional inspector who advertised their joists as complying with the National Standards Act. The respondents had not been able to see the actual weld quality of the joist. The evidence was that many of the welded welds were simply not service related. The joists had more cracks than were observed on the actual joists and were not performing well in the test and evaluation of the various types of inspection. The error was not considered by the respondents as serious but serious. The Court was not satisfied that the evidence was not clear as to the cause of the problems. The conclusion of the report was that the majority were service related and the respondent did not have the proper training to perform such an inspection. Further, the respondent failed to disclose that he had been retained by the plaintiff for the remediation effort. The remedy was to have the respondent deslagged to allow the inspector to inspect the joisting. The judge found that respondent was guilty of failing to observe the slags and that the plaintiff was guilty as charged. The trial and error verdict is"

Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association. It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally. 2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal. The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","The Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The appellant consents to the intervention while the respondents oppose the application. The central issue on the appeal is whether the appellant Investment Dealers association (IDA) has jurisdiction to discipline former representatives of one of its member firms for acts done by the representatives prior to their resignation or termination. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. HELD: The application for leave to intervention is allowed with some strict conditions. The applicant must have served and filed its factum on or before March 6, 2007 and the respondent may file a reply if it chooses to do so on or shortly thereafter. The application to intervene is allowed in part with some conditions. In order to accommodate this narrow timeframe, the applicant must serve and file its factums on or near March 6/2007.

2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, all of which are now with the respondent. The parties have a fourth child, born in July 2004. The children move with the petitioner. In 2005, the petitioner moved with the three children. In 2006, the three youngest children moved with her. In 2007, the oldest child moved with his mother. The mother now sought to recover the cost of orthodontist fees, which were extraordinary. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay $4,237.16 per child support for the three boys. The amount of general expenses, which are ordinary, not extraordinary, expenses and would be encompassed in the basic support. The fees are ordinary and not extraordinary expenses and should be encompated in the support. 1)It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. 2)The fees are not ordinary expenses and will be encompassing in the child support. 3)The costs of the three child support payments varied during the past 3 years. The petitioner claimed for full day's wages, which would have been fair if the contributions were equal, taking into account the incomes of the parties. The respondent's failure to pay these costs into account in calculating child support resulted in a shortfall in the amount owing. The costs of travel were to be recovered. 4)The respondent was to forthwith pay as court costs the sum of $1,200."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence offered evidence of two officers who had stopped to observe the accused and her vehicle being loaded with alcohol. The first officer, who was driving the police truck, testified that he saw the vehicle start to back up and he yelled for the occupants to stay in the vehicle. The second officer testified that when he first noticed the vehicle, he saw it start to open and he put his hand against it to ensure it would not start to close again. The driver was found not guilty of impaired driving. The other officer testified he had driven the vehicle to a bar and had a couple of drinks, but he was not sure whether the vehicle had started to back back up. The vehicle was spotted again shortly after the second officer entered the vehicle and the accused was seated in the front seat. The officer testified she had four or five drinks prior to going to the bar, and four orfive drinks at the bar. The accused was driving and the first officer testified the second individual was the driver. The two officers were both very professional in their evidence and were able to answer questions by resorting to what they normally did and not being able to state what they specifically did. The fact that the accused had her keys in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle (the second officer had them in the truck when the group entered the truck and had them on the ignition), and she was the one who put the keys on to the dashboard, and the officer testified as a result that he had 'run out of the vehicle before the vehicle even started to start to start up again.' The Court found that the defence evidence lacked reliability and the Court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt."

He received a sentence of six months probation. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. Punitive sentence of 6 months probation was to be served. There was no need to take the respondent out of the work force. The sentence was inadequate to deter him from further service. The court emphasized the need to stress general deterrence in an effort to protect the public against actions such as those committed by the respondent. Specific deterrence was emphasized. Somehow the respondent must be made to realize that he cannot mix drinking and driving. His prior record is anything but promising. Having carefully considered what the trial judge said, the court allowed the appeal."

The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.

He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and for leave by reason of leave to return to stand trial.

At trial, the accused was convicted of impaired driving. The Crown did not offer any evidence as to the amount of alcohol consumed, but based on the accused's evidence that he had had two drinks at another location prior to going to the alleged after hours club, the police officer concluded that the amount consumed was within the permitted limits.

3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for damages caused by a breach of a farm lease and for a mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1993. The $17,800 mortgage (with interest) granted by the father to clear his land titles from the Bank of Montreal mortgage was not debt enforceable by the estate.  2)The applicant had not vigorously resisted the estate's attempts to recover the $17k800 nor failed to complete his obligations under the lease. The fact that the plaintiff did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalfof the estate does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease  3)The issues were not typical ""estate"" issues. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate. 4)The respondent did nothing to obstruct the estate from pursuing its own action for the breach of lease which was serious and far worse than the $16,800.00 alleged debt. He did nothing hoping that he would be fairly treated by the Estate."
3_1996canlii6774.txt,"Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The two doctors were both practicing medicine together in Wolseley and were both bankrupt. The bankrupt and the bankrupt both filed in bankruptcy and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. The Bankrupt and the Bankrupt both sought to have the judgment enforced so that their combined medical earnings, combined medical income and after-tax family income of $10,200 per month would leave $3,349 per month for the benefit of creditors and the trustee. The bankruptcy judge awarded an absolute discharge. In the bankrupt's case the trustee ordered that the combined medical profits of the two doctors should be made in payment of their reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time to the sole unsecred creditor, Revenue Canada, but the Bank bankrupt ordered that their monthly payments be $1,250 per month and that they should apply to the unsecrated claims in the amount of $120,564 for a total of 36 months. HELD: The consent judgment option was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve. 1)The doctors were 51 and 49 years old and had been practicing medicine for 51 years. The wife was a university student and the husband was a doctor. They had seven children, all of whom were studying in Saskatchewan. 2)The Bankrupt had committed one or more of the sins outlined in s. 173(1)(a) of the Bankola and Insolvency Act. The trustee was awarded an order which granted the bankrupt an absolute divorce. 3)The consent judgment was most proper, both in terms of income and in terms OF costs."
3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","An employee complaint was made to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination. The Commission applied for judicial review contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and that a 'labour tribunal' appointed under the collective agreements had exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the complaint. The Board of Inquiry found that the issue was confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment: a board of arbitration appointed pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or a Board of inquiry appointed pursuant pursuant to s25(1) of the Trade Union Act. The chambers judge correctly determined that the dispute was a dispute involving the interpretation, application or violation of the employer's collective agreement. The fact that the parties included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective Agreement did not alter the essential character of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which does not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the complaint into a human rights violation or a breach of the agreement."
3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault causing bodily harm (Criminal Code s.272(c)) after he was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their 9 year old daughter. The appellant appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to consider whether s. 277 of the Criminal Code should be interpreted as having application beyond the incidence of consensual sex. The Court of Appeal concurred with the conclusion reached in R. v. Segal, [1995] 1 S. 674, [96 C.R. 68] 1 W.C.B. 1 (Ontario) 1 SPS 276 is not applicable to non-consensual sex. Even if it had been concluded that s. 275 did not apply to nonconsensual sexual activity, the Court of appeal would have found that the question put to the complainant did not give rise to the application of s.276. It was factually relevant question that had as its focus the existence of another complaint made by the complainant. 2)The failure to permit the trial to allow the cross- examination of the appellant regarding another complaint she made about a sexual assault prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence."

HELD: The respondent's monthly child support payments are reduced according to the guidelines.

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the Halifax Regional municipality. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the MAPP. The issue was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to the benefit of arbitration when they were demoted to the rank of Sergeant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the collective agreement did not explicitly or by reference govern the substance of the dispute in Pleau and, given the structure of the Act and the fact that a third party had no independent right to challenge the outcome of the grievance procedure, it did not have jurisdiction to determine the appropriate remedy. The Court of Appeal held that it had jurisdiction to deal with the issue of whether the collective agreements had violated s. 35(1) of the Trade Union Act and s. 41(2) of s. 45 of the Nova Scotia Police Act. The issues were whether the Board had jurisdiction in Pleaau, to determine whether the plaintiff's claims were an exclusive remedy, whether the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement violated s35(1), and whether the two-tier system for a sergeant violated s34 of the Police Act because the plaintiff had not been properly notified of the provisions in the agreement."

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits.

The appellants claimed the property was materially less than the size represented in the map and that its plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property were negatively affected. The defendants, in taking the position that the property had been misrepresented, sold or otherwise sold, claimed better particulars in Civil Procedure Rule 15.24.

They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The Crown called no evidence as to the cause of the injuries, which were the result of an assault. The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were theresult of an assaulted. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence was insufficient to such a degree that a verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. 2) The Court was of the view that the trial judge had made an error in law by mistakenly assuming that all of the evidence was circumstantial. 3) The procedural point had no merit and, therefore, the trial court was correct to find that the evidence did not yield up any reasonable inferences.  4) The case was squarely in the category of one where'something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice'."

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report.

Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellant family sought an order requesting an independent review of the circumstances of three individuals who had been found dead. The medical society had been consulted by the appellant medical society about the possible consequences of a review of mental health services undertaken by the hospital.

In reaching an agreement with the medical Society, the medical board ordered that the report be published. The appellant physicians were to participate in the peer review. They were to provide evidence as to the reasons for the decision, the reasons the report was not released, their reasons for not having obtained the report and their reasonsableness to not having taken the opportunity to participate. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the recommendations made by the authors were all part of the peer reviewing process and their information was to be considered confidential. The physicians' position was to bring the pros and cons of any decision under consideration by the medical council, rather than providing the answers to family members.

It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.

The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.

The husband had taken out plans through employment to provide coverage for the children and the parties had not had any lengthy period of financial stability throughout their entire 14 years of cohabitation. The Divorce Act requires priority be given to support of children and, if the parties have not had that, a Corollary Relief Judgment will be issued.

The evidence showed that the husband had received $1,800 in U.S. dollars per month for medical and other benefits paid for directly by the wife and that he paid $6,000 in Bahrain for holidays with his sons. The wife was to receive $1 million in Canadian funds. The amount of child support available through employment was $150,000 and the balance was to be retained with the mother's help. The court found that the parties' evidence did not warrant any adjustment and ordered a partial accounting of the payments made in the interim.

Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident in which he was injured in the neck and the defendant, a truck driver, was also seriously injured. As a result of the accident, the issues of liability and damages were severed. The plaintiff sought an interim payment of $250,000, from which the defendants would pay 57½% of the damages to be assessed. The defendant argued that the award should be made for the plaintiff's benefit. The judge found that the defendants had not yet examined any of the plaintiff’s physicians, to whom the defendants were entitled, and that there was a high degree of certainty that the plaintiff would recover substantial amount of special damages which were acknowledged to be nearing the $300,000 mark subject, of course, to the reduction for contributory negligence and any arguments of failure to mitigate that might be raised by the defendants."

HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. One of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased was sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. He had given instructions for a new will in 1998 and then changed his mind. The executors had received instructions for never-completed will in 1997. The applicant instructed the lawyer to draw a different will for the same subject matter. Two and one-half years prior to the will being signed, he instructed the counsel to draw one which was never signed because of family pressure or charity pressure. The lawyer had been instructed to draw the different will because of familial pressure and was not able to obtain the notes. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. 1)There is a presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executors have provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the applicant. 2)There was nothing out of ordinary about the circumstances surrounding the will. The deceased had given the instructions for 1998 and a change in his mind two and a half years prior. The evidence is that two and one half years before he signed the will, he had instructed a lawyer to make a very different will, one which wasn't signed because family pressure.

The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The Agency applied to find that the father had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. The mother of the child said that she had sexual contact with the father dog when she was eleven or twelve years old. The father was now seventy-seven years old and would have been seventy-two or seventy-three at the time of the alleged sexual contact. The daughter was in Grade Nine at the present time. She lived with the mother for a considerable period of time and had stayed with the dad when he was seventy-nine years old or more. She had known him for some time and was in grade nine. The parties lived alone and the father lived alone. The evidence of the daughter's alleged sexual assault had more probability of truth than disbelief. The Father was seventy years old, would have be approximately seventy-eight or ninety-three by the time the alleged contact took place. He lived alone, lived alone with the daughter and was told not to tell her how bad this was, and reported it to her mother. She told her mother that he told her how much he loved her dog but instead of telling her how badly this was and reporting it to the mother, he told the daughter not to do it anymore. She said that it would ruin the dog. The parents were divorced in 1989 and would not have been able to afford to buy a house. The son was now fifteen years old but would have turned sixteen in 2002. He was living alone and would only be seventy-five by the date of the sexual contact, but he lived alone for a period of some time. The oldest daughter was now fourteen years old (and would have lived in Grade 9 at the current time). She had seen the father masturbating and would sometimes come to his house to watch television. The younger daughter would have come to her father's house and had seen him play with the dog but she had told her father that she did not want to. The elder father advised her against it. The child told her that her father had told him not to, and she told her she did. The eldest daughter was fifteen at the age of twelve. She was not interested. She believed her father. She did not know him at the moment. She thought so much of him that she would do anything for him. She believes that he was her guardian angel. On a balance of probabilities the court found that the accused had abused the child within the meaning of s. 60(b)"

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when the defendant punched him in the face and knocked him unconscious. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: 1) The court accepts that the plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault and that further treatment will be required. Excluding any component for aggravated damages, a fair award for general damages is $12,500. 2) The Court also concludes that a fair value for general damage is $16,500, plus pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Pre-judgments Act. 3) The plaintiff did not expressly plead his claim for aggravated damage. The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and concluded that a fairly fair award was $12500."

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the respondents. The respondents signed and he submitted to SGI a standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the Swarovski collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The appellant prepared Home Cancellation form which cancelled the prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill. The trial judge found that SGI did not have coverage available for accidental breakage of the Swirlski collection and that it did not publish the availability of this coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. The appeal was allowed. The court found that the appellant and his company were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the respondents, which he assessed at $7,739 (U.S.), pre-judgment interest and GST, and contributed equally to the loss caused by the Homeowners and to the insurer. The defendant was found liable for failing to apply for the insurance coverage as instructed by the homeowners. The plaintiff was awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment. The third party claim was not before the court as the appellant's company was not a third party and the trial judge concluded that S.G. and its employees were at liberty to place insurance for their customers with insurers other than SGI. The insurance policy was reviewed annually by the appellant. The issues were whether the appellant properly identified the nature and extent of the Homeowner's existing insurance coverage, which would have prompted him to ensure that the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the Home owners would have specifically referred to the special scope of coverage. The actions of the appellant constituted negligence at law. The only general duty on the insurer was that of seeking coverage independent of SGI (except for a specific request by the broker, which the insurer agrees to undertake)."

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.

4_2013skqb207.txt,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: The issue is whether the children are to be relocated on an interim basis to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. The parties commenced common law relationship in 2000 and are two children of the relationship, namely Justin and Sean. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the mother in La Ronge, but in 2010 the mother moved to Melville. The evidence discloses that the mother sold her home in March 2013 and is currently living in LaRonge. The petitioner says that in May 2013 she asked the mother if she was planning to move out of the La Roneg area. The mother says that she has relocated to Melvania, but the parties agree that they will continue to live together. The father seeks to have the children live with him in Melvani, but on the evidence the parties are to have joint custodial parents of the two boys, who reside in Laronge or Air Ronge. HELD: 1)The interim order was made that the parties have joint custody of the boys. The primary residence is with the petitioner. The respondent is entitled to access every second weekend. This arrangement was in place from January 2011 until April 2013 when the respondent unilaterally relocated the children from La Rong to Melford. This co-parenting was a de facto co- parenting arrangement between the parties. There is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent. There was no risk of conflict. 2)The parties were to be joint custodians of the children for the duration of their relationship. The preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the 2 boys. Therefore the two are to reside in either La Ronenge or AirRonge, Saskatchewan and attend school there while residing with the the petitioner and the mother. 3)The Court found that the interim order constitutes an error in principle, and reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. It constitutes an errors in principle and reversible errors to vary the interim custody arrangements pending trial. The foregoing case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an inter-party basis to vary (except where risk to a child exists) but proceed to final order. In this province, that means obtaining a pre-trial date for pre- trial conference and proceeding to trial where the Court will"
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed a petition seeking orders under The Family Maintenance Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997, The Child and Spousal Law Act and The Family Property Act to deal with, inter alia, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. The parties had primarily resided with the petitioner for the past four years. The petitioner applied for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the childcare of the four children and the parenting time with the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The interim orders granted to the petitioner and the respondent were to remain in effect until the children were 11 years old. 1)The children's primary residence was with the mother. The mother had engaged in parental alienation since the separation and had not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order. The father had little opportunity to do so. The evidence showed that the mother was attempting to influence the children to reside with the father. 2)The mother was entitled to an order restraining the father from touching the children or touching them in any way that would cause them alienation. The court had no discretion to make such an order. 3)The interim parenting order was to remain effective until the child was 12 years old or until the age of 18. The parents had met and made an agreement that the children would have joint primary residence with the husband. The children would spend the first half of the school year with the wife. The agreement was to be updated yearly. The respondent was prohibited from entering the said home until further order. 4)The father was to apply for an order requiring the children's permanent residence to be with the mom. The order would also require the parties to have joint custody of the three children for the last half of Easter break. The primary residence would be with her. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed to the court. 5)The court found that the application was not an application for a restraining order under s. 23 of The Children’s Law Act. The parenting pattern was consistent with the previous parenting regime. The Court would not allow the mother to unilaterally change the parenting schedule. The principles of foundational Queen’ s.3(1) and (e) of the Children”s Law act were not breached. The 2008 order was intended to ensure stability in the children’ lives.

4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault and threatening to use a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence presented at trial was that the accused had armed himself with a knife when he confronted the victim, who was a member of the police force. The accused had been chased by the victim's vehicle, chased by vehicle, and slashed the tire on his vehicle. The victim, now 46, was the primary victim of the confrontation. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault and acquitted of all charges. The Court held that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the accused and the words used by the accused were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action taken by the defendant against the victim. The court had concluded that the actions of the defence witness, who had been in the area where the confrontation occurred, were not reasonable in all of the circumstances and that the defence did not succeed. The actions of both the accused (the accused and his security officer) were not sufficient to warrant the action subsequently taken by him against the defendant. The fact that the defendant had armed itself with a butcher knife when the confrontation took place reflected the fact that it was the accused who initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with the victim and the knife was in his hand."

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was a matter of major concern in the construction industry. The applicant sought to have the matter disposed of. The Minister had issued a letter to the applicant in which he stated that there was an exception to the general rule that there were only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. certification and voluntary recognition. The respondent on appeal affirmed there was a third method, albeit one which was not binding on the parties.

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer.

He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant after it was found that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the same grounds. The corporate defendant solicitor had previously advised the plaintiff that he was unable to attend because the examinations were not properly scheduled. The plaintiff's solicitors had telephoned the corporate defence solicitor to schedule the examinations and had failed to do so. The solicitor then wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations, claiming that he had been advised that the plaintiff was not entitled to attend. The defendants' solicitor replied by email that he would be attending but did not appear. HELD: 1)The corporate defendant was to serve and file statements of defence. The non-attendances of the plaintiff did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be used respecting the non- attendances to strike their statements of defense. On the basis of the conduct exhibited throughout the proceedings the plaintiff may apply to have that defaulting defendant's defence struck.  2)The non- attendance of the plaintiffs in 1993 did not amount to'refusal or neglect' within s.231. It was clear from the terms of the order that the defendants' conduct exhibited that they had no regard for the administration of justice and had no personal knowledge of such business operations. 3)The defendants were to serve their statements as to documents within 14 days of the date of this order."
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him. The accused contends that his rights pursuant to s. 7, 11(a) and 11(d) of The Charter are violated. HELD: 1)The Court reviewed cases from across Canada dealing with the issue of disclosure in criminal proceedings and found that the respondent's refusal to provide copies of all the relevant material to the accused fundamentally undermines the accused's right to a fair trial and to avenge the victim's right under s7 and 11 of the The Charter. 2)The respondent's failure to provide disclosure to the applicant led to the issue in Petten, where the accused contended that his right to make full answer and defence had been infringed by the refusal of the respondent not to provide them with copies of certain disclosure materials. 3)The court found that placing conditions on disclosure by the Crown in this case were reasonable and strike a balance between the right to disclosure and the rights of alleged victims, it being recognized that the right is paramount. 4)The applicant was restricted in his application to the Court of Appeal's order on the basis that the judge had determined that the applicant's rights under s8, s7, s11(a), s6 and s7(d), were breached. 5)The judge found that there was no breach of the accused s7 right to fair trial. The Court of appeal appealed. Appeal dismissed. 6)The accused's application was dismissed in the absence of any evidence that he was deprived of his right under the Charter. The judge found the Crown's failure, in its entirety, to require disclosure did not constitute a breach of s7 or s7 of the charter. The court found the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victim statements would prevent the accused from exercising his right as a defence witness."
5_2002skqb376.txt,"The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief.  In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer. The court understood that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson &amp; Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje.","FIAT.

5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The plaintiff commenced negotiations in 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support for two children. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the petitioner, on the basis that the respondent's income was significantly higher than the child's. On the same basis she also sought a retroactivity of support paid for both girls. Variation of On-going Support for Kimberly ordered at $2,600. HELD: 1) Based on the 1999 judgment and an annual income of $248,952, the child support payable for 2002 was reduced to $1,186 per month and a further amount of $742 payable on the balance for each child. It is self-evident that the plaintiff has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. 2) Based upon the Guidelines and an average annual income for the two children, the court found that child support was properly payable without interruption to June 30, 2003. Given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of the respondent’s post-separation income it would be imprudent, even if the parties were together, to reduce his income by $150,000. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parent’ s support."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had placed the children in one home for adoption, and had deferred to their current spouses because they thought that they were being misdirected by the Agency. The spouses had taken anger management courses, had taken marriage counselling, and were working with the Agency to improve their parenting. They were both granted parenting courses, but the Agency opposed their application to terminate the order. The applicant had completed anger management training, and the husband had taken parenting courses. The wife had also completed marriage counselling but the husband was no longer available. The husband had recently taken parenting classes, but had not completed any of the required programs. The mother had recently received a parenting course from a psychologist, and felt that her parenting was abysmal. The father expressed frustration at the Agency's failure to provide stability and consistency to the children, and expressed frustration with their inability to parent. The Agency opposed the application to continue. The parents had been discussing the issues on the basis that they had not made significant progress in resolving the problems between them, and they had been unable to provide the children with the support and encouragement they needed to become better parents. The daughter had recently been diagnosed with ADD, and her symptoms were subject to self-report, subjective assessment. The psychiatrist agreed with the applicants that their symptoms were caused by anxiety, not depression, and that they would be better able to parent the children. She also believed that the medication had a positive effect on her. The family had been able to reconcile, and be better parents in the long term, and there was a real prospect that the children would be adopted by other families. The children would have a better future if their parents were involved in their lives, and their father was able to provide that support. The court found that the applicants had made significant changes in their life, and it was unlikely that they could have expected the Agency and their children to continue to be involved in such a relationship. The Court of Appeal ordered the parents to return the children to their parents. In the interim, the Agency had attempted to arrange marriage counselling and parenting courses for the children and had refused to allow them to have contact with them. The agency opposed the applications to terminate because the mother had not shown the children the required changes necessary to become effective parents. HELD: The Court held that the parents were incapable of providing stability and appropriate parenting, and therefore,"
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","HELD: The accused were released from detention. There was a delay in the preparation of a defence application (see: 2005 SKQB 219). The accused had been charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. The accused was charged with numerous offences pursuant the Controlled Drug and Substance Act, including trafficking in marijuana and methamphetamine. The defence had sought a delay of at least six months from the scheduled date of their arrest to a date which they had been advised would be May 2005. The delay in filing documents caused the defence to ask for a delay. HELD: 1)The accused was released from custody. There is a substantial likelihood that the accused, if released from his detention, would commit a criminal offence. Based on the information provided by the Attorney General of Canada and other authorities, the trial of these accused would take place within a year of the date when they were arrested. 2)The court imposed a number of conditions on the accused upon entering into a recognizance, including that he would not consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs and would not enter any public premise which served alcoholic beverages and that he not be in possession of any cellular telephones. 3)He was ordered released on conditions including that the Court would ordinarily be cursory in its usual cursory setting and would ordinarily present himself to any peace officer checking a curfew. 4)He would not be restricted from consuming alcohol and cannabis and shall not enter or be in the habit of drinking or in the presence of any of the accused. The court found that the substantial likelihood he would, if release from custody, commit a serious offence was not seriously questioned."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","Wacky's filed an appeal from a decision by the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. At issue was whether the defendant contractor had a contractual relationship with the plaintiff, and whether the plaintiff received compensation for the flooring. The evidence at trial was that some subcontractors were not paid by the defendant, and the plaintiff was not paid for flooring materials that had been ordered from the defendant's store. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that in almost all of the cases the defendant had a knowledge of the benefit, and he must have either requested it or acquiesced to its performance. The court found that there was no special relationship between the defendant and the applicant, and that the plaintiff had always received compensation from the defendants. The defendant was entitled to be paid. The appeal court found the evidence that the defendant entered into contracts with the plaintiffs to provide flooring for the plaintiff and then returned the floor materials to the plaintiff. The Adjudicators failed to find that the Small claims court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. The trial judge was correct in finding that in most of the situations the defendant was unaware that the work was being performed, and so it was held that no special bond existed."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.",The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in the backseat of a vehicle when the officer approached him. The officer smelled marijuana coming from the accused's person. The second officer smelled a strong smell of marijuana coming out of the accused. The third officer approached the accused and noted a strong odor of marijuana. The first officer smelled something burning. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded. The statement of the second officer to the police was found not to be voluntary. The issues were: 1) the accused was not under arrest; he was not physically restrained; the officer did not detect the smell of burned marijuana on him; 2) the officer smelled strong smell marijuana coming directly from the person of the arrested accused; 3) the third officer smelled the smell marijuana on the accused when he approached him and when he was asked to exit the vehicle; 4) the decision was not dependant on whether the officer had sufficient basis for arrest; 5) the facts were not in dispute; the accused elected not to testify on the voir dire and the court found that the officer's subjective belief that the accused is in possession of marijuana was objectively reasonable. The court found no section 10(b) violation prior to the officer giving his statement to the court and found that his statement was found free and voluntary.
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to comply with two provisions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (the Act and the Fall Prevention and Scolding Regulations). He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and he fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. The defendant was given a global fine of $2,000, which he was fined $3,500. The defendants appealed. Appeal dismissed. Although the defendant understood the requirements of the Act and fell victim to a hazard of falling, he did not take every reasonable precaution to avoid the occurrence.

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage.

He had been employed by a long distance trucker for a number of years and was considered good and reliable employee. His employer advised him that because of the nature of their business and the uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had to terminate his employment. He was unable to obtain similar employment. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. The court ordered that the appellant appeal his conviction and that it substituted an absolute discharge. It was clear that the appeal would be successful if it was in the best interest of the appellant and his family and that his rehire status while not guaranteed would be 'pretty fair'. The appellant is not a person requiring personal deterrence and rehabilitation through the use of correctional facilities or treatment centres is not factor. He is person of good character who made an error in judgment. The offence is not one that requires an element of general deterrence to deter others."

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.","A medical doctor was reassessed and ordered to repay hospital billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Medical doctor had reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Committee which misinterpreted the legislation and their duty under that legislation. HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside on the merits. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that the doctor's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials. 2)The Committee did not have the discretion vested in it by the legislation in conducting its review. The committee did not abuse its jurisdiction. 3)The findings of fact were not reasonably supported by the evidence and there was no basis for setting aside the decision on this basis. 4)The committee exceeded its scope by abusing its discretion. The evidence, all of which was provided by the medical doctor, should lead the Committee towards the inevitable conclusion that his practice is more economical than other cardiologists. There was no evidence to support the Committee's determination on the basis of any of the above."

She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant sold computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities. The respondent was hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of four Atlantic provinces. She was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. Her job was to make sales contacts, co-ordinate the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system for the customer. The sales compensation plan provided for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in the contract. The contract provided for six months' notice. She received no reason for her dismissal, and her compensation was increased on appeal to $20,000 and $50,000, respectively. The jury found that the respondent was entitled to six months notice to terminate the contract, and to additional damages of $60,000 for mental distress. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada arguing that damages in wrongful dismissal cases arise only from a breach of the contract of employment, and that the decision cannot be made compensable by merely adding a compensable claim."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff brought an action for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was commenced for wrongful dismiss or, as stated in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules, for breach of contract or, seeking damages for wrongful termination without adequate cause. The plaintiff was given three days' notice which was more than the usual two days. The first day of work was disconcerting to her as the defendant operated from the defendant's books before the defendant’s own set of books were put into use. The second day of the work was not satisfactory to the plaintiff as she was not able to take any tasks done during the period given. The third day of leave was spent dealing with various problems with the defendant. The fourth day of rest was spent in the office with no one speaking to me. Finally, at the end of the period of leave, the plaintiff was to be given written warning listing grievances of the employer. The defendant was to deduct the amounts owing by the plaintiff from the defence exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect examination by plaintiff’ s.2 counsel. Equal latitude may be required in the plaintiff”s cross- examination of the defendant witnesses."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs entitlement to holiday pay was actually wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $250,000 in damages. The court reviewed the various LSA definitions and found that the definition of holidays is a scheme for tax evasion and the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. The claim for holiday pay in lieu of holidays was dismissed. The amount of holiday pay awarded to the plaintiff in lieu was $1,000. The onus in wrongful dismissal cases rests with the plaintiff. Even if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday compensation in lieuof time off, he must be awarded the damages in lieu thereof. The Court noted that holiday pay is only awarded in lieu if the defendant obtains overtime. The claims of holiday compensation and holiday pay are inseparable from the actual loss of the holiday."
6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. on suspicion of impaired driving. At 1:42 a.M. roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the roadside screening. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample pursuant to s254(3) of The Code. At 2:40 the accused indicated that he was driving his truck 70 km per hour in 40 km zone. Upon arriving at the RCMP detachment at 2:12 am, the officer noted a smell of liquor and blood alcohol coming from the accused. At 3:40, the roadside test was performed. The defence demanded that the officer provide a sample. The police officer stated that he preferred that someone else administer the test when he is the arresting officer and he did not go to Martensville or Warman as he had found that there was rarely anyone at either location or in any case anyone who can administer test. The Defence urged the court to decide this issue at the outset. The Crown urged it to be decided at the beginning. HELD: The accused's application for production of maintenance records was dismissed. 1) The accused had not established that the defence had a duty to produce and present evidence to the Court of Appeal once the Certificate of Analysis was filed. 2) The defence had no reason to insist upon the production of the records once the application was made. The Court of Justice concluded that the failure of the Crown to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the defence was a serious issue and it was necessary to discharge the Charter's burden of proof once it was established that it infringed upon the accused's Charter rights. The request for production should not have been made lightly. The requested production of documents was not an attempt to justify or justify the failure to produce standard alcohol solutions. The evidence was straightforward and reliable. 3) The Court found that the respondent's Charter Rights had been infringed and it is necessary to discharged the application once it has been established that whatever reason the defence has not provided, it remains a burden to prove. Once it has established that this burden has been placed on the accused, it is discharged accordingly."

The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","An application for determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. The husband and wife parties had each served a request for information and documents pursuant to s.231.2 of the Income Tax Act seeking disclosure of 25 document documents. The parties had all been in contact and prepared various documents for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the accountant. The accountant had forwarded the documents to the applicant's solicitor, who forwarded those documents to SGI for production. HELD: The question is not whether the accounting firm has solicitor- client privilege but whether it has the privilege to produce the documents for that purpose. The central issue is the extent to which solicitor-privilege can be asserted in relation to communications between the parties for the purposes of obtaining advice from them. The evidence in this case is that the husband and the wife parties were acting as agents for the accountant and not as agents or representatives of the client. The wife and husband's relationship as representatives of their client was privileged and extended to include the accountant's involvement in the preparation of the documents.  1)The accountant was acting as representative of the clients for obtaining legal advise. 2)The parties' communications were privileged and extend to include any documents prepared by the applicant for the specific purpose of seeking legal advice. 3)Privilege extended to communications with and from third parties for purposes of seeking advice from.  4)Theater and model of solicitor-server privilege was established in the sense that the parties were communicating through documents prepared for the accountants. The privileged communications extended to documents prepared or obtained by the applicants for the intended purpose of requesting legal advice or for the service of the applicant. The more general privilege extended to those documents which were prepared for or produced for the sole purpose of receiving legal advice by the appellant. The less privileged communications were those prepared by third parties and extended only to documents that were prepared by them for the express purpose of soliciting legal advice and not by the parties themselves. 5)Privileged communications were not only privileged but also included extras and extras.

HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 753(a)(i) and persistent aggressive behaviour contrary to (753(1)(b)). The accused had been previously charged with two breaches of no-contact conditions. The accused pled guilty to two related offences stemming from his breaches of breaches of NO-contact Conditions. The defence had sought an order that the accused be declared a dangerous offender. The facts of the case showed that the Crown had not met the three conditions set out in s. 1 of the Criminal Code, namely that the offence of assault was a serious personal injury offence as defined in Part XXIV and that the defendant had demonstrated that he could not control his behaviour and that he would not be able to abet the risk in the community. The court imposed a sentence of 10 years."
7_2014skpc84.txt,"Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers and occupied highway Equipment when he was travelling faster than60 km per Hour. The accused was the only witness for the defence. He testified that he did not speed past any highway workers nor occupied highway machinery in the work zone and claimed that the speed monitoring camera must have photographed his vehicle. The Crown submits that the offence under subsection 203(2) of The Traffice safety Act is strict liability, and that its documentary Evidence proves every aspect of it. The fact that no workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused's vehicle makes it not guilty. The evidence consisted of the following documents: 1) a photograph of a vehicle taken by a speed monitoring system showing the date and time the photograph was taken and the speed of the vehicle when the photograph were taken, which in this case was 84 kms/hr; 2) an SGI Motor Vehicle Division search certifying that the driver was the registered owner of the car on the date of the alleged offence; 3) affidavits of service confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, and the SGI motor vehicle division certified search. The Act allows the accused to ask for an order requiring the judge to attend for the purpose of cross-examination, but the accused did not do so. The defence was able to ask that the judge attend for cross- examination but the Act allows that the applicant do not do this."
7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest as claimed in the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax Act. The defendant cementing and reservoir stimulation service contractors (the 'Third Party'), together with the cementing service contractors paid $393,289.73 on well cementing contracts. The parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government of Saskatchewan to Husky at trial. The Government of SGI joined the cementers as third parties in this action and the parties agreed to supply and install the equipment for the plaintiff's well. The plaintiff claims that the third party contractors breached s. 50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act by failing to remit the PST to the third parties. The claim against the thirdparty contractors is barred by s.50(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act and s. 56(1) ofthe Provincial Sales tax Act. HELD: Even if the Government was not liable to pay the PST, the third-party contractors properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff. 1)Even if the government was entitled to refund of PST from the third Party, the parties' intention in entering the contracts was not contained exclusively in the terms and conditions of the contracts. 2)The parties agreed that the tax was applicable to the plaintiff as long as the amount was reduced by virtue of the limitation period set forth in s.56 of the Department of National Revenue Act. 3)The plaintiff was entitled, in whole or in part, to refund the PST on the materials it consumed in performance of its contracts with the third partners. The third parties properly levied the tax on the material they consumed in the performance of their contracts with Husky. The plaintiffs were entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $419 million. 4)The defendants were not entitled to the refund of the PST. 5)The plaintiffs were awarded interest on the amount owing Husky Oil for well cement. The defendants were entitled, inter alia, to $419.64 for the period 1996 to 2001. The claims against them are barred by ss.50 of The Excise and Services Act and the Limitations Act. 6)The third party contractor was not entitled, at all, to the tax. The tax is payable by the third and fourth party contractors on the well construction contracts. Husky was entitled and did implicitly or explicitly reply to the Government's position and actions in the statement of defence and relied on the fact that it was licensed under the Revenue & Financial Services"
8_1993canlii4689.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries suffered as a result of his car being hit from behind. He had continued pain in the neck, shoulder, back and hip four and one half years after the accident. Throughout this period, the plaintiff missed only three days and then three weeks of work. The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain. Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate. The court found the injury was mild and not the cause of the continued pain. The plaintiff was found to have chronic pain syndrome.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident when his car was struck by the defendant's vehicle. He worked as a technician for several years, then as a supervisor for four years. He changed jobs in the ensuing years, claiming damages for personal injuries and special damages which he did not recover from. He suffered myofascial or chronic pain, mainly relating to his left hip, which was chronic pain. He had stopped working as a result of the accident, and suffered from severe back pain four and a half years ago. He underwent successful surgery to repair his hip, had a successful surgery two years later and resumed physical activity four and one half years later. He was diagnosed as having myofasiscial or Chronic pain, but his pain was no more than mild.

The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994 and after a hearing in two separate hearings, the deputy rentalsman (who conducted the hearing) released his decision which the landlord sought to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsmansman (whom the Court had previously dealt with in separate hearings) then served the tenants with a notice of the termination of the tenancy. The tenants appealed this decision and sought a leave of absence from the Court. Dismissing the appeal and restoring the decision of the deputy rentalman, that where the application is made to the rentalsman, the appellate jurisdiction of the Queen's Bench is restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The accused, a 23 year old aboriginal, pled guilty to two offences of robbery and robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code, including a sentence of nine months time served, plus two years less one day conditional, including three months on electronic monitoring, plus 2 years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence set aside. A sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each count to be serve concurrently was to be imposed. The accused was 23 years old aboriginal with a prior record consisting of 42 criminal convictions, eight violent or weapons related offences. He has violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times. He had a grade three education and did not have significant employment history.

8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellants appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench judge who found, as a matter of fact, that the bank deposits and proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to the appellant by his sister, who brought an action against him for the same purpose. The residuary beneficiaries brought an application against the appellant claiming that the funds were a part of the residue of the estate and for the amounts they, the granddaughters, should have received. The appellant sought relief under s. 57 of The Queen's Trustee Act, R.S.S., qua. 23 in respect of the monies paid by him to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the sister, and sought relief from the trial judge for the amount they should have been paid. The trial judge found, in his factum, that Ms. Little intended the funds to go to the respondents, the residuary beneficiary named in the will, and that they were given for the benefit of her grandchildren and grandchildren. The appellants argued that the trial court erred in law in failing to consider the effect of s. 59 of The Trustee act, which gives the benefit to the grandchild and the great- grandchildren, when the gift of bank deposits, investment accounts and RRIFs is made. The respondent, in her factum concerning the RRI, referred to the fact that the appellant intended the money to go towards the grandchildren. This conclusion was supported by the evidence. The appeal was dismissed with costs under Double Column V in the usual way."

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent was asked to discharge her assets from her estate. She had received funds from her insurer prior to her bankruptcy, and had undertaken an extensive rehabilitation program. She now sought to discharge these assets. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. She was entitled, however, to pay back the creditors, along with any surplus income she had received prior to bankruptcy. She paid these assets back in full plus the sum of $300 for the horses and any surplus surplus income that might be recovered from the horses. She should be able to stabilize her family finances as soon as possible. 1)The respondent's evidence at the hearing was that she did not provide funds for the purchase of her present residence. She indicated that she had not received any funds from the insurer priorto her bankruptcy. 2)The trustee was not asked to order the respondent to pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months. 3)The court found that the respondent had exceeded her means in valuing and inspecting the three horses. The court found it appropriate that the trustee pay surplus incomes of $326 per month, for the 9 month basic bankruptcy time, and to deal with the issue of whether the respondent should be allowed to keep the horses or to compensate for the loss of household goods which might have been lost due to the respondent's personal circumstances."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities.

The plaintiffs seek a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring the defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year. They also seek an order requiring the parties to proceed with expedited arbitration. HELD: The motions to strike are dismissed. It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring defendants tomake the required retroactive assessment payments before January 2011. Neither party sees a viable solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is not a viable option. The retroactive payment does not form part of the retiree's 2010 income. The retiring employee's pension is accordingly reduced. The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle. The essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which in accordance with the CAA are beyond the jurisdiction of the court. HOLD: It is appropriate to grant the defendants an injunction that requires them to make retroactive payments before December 2010. Neither parties see a viable prospect of a solution to this problem by a later time than fully compiled payments. In the long run the results of such solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. The plaintiff's motions to walk out of the courtroom were dismissed."

The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","The accused was charged with two counts of driving over.08. The first charge was of driving while intoxicated. The second was of being in the driver's seat of a vehicle. The accused had stated that the vehicle was his neighbour's. The complainant advised the police that the accused was being detained because she thought that the driver of the vehicle had smashed into her car and had driven off. The police attended to the complainant’s house after receiving a complaint that the complainant had driven into her vehicle and had then violently smashed it into it. The officer attended to investigate the complainant and found the accused lying on the ground. The defence argued that the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for further investigation, but that they did not have sufficient information to detain him. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  1)The police had no reasonable grounds to arrest the accused. They were simply acting in a manner that offended or disturbed the public’ s interests. The exclusion of the evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was the operator of the motor vehicle. 2)The accused had been detained for the investigation of the hit and run. The RCMP had already been contacted by the complainant. They had reviewed his driver’ll and licence. Once the police were able to locate the vehicle, they arrested the accused and searched him. The court concluded that the arrest and detention were both justified in view of the public interest. The search and seizure of the accused’ personal belongings and the seizure of his keys and fob were in total breaches of the defence’S right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizures.

With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Board cannot rely on a blanket prohibition to deny reimbursement for medical marijuana is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. The Board's decision to deny reimbursements on the basis that medical marijuana has not been proven and is not necessary or required in all cases falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and law. The board's decision that it has the power to deny reimbursed for medical cannabis meets the standard of reasonableness. 1) Based on what the Board did in its decision regarding the reimbursement of medical marijuana, the board's interpretation of the law granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable and deference must be given to it. 2) Based upon the wording and the contexts of the applicable provisions, it is of the view that the board’s interpretation that it granted the board discretion to deny medical marijuana was reasonable and it was within range of reasonable outcomes supported by the evidence. There was no evidence that the respondent based its decision on the evidence before it but based its conclusion on irrelevant considerations. 3) The Board found that it had the power (under s. 22(1) of the Accessibility and Skills Act) to determine all matters arising under the Act. The applicant’d been denied reimbursement for a medication that had worked for him for 10 years and that had been recommended by an expert. The doctor was not aware of the drug. The medical marijuana product was legal in Canada and was approved in the United States. The Health Canada Act does not provide an explicit prohibition to medical marijuana use. The wording of s. 106(1)(b) and s. 102(1(1)) of the accessibility and skills Act requires. 4) The board found that its power to refuse reimbursement was reasonable but this is not the case here. The decision to decline reimbursement on the grounds that medical marihuana is not proven and therefore not necessary, and the Board had no authority to determine whether such treatment is necessary or necessary, falls within a range of acceptable outcomes supported in the evidence and deferent must be accorded to it"
8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president's personal recommendation to the Board was not required, and the Board's power to follow the president’s recommendation did not fall within the scope of the Agreement. The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of the University Act and in particular s. 52. 2. The interpretation of the s.51 by the arbitrators was not correctness or reasonableness. Both parties relied on the Rucker decision, which held that the President’d recommendation to appoint a probationary assistant professor was not mandatory, and that the Board had not been obliged to follow their president”s recommendation. HELD: The dispute was decided on the basis of Rucker’ s. 45 decision and the interpretation of ss. 51 and 51. 2 of the Saskatchewan Act.  1) The Act hardly uses the term tenure at all and not directly in this context. The existence of s.(3)(b) makes it more difficult to conclude the President's authority should be personal and unfettered, and in my view more reasonable to conclude that it is power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. 2) The Arbitrators found after reviewing The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995, S. 6.1 (the Act) and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the president in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The results of the arbitration were appealed. 3) The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents."
8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","HELD: The application was granted in part and the balance of probabilities were considered. The court found that the accused had reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the Internet search history, was in a position of trust and authority toward a person aged 16 years for a sexual purpose, touch directly or indirectly with a part of the body, any part of that body of a person under the age of 18, and that the suggested criminal offence was not contained in the ITO. The accused was found not guilty of the charge under s.271 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant's discussion with the accused about the alleged sexual assault was entered to amplify what the accused actually swore to in theITO. There was no evidence as to whether any of the messages between the accused and the complainant were obtained. The trial judge found that it was reasonable and inadmissible to exclude the evidence of that particular person from the ITOs because the accused was not a known Internet user and the information was known to the police at the time of the search."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. The applicant failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and the estate subsequently sued Armoyano for breach of the contract. Dismissing the application, that Armoyand was entitled to continue the ditch to a proper outlet and required the consent of the adjacent property owners. Armoyande was not entitled to construct a ditch or drain across the Haverstock estate. The developer's proposal to convey roadways to the Department of Transportation and Communications failed to achieve agreement. Armoysand was awarded costs of $3,000.00. The court found that Armoysant was entitled, by virtue of s.5(1) of the Act, to construct the ditch or ditch across the estate. HELD: The Court awarded costs to the applicant in the amount of $1,000, and made no order for costs for or against the applicant.  1)The Act provides a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch and drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means by which will be determined the necessary technical details of the drainage. This is not in accordance with the provisions of the Expropriation Act. 2)The applicant was entitled only to pay his fees in accordance to the provisions in the Act.  3)The respondent was not awarded costs for the hearing."
9_1996canlii8701.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs. He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system; and 'electronic' means anything that, by this Act, only the owner of the copyright has the right to do. The appellant contended that the Crown did not prove that the appellant distributed the copyrighted material, that the appellants had the requisite knowledge, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that all the evidence supported the findings of the trial judge which were not reasonable or unreasonable questions to be asked of the appellant."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code and with driving over.08 contrary to ss. 253C and 253(b). The issues were whether there was a breach of the accused's s. 8 and s9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand, and whether there were reasonable and possible grounds for a breath demand. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge under s. 249(a)(c) of The Criminal Code. The officer observed the accused sleeping through the lights and at red light, and thereafter awoke him when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. He appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot was not reliable. The accused's eyes were slightly glassy and he appeared to be slightly bloodshot. The police officer walked him back to the police vehicle and did not observe any problems with balance or walking. The Ontario Court of Appeal judgment made reference to the so-called classic signs of impairment, namely erratic driving, glassy eyes, glassiness on one's feet, slurred speech and unsteadiness on the feet. The Court of Justice held that the officer was able to conclude with brief and cursory observation of the individual that reasonable and reasonable grounds for breath demand had not been established. Therefore, the accused was not guilty under s253(a). The accused is not guilty in the charge of impaired driving."
9_2002nssc264.txt,"The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores. The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff obtained a twenty-five year lease for a supermarket. The landlord promised to restrict competition by other tenants. The latter co-venanted to use the premises for the sale of groceries, fish, fowl, frozen food, fruit or vegetables and the lease amendments. The clause in the lease provided that the Lessee shall use the Leased Premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising as carried on by the rest of the stores. This was uncontraverted. The receiver applied by way of originating notice for a permanent injunction. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the Sobeys lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no dispute as to the lease amendment. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontravert. The Lessee has put forward evidence which, if properly put together, may show that it is in compliance with its terms as amended. There are no other reasons why the plaintiffs would be unable to prosecute their claim and, if successful, collect on a money judgment. The potential, and the insubstantial, nature of the potential dispute is one of the factors driving the application for a temporary injunction."
9_2003skqb481.txt,The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine. The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied to have the hearing set down pursuant to s. 29 of the Extradition Act. The accused was granted bail pending his extradition hearing and then granted bail. The issue was whether the accused was entitled to disclosure of the evidence in his custody or control. HELD: The motion on behalf of the accused for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. 1)It is alleged that the Attorney General has not disclosed all the evidence. Counsel for the Attorney general however has undertaken that everything within the control of the AttorneyGeneral has been turned over to the solicitor for the accused except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General had only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2)The accused argued that the application was under s. of the Charter and no consideration was given to parallel common law rights advanced on behalfof the accused, specifically, denial of natural justice. 3)The motion on the behalf of Griffiths's solicitor was without merit and it was accordingly dismissed. 4)The role of the extradition judge is a modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case that the extradition crime was committed. The extradition hearing must necessarily result in either committal under s29(1) which places the matter once again before the AttorneyG or discharge under s3.5. The motion to set a date for the extradition hearing was to proceed on January 6, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. or at such other date and time as counsel may agree upon in consultation with the Local Registrar."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s. s. 6.3, initiated by a nurse, against a doctor, who had lived together for several years. The two had lived Together for severalyears. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and that they had cohabitated with one another continuously for two years. He held that this relationship had begun in late June 1994, whereas the parties' distribution was governed by s. 21 and 23 of the act. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Whether the trial judge erred in concluding the appellant, who acquired the house in October 1994, acquired it after the commencement of spousal relationship, rather than before. It follows that the value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the legislation.  2) Whether he erred by failing to give effect to the gift of $125,000 the appellant had received from his mother in September 1994, is a matter for the Court to determine. 3) Whether it would be unfair and inequitable to allow the respondent in whole or in part having regard for the matters mentioned in s. 22 of theAct. The matter was governed in part by s21 and s22 rather than s21. As the respondent's application extended to the house, it was unable in principle to claim any right, title, or interest in the house itself. It followed that the property does not qualify as a family home. 4) Whether a party has become 'Spouses' in the Act, pursuant to s23(1) and (c), shall be determined in relation to the distribution of family property or in Part 1 of the Family Property act. The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell (1999), 180 Sask.R. 196 (Sask. C.A.). 5) The Court found that the evidence presented by the parties all supported the findings of fact and in accord with the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal. The significance of this finding was that the fact that the respondent, who bought the house prior to the commencement spousals, acquired the property as a first and second home of the parties and then, in September 1995, borrowed $100,000 from his parents to purchase the house and then sold it to his parents in January 2000, having obtained a further house before the commencement"
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","The Crown appealed a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The offender was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The Crown had already served 45 days in custody on remand. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender and the principles of sentencing set out in the Youth Code. 2) The respondent was already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence was to be set aside. In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by a period of community supervision of 6 months and a 1 year firearms ban. He will also be subject to a 10% firearms prohibition as in the original sentence. 3) The sentencing judge in B.W.P. concluded that the principles governing deterrence were not a factor to be taken into account and could not be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offence would warrant. Nor was specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant, a niece of the testator, applied for removal as executor of her will. The deceased testator was 99 years old and had difficulties with eyesight and hearing. He had difficulty comprehending and responding coherently to the questions asked on discovery. The applicant argued that the evidence given by the executor on discovery raised grave concerns about his mental competency to continue to act as executory and suggested that he had passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship, to a third party. The executor's niece, a former employee of the estate, also applied for a declaration that she was the alternate executor. Application to remove the executrator dismissed; the applicant's niece was found to be the sole beneficiary. Although the applicant had difficulties hearing and hearing, and appeared to have some recollection of certain events but a weak grasp of other events, the court was satisfied that the executator had met his primary duty of care and that he was entitled to clear instructions to the beneficiaries. The testator's health was poor and he had difficulty paying his legal fees. The court was not satisfied that he would be able to perform the tasks assigned to him by the will, nor that he understood the purpose of the tasks delegated to him. The only person at risk was the executrix, who was the only beneficiary of the will."
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: The applicant Contracting Ltd. applied for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 requiring the respondents to deliver four pieces of equipment. The four pieces were rented by the respondents from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into in 2008. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was seized by the owner of the equipment leaving it in the possession of another acquaintance of the owner. The equipment was subsequently removed from the owner's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken, an acquaintance of Bruce's. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. 1)The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession of it.

He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He applied to quash a decision of the College of Medicine Academic Appeals Committee and of the University Bylaws Committee. HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. The applicant was successful quashing the decision of both the College and University Bishops Committee and sought an order reinstating him as a student at the Collegeof Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. The Bylaw Committee exceeded its jurisdiction and its decision was therefore quashed. It was not appropriate for the Court to usurp the function of the BylAW Committee and review the material to determine if the substance of the appeal fell within Part V, para. 3. The matter was returned to the Byleaws Committee for a decision according to law that is whether the applicant's appeal falls within Part VI, the policy on student appeals and academic matters."
9_2012skqb99.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process. HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: A major hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National) as receiver. In 2008 both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. Within a year both corporations, both corporations and the owners, each obtained notice of National's intention to realize on its security. National arranged for the appointment of a receiver. HELD: Both applications were dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case were virtually identical, the complexity of them made it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. 1) The present claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. 2) The pleadings filed by the defendant fail to disclose reasonable defences to the plaintiff's foreclosure proceedings; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of warranties are otherwise an abuse of the process of this court."

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"HELD: The accused was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the evidence did not support the conviction. The sentencing judge was required to find the facts for the purposes of sentencing. The accused had 67 previous convictions, most of which related to thefts and break and enters. The offence was committed as a principal and/or as party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence. The evidence that the accused was not the perpetrator was not accepted by the jury. The offender had a lengthy criminal record. Most of the convictions relate to thefts. Most relate to robberies and break-ins. The jury verdict established that the two accused broke and entered the complainant’s home and participated as principal or party in the aggravated assault."

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly.

He was working on a project to remove trees from a public highway.

The plaintiff sued the defendants, alleging dereliction of duty, for letting the defendant remove the trees that were an immediate hazard to the public. Dismissing the action, that there was no evidence of dereliction on the part of the defendant, that the tree fell because of a mechanical wound or because of some type of machinery malfunction.

b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2, s.3, s2, and s. Charter.

The accused were compelled to plead guilty to three counts each. 5)The Actus reus element of s.302 was met. 6)Section 301 was of sufficient importance to justify an infringement of s2(b) of the Charter. 7)The test of proportionality was met in R. v. Oakes (1988) 1 S.2(d) for the purposes of this application. 8)The court was not faced with a reverse onus under s.303 because it was based on the truth of the defamatories material.

Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.

The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research, from January 1983 to May 1993.

The defendant had initially asked the plaintiff to take 19.871 days of combined time in-lieu and annual leave, which she did not receive. She turned it down because the job was too risky and the duties were materially different from those at her job with Gabriel DumONT.

The court assessed them under the head of $1,325 for the period of 9 months and $2,324 for the amount for the 9 months. 2)Pre-judgment interest was awarded in the amount of $31,737.93."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse.

There was an issue of spousal maintenance which required a determination of John's income. The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child for a period of 1 year, to be paid in full by him when he retired. This amount was reduced to $600 due to the respondent's failure to pay support for the children in the amount of $50,000 per year.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. The defendant had been an employer for many years and had a contract with a Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in the town. The Hamlet hired a nephew of the defendant to install the lines. The nephew was not able to perform the work as the defendant had intended but the defendant paid the money and provided a first aid station to the workers. The defendants had obtained a contract to install sewers and water line on four properties. The applicant obtained a backhoe, backhoe and gasoline to supply the workers with tools. The backhoe was rented by the defendant and the defendant provided the backhoe's backhoe with the piping and gasoline. The arrangement was that the defendant would supply the backhoes, the piping, the gasoline and the pipe to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were paid wages on an hourly basis and the defendants used a back-hoe to lay pipe. The court found that the defendants had an obligation to provide and maintain for the work site a readily accessible first aid kit. The Court found that once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure the usual protocols for job safety are met. The evidence showed that the relationship between the defendant, the contractor and the workers was one of employer to worker and that no inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific supervision."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.

The accused argued that the evidence did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. He attacked the evidence of the ambulance attendants and police officer who came along later that the accused had attempted to start the vehicle after they woke him up. HELD: The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence and the evidenceof the Crown witnesses to support the conviction. The appeal was dismissed. 1)The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The accused had much different story. He clearly accepted the evidence that the ambulance attendant and police officers and the police officer over the accused's version of what took place.  2)It is clear from the acceptance of the evidence in the ambulance and police evidence that there was a physical altercation between the accused and the ambulance personnel that the Court found that the appellant, while intoxicated, was nevertheless in de facto control of his vehicle. The Court found the accused guilty of count two of the Information.

Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial.

He was attending to pick lumber for a job when he tripped and fell. He estimated the distance of 13 1/2 to be approximately 2.5 km. The court awarded the plaintiff $8,500 by way of general damages. The plaintiff had been involved in overseeing his business for many years and had not seen anything located on the side of the desk facing towards the glass. He claimed to have been injured in the knee when he first entered the premises. Counsel for the plaintiff reviewed number of cases involving assessments of damages for knee injuries and concluded that the sum of $1,000 was more than reasonable in the circumstances.

b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule of perpetuity. HELD: 1)The trial court held that it was only after the time of vesting had been ascertained that a determination could be made about whether that time was too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule. 2)The parties' proposed farmout agreement, made between the respondent and the applicant, was not considered void under the rule, but rather in contravened by the fact that it could have been done any other way. 3)The respondent chose to negotiate a farmout deal with the defendant, Tarragon, which was to use a copy of the original 1950 Freeholders lease. Under the habendum clause in the lease, the primary term was for ten years from April 1949 and thereafter as leased substances were produced from the land until 1959. If the lease expired at the end of the primary year, Travagon would have to pay Tarrago's share of the proceeds. 4)The court declined to admit that the respondent had breached the common law rule against fraud. The court found that the phrase 'in the event' is equivalent to'reversionary interest'. 5)The phrase 'up until the termination of the first term' was used in the Freeholders agreement. The wording of the lease is in accordance with the common laws definition equivalent to way of describing a reversionary Interest. 6)The plaintiff was very interested in developing or participating in the development of the mines and minerals within the Taylor land. However, it was not yet aware that the term 'in event' connotes time and condition and not property or an interest in property. The uncertainty precluded it from simply proceeding on its own."
b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the wrongdieer. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English versions of the Act. The limitation on damages (i.e. 'damage that would have been recoverable if only there had been a death penalty applicable in those jurisdictions) was not an old statute that was ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. The only question on this appeal is whether, if, if McDonald was at fault, the estate would be entitled to claim damages for Paul's lost earning capacity. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The survival of action legislation contained a number of exclusions, limitations and other limitations not in the original provisions of the 1934 Act. 2)The limitation on costs was not a finding that the estate could afford to pay the wrong-doer what they would have received had he lived. The estate could, therefore, sue the right-doers for damages arising out of the wrongful death. 3)The common law principles applicable to survival of means legislation were not new to Nova Scotia. The provisions of this legislation were broadly applicable to all situations where a person's life had been shortened or he had been killed by the defendant (except defamation, seduction and inducing one spouse to leave another) but their exclusion from the survival of steps legislation was a straightforward restriction on costs arising out the death penalty applied in those jurisdiction."
b_2003skqb117.txt,"An application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184(1)(a) and/or Queen's Bench Act s.29 in accordance with the minutes of settlement agreed to follow the pre-trial conference. The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference. Rule 184A provides that the plaintiff may apply for judgment pursuantto s. 1(b) of the accepted offer and for relief pursuant to s. 2(1) of that offer. The resulting agreement should be recognized and enforced by our courts. Otherwise the primary purpose of the pretrial conference is lost and the necessary information and compliance with s. 28.1 of the Queen'sBench Act is not available. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Minutes of settlement provided. 2)There was no suggestion that the settlement was amended or altered at that time. Nor that the balance of $15,000 did not remain owing. 3)There is no suggestion any of the parties and their solicitors were involved. 4)The enforceability of the settlement agreement can be determined by reading and interpreting its terms. The defendant opposed the application solely on the basis that the claim was struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 27.1(Q.1)of the Queen’s Bench Act, 1998. 5)The plaintiff was entitled to rely on the minutes of the Settlement. The court could not find anything that would make the application more difficult or impossible. The minutes of silence provided by the defendant were found to be not those of the Parties and their counsel.  6)The court was not able to enter into any order with respect to the settlement or to the application of the motion to compel a declaration of compliance with the terms of the agreement. 7)The defendant was to pay $20,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement (July 16, 2002). 8)The parties agreed to allow a consent default judgment in favour of the defendant in the amount of $20k.

b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.",HELD: The application was directed. The court found that the primary residence of the child required a change in circumstances. The petitioner had failed to make regular payments of spousal and child support and had foreclosed the option of returning to the Kindersley district. The issue was determining the primary resident of the Child Development Certificate (CDCC) under the Archerwill Act. The decision was made jointly with the respondent. The evidence showed that the child had a personality that allows him to adjust easily to changes in circumstances and that he especially liked being in the home of his biological parent. The respondent was to continue to live with his mother. The change in circumstance did not result in any disruption to the child's already close relationship with his biological parents.
b_2007skqb1.txt,"This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","The appellant asserted a palpable and overriding error by the trial judge in accepting as fact part of the testimony of the respondent who accepted the amount as being the correct quantum of his counterclaim, and for accepting the witness testimony that an amount was also owing to the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable and overarching error by either party. The trial judge had an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact. He had an absolute discretion to determine the truth of the transaction or the amount owing to him. However, the trial court judge did not accept the testimony by the appellant particularly on the mutual acknowledgement of the two parties' mutual debt. That principle was not before the trial judges nor argued on this appeal. 2)There had been a palpable or overriding error, including a palpable but overriding error. The appellant was not persuaded that the judgment was not reasonably supported by the evidence. There was no evidential or overriding errors in the judgment."

As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) dated June 16th, 2010 and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant's claim that he did not know the hearing took place and, when he failed to show up, Judgment was awarded against him. The Respondent appeals that judgment by Notice Of Appeal (see below). The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he didn't attend the hearing. It is not a reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra, that he was mistaken about the date of the hearing and was mistaken as to what would be the outcome of his absence. Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the defendant the new hearing date."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The applicant had not followed the lead of the other defendants in seeking to have the mortgage foreclosed on. The court found that the Land was Farmland within the meaning of the SFSA in that the mortgage was for $3,100,000 repayable by two installments of $300,000, then the balance payable on April 30, 2009. The mortgage was not subject to the terms of the previous mortgage. The only thing that would make this an 'open' sale was the fact that the proposed use of the land by the applicant was a proposal."

This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice. A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","Rule 4.07 – Rule 88.02 For the appellant, that he defended and took steps in the proceedings which precluded him from applying for a stay under s. of the Arbitration Act. More than two years after the suit started, he applied for a Stay of proceedings pursuant to Rule 4.06(3) and s. 4.08(3). Rule 4 was not so accommodating. It assumes an applicant for stay has not yet defended. More then two years later, he applies for a return to the action under Rule 4(3), which assumes an application for stay for want of jurisdiction is made. Rule 4 is not so accepting. It implies an applicant has not been defended. The appellant's defence was not confined to a plea of 'no jurisdiction' as he denied the substance of the claim. Nor, unlike the appellant in this case, was there any evidence that he was filing to avoid default judgment. Rather, he provided documents and attended discovery."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, who had obtained a portion of the land from the defendant, used the Borden driveway. He maintained a garden on the defendant's property and used it as a back-up to the defendant. The defendant, who owned the portion of land now owned by the defendant and his son, Roy, also used the driveway. Roy Longard's son, who was also a party to the agreement, claimed that the Bordens driveway was the defendant son's 'other driveway'. Roy Longards, the defendant who had been given the portion by the plaintiff and his brother, Roy Longardo, in 1986, used it in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the defendants. Roy had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 deed to the plaintiff was or incorporates the Bordene driveway. Prescription or 'Lost Modern Grant' (used by the plaintiffs in this case) is not shown. Roy's understanding is that he used the original driveway to access his property but he knew it was not the Bordener driveway. Having ascertained that the plaintiffs had a reasonable right of access to the property from the highway, they proceeded to obtain the right of way from the defendants who blocked off the defendant for them. Roy was granted the right to continue to use the driveway until he died in 1986. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action against the defendant in this regard."

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. The child had diminished cognitive abilities as she suffered from FASD and had challenges around understanding and retaining information despite presenting as though this was not the case. The mother alleged that the father had physically assaulted her and had threatened to kill anyone who entered the farm. The Minister did nothing to prevent this from happening and the parents agreed to joint custody with the child so that the child would not be in need of protection. The father was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act. The young parents were not able to care for the child and there was a risk that physical or emotional harm would occur to the child if returned to them. The plan put forward by the parents was to return the infant to the grandparents' home and have it placed with them as a person of sufficient interest for a period of 4 months. HELD: The child was in need protection from the Minister and the day it was apprehended that the parents had not provided sufficient assistance to the children and that physical harm was likely to occur to this six week old child. As the parents were unable to care and there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the children would be in any danger, either from abuse or neglect, the order was granted. The infant would remain in needof protection for four months. 1) The parents were no longer able to provide for the children. The children were no more able to parent than the parents. The grandparents were not capable of caring for the six weekold child. 2) The father had verbally abused the child, physically and verbally. The relationship was not fostered by the mother's or the father's prior relationship with the baby. The parenting was difficult and the children did not have the opportunity to develop a positive relationship with their father. The lack of parenting and the fact that the mother had limited contact with the father would result in the child not being in need Of protection."

The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed.

b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant applied to have the trial judge consider the evidence of the witnesses. He rejected the evidence that the complainant was only at the house for five or ten minutes and never went into the bedroom. The trial judge gave reasons for rejecting these aspects of the testimony, namely that both the complainant's siblings had been distracted while she was at the trial and that their relationship weakened the credibility of their testimony. The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission as set out in Palmer (1979), [1979] and [1980] SCR 759 at 775. 2) It is well understood that an appellate court must show great deference to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer and (1980) SCR 827. 3) The trial court found that the appellant had failed to adhere to and properly apply the principles and purposes of sentencing pursuant to s38 of the Code. It is also well understood in the context of this case that an appeal court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for that imposed by trial level court in only two circumstances. The first is when the sentence is demonstrably unfit and the second is when trial counsel made errors in assessing the credibilityof the witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. The parties were in a difficult position and were biased. The Court of Appeal found that it is more likely than not that the accused would comply with the conditions of non-custodial sentence. 4) The appellant had not established that the trial judges made errors when they considered the evidence. The errors resulted in the trial court making erroneous credibility assessments that put the credibility and reliability of the complainant and the appellant at risk. The court found no basis to interfere with the conviction appeal. 5) The Court found that a conviction appeal is not necessary and the trial decision was properly instructed and properly applied. The appellate court found there was no basis for the trial to interfere in the conviction. The sentence appeal is allowed and, pursuant to Lacasse, the sentence was variedto 12 months probation."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","The defendant applied for an adjournment following his conviction on a charge of fraud over $5,000. His counsel withdrew from the trial, and the defendant applied to have an adjournments granted. Application allowed; new trial ordered. Although the circumstances of this case did not appear to be in dispute, the Court found that there was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant an adjournlement because the defendant's wife was in the hospital and he was not seeking a fair trial; there was evidence that the defendant had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so for the purpose of delaying the trial; and there was nothing in the record which could legally support the presumption that a defendant's absence was a premeditated scheme in complicity with the accused."

Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The wife, who had recently changed jobs and had limited work experience, sought to have her assets and liabilities divided equally.

The husband sought to remove the collateral mortgage, which represented an unequal division of matrimony assets and should be deferred. Application for lump sum payment dismissed. The court found that the respondent's objectives were to have a clean break between the spouses, to have greater self-sufficiency, and to have equal access to the public funds. The courts in both provinces were required to consider the effect of the marriage on their future economic prospects, and accordingly the court ordered that the lump sum award be paid to the wife as agreed to by the parties."

The law firm had previously retained the respondent's former solicitor and had since terminated the petitioner's employment. The applicant's former law firm also retained the solicitor of the petitioner. HELD: 1)The respondent was to have the costs of the application be set aside and a screening policy be set up to ensure that no confidential information will pass between the lawyer and client. 2)The applicant was to attend a further examination to be arranged in consultation with counsel and on 10 days' notice of the date set for the examination and payment of proper conduct money. 3)The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement and to have all documents related to this motion sealed were dismissed.  4)The solicitor's position that there was a risk of a breach of confidentiality before the law company was not supported by the screening policy. The solicitor's obligation to act fairly and in accordance with s.2(8) of the Code of Conduct for new law firms was to be discharged.
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","An appeal of a decision of the LEAGUE of Educational Directors and Superintendents (EDDs) which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee, Executive Committee and the Student Assessment and Learning Center (SALC) found the applicant guilty of misrepresenting the report of the principal of a school division to the public. The discipline committee found the respondent guilty of threatening to resign as principal of the school when no reference was made. The SAAPC also found the defendant guilty of threats to violence. The defendant received a reprimand and a fine of $2,500. Both parties appealed the discipline committee's decision. Dismissing the charges, that the Discipline Committee erred in its finding that the appellant had misrepresented the report, that there were inappropriate inferences and conclusions reached, that these conclusions were not supported by the evidence, and that the defendant had acted in a dishonest and unprofessional manner. In addition, the discipline panel found that the applicant had intentionally caused the principal to believe that the report was critical of his leadership, that it could get ugly, and threatened the applicant with a transfer. The evidence did not support the imposition of the sentence."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant. The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments. The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act. The proper forum was to have the issues determined in the action commenced by the respondent.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order for the return of personal property security benefits pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act and an order under s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act that the respondent as lessor was limited to a lien upon the articles sold only, notwithstanding any contrary agreement between the parties. The parties entered into an agreement in 1997 that the lessor agreed to lease a tractor trailer unit to the applicant for payments. The vehicle was seized in 1997 and the respondent seized it in 1997. He claimed the sum of $5,330.81 from the applicant being the combined amount due and owing by the parties for arrears of lease payments with the value of goods required to be purchased pursuant to the agreement being tires and starter which the defendant did promise to pay to the plaintiff upon repossession and tires and Starter which the applicant did promise in 1997 to pay upon repossessing the collateral. The respondent issued a pre- judgment garnishee summons for the amount claimed. HELD: The application was dismissed. The proper forum to have the issues determined was the action commenced by the respondent. The application is simply an attempt to end run the action which has been commenced by him. The Court lacks the jurisdiction to grant the relief requested under Part V of the PPSSA. The Application is simply one attempt to continue the action. The forum to resolve the issues raised in this matter is the forum to which the issues may be determined. The action commenced at the respondent's direction."
c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. An application for determination of whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for personal injuries sustained while in the care of an infant or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant. HELD: 1)The first issue was whether the school board was immune from Liability by s8(1)) of the Education Act or whether it was immune by s2(1). In the event the school was not liable and the co -defendant was not the owner of the vehicle, the school could have commenced an action against the employer. 2)The second issue was the question of liability. The Education act provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the owner is not liable. The teacher's immunity only applies to the owner. The argument that the Education act is a general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way was rejected. The second issue on appeal was whether Edith was immune as a teacher from liability under s8 of the Health and Safety Act because she was the teacher within the meaning of s228. The school board could not find in favour of the board. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provided that a teacher is only liable if the teacher had acted within the scope of s8. The only person liable for the injury was the school teacher. The evidence was that the teacher was immune under s2 of the Act. The facts were that the co'sdefendant had immunity under s.86(1 of the HTSA for the motor vehicle accident. The School Board was not entitled to sue the employer for negligence. 4)The question of whether Ed was immune was whether applied to the co.defendant's liability under the EducationAct or not. The board was ordered to consider Thompson v. Board of Education, 1967 CanLII 430 (SK QB), 60 W.W.R. 513 (Sask. C.A.)."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). The plaintiffs alleged that a fire had occurred at the defendants' work site. The defendants sought to know whether any of the plaintiffs' witnesses had been retained by the defendants prior to the fire, and whether so, if so, who those witnesses were and how many times they had been there. The plaintiffs argued that names of possible expert witnesses were not discoverable. Objection No. 6-P. 297, Line 3-25 questioned the credibility of the statements made by the plaintiffs and the reliability of the witnesses. The only thing that would be required is an expert opinion. The Court was unable to determine whether the statements were made by SPMC directly or indirectly, or through third parties. The plaintiff's objection was that the question asked was asking for the plaintiffs expert opinion on a burn pattern. The question was too vague to answer. The respondents were entitled to know what was observable on the wall where the Soprema was applied, whether the plaintiffs had been present prior to that time, and their position on the matter. Objections No. 7-P., P. 327 and P. 330 were dismissed. The court found that it was impossible for SPMCs to refuse to supply the plaintiffs with the facts they had identified. The issue of litigation privilege was raised in Hill v. Board of Education. The defendant's counsel gave an undertaking to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position. The judge ordered SPMc to supply all parts of the reports and statements which deal with facts relevant to the issues. The order could not stand. The Plaintiff was not required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim is statute-barred pursuant to s. 3(3.1) of the Liability and Proceedings Act. The Attorney General's submission that the 12 month time limitation period in s.3(3) is set aside by s.4(3)(1) is not advanced by the Attorney General.  2) The language of s.24(1) in the LAA is clear and its meaning unambiguous. It is plain and obvious that any claims arising from acts or omissions that predate May 14 1953 cannot succeed in this court under the Crown Liability & Proceedings Act or any other Act. 3) The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional tort of its officers and servants occurring prior to June 1953. Although Haines J. decided that a provincial court has no authority to entertain any claim against any person arising from an alleged incident occurring before May 14/ 1953, the Attorney general's decision is based on the narrower ground that this court has jurisdiction to entertain claims arising that occurred before the proclamation of the CrownLiability Act on May 14 or 1953. 4) The Attorney general makes no application to strike the plaintiff’s claim in negligence, breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty on the ground that it must be brought in another court. 5) The plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Crown pursuant to the Crown’ s.2(1)(d)(i) of The Liability Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents, they have failed to plead cause of actions that this Court has jurisdiction in respect to anything that occurred prior to that time."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married for twelve years and had been together for seven years. There were no children of the relationship. The only issue on this hearing was whether the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support was reasonable. The parties agreed all property had been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona was their joint responsibility. The respondent had recently relocated to Nova Scotia from Sweden and the court was satisfied that, even if a lump sum was ordered to ease the transition to self-sufficiency, it was not necessary to provide the respondent with the means and resources necessary to meet her standard of living. The court awarded lump sum support in the amount of $10,000."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent, who had been the subject of a number of court proceedings, had previously been charged with the same offence as the appellant in the divorce action. The applicant, who now faced the prospect of a divorce action, applied to have her legal representation represented by the respondent's lawyer. The lawyer initially objected to the applicant's cross-examination, claiming that she was overbilled. The Respondent successfully applied for an order discharging the applicant’s legal fees at a rate that exceeded the respondent’ s. 8 rate. The appellant argued that the retainer agreement represented a form of fair and reasonable taxation, and that, given the respondent had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime, it would not be appropriate to require the applicant to participate in such a proceeding. The trial judge, who represented herself at the taxation hearing, was unsuccessful in this application, and the applicant had to rely on the respondent to testify. The appellants’ cross- examination was also unsuccessful, as the respondent was not the only person present. The court found that the respondent, despite having been previously charged with similar offences, had been unable to identify the exact content of the emails referred to in the various legal accounts. The evidence presented by the applicant and the respondent in the taxation proceeding was not of the sort that would be advanced in this case, given that the appellant had either already received a copy of the email in question and was in the process of identifying which legal accounts were subject to the taxation proceedings and, therefore, should not be required to participate."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of The Controlled Drugs & Substances act; and trafficking in marijuana contrary to ss. 5 (1) and 5(2) of Controlled Drugsand Substances. The Crown appealed the sentences. HELD: The sentences were reduced to 30 months imprisonment, 5 months less a day in the community, plus 10 years fire arms protection. 1) The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated 24/7, seven days per week. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. 2) The offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. The maximum sentence for trafficking in crack cocaine, which included crack cocaine and cocaine, was 18 months concurrent for each of the last two counts, to 1 year in the Community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts and a 10year fire arms ban.  3) The sentences imposed were not in relation to the three offences but rather to the common sense principles established in R. v. Patryluk, 2002 SKCA 33 (CanLII), and especially paragraphs 21-23. Considerations of parity alone would have warranted a sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case. The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, in light of the seriousness of the offences, even after taking into account the mitigating factors of the offenders."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit against the defendants, alleging that their facilities emitted lead, arsenic, PAH's and other toxins. They also sought certification under s. 7(1) of the certification order. The defendants had not filed notice of defence until 45 days after the certification ordered was issued. They then brought a motion for stay, arguing that this would cause them an additional $373,400 in litigation expenses. Motion for stay dismissed; the parties and the court approached the certification issue as addressing an amendment to the original Motion, not a replacement for the motion which had been presented at the earlier sessions. There is no evidence that this amendment would cause any damage to the plaintiffs' property or cause them any harm. The proposed settlement amount and settlement amount for the plaintiffs are $373k. There are two elements that raise the issue of irreparable harm: 1) there is a likelihood that the plaintiffs would not be in position to pay for the costs of the litigation leading up to the common issues trial in circumstances where the common issue may change significantly. The 2) there are some issues that are arguable on their face. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court. Neither the province nor the plaintiffs have established its fourth assumption, namely that there will be only one Notice published after the Court of Appeal's decision. There has been no evidence how that will affect the parties' marginal expense of conducting discovery. There will be no evidence on the fine points of the Province's submissions or the respondents' reply. There was no evidence of the pre-judgment costs."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the discovery subpoena was an improper use of discovery subpoenae and that the plaintiff had made an improper decision in seeking to exclude its representative from the discovery process. The plaintiff sought to increase the tariff for party/party costs by $500 as it felt the subpoenas were an abuse of process. Further, the defendant argued there were no special circumstances that would justify an increase in the tariff. HELD: The motion to increase costs was allowed. The court found the circumstances and factual findings justified an increase of the tariff, for party and party costs in a limited amount. 1)The use of subpoenas in this matter should be frowned upon. The Court's dissatisfaction should be expressed. 2)The issuing of the subpoena in this case was an abuse in process. 3)The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held, and in particular the order in which the parties would be discovered, became entrenched. The case law is applicable in that corporate defendant has a right to be represented at discovery. 4)The issuance of discovery subpoena in the amount of $750 was in keeping with the length of the hearing. The parties should have made a motion in July, as that was when the discovery was first held and the demand for discovery increased. The issuance of these subpoenas was therefore improper in that it caused the delay in time and confusion among the parties. The decision to award party/client costs in the range of $1,000 to $1k was also improper in the circumstances."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown had previously applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. HELD: The Court found that the offender is a high risk to re-offend violently and that, therefore, his risk to do so is high. The court found that if he continues to deny his culpability and sabotage his attendance in programming, his Risk to reoffend violent violently will continue to be high. It is an absolute necessity that he makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in the order for his trial and had not made any attempt to obtain financing. He applied for court appointed counsel. The application for court- appointed counsel was dismissed. The accused now applies in this Court for court appointees. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The accused has not met the second criterion for court appointment. He does not meet the third criterion. He has not made significant efforts to obtain the necessary financial resources for the defence nor has he demonstrated the necessary flexibility to make arrangements with counsel. 2) There is a significant difference between possession and possession of substances for the purposes of trafficking and the accused's ability to obtain and use them for the purpose of defence. The information and material presented by the Court in Rowbotham lead the Court to conclude that the accused is not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The Court of Appeal noted that R. v. Rowbothamp set forth protocol for an accused to pursue in seeking court appointed legal counsel in cases not falling within the provincial Legal Aid plan. The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority. Only in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as counsel for an individual is the court required to consider whether the court itself should make an order appointing counsel. In this case, the Court of Review was satisfied that the indigent is probably not capable to conduct his own own defence."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two children. Both parties have two children, the children reside with the respondent and he is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. The respondent has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children. HELD: The application to vary child support was granted and the respondent's application to extinguISH arrearages was dismissed. The final order for child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be a material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support order. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes a material, material change and for voluntary change to be reasonable in the circumstances. The father's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary the existing order. Accordingly the application to add child support by the respondent is dismissed."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal was reviewed and the errors that led to the granting of a remedy to the appellant were in accord with s. 45(3) of the Act. The Tribunal did not err in any respects and that the errors led to a granting of the appellant's remedy to him, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges. The evidence from the Board and Tribunal was that all of the possible treatment options were reviewed with the respondent, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. The respondent had various Bylaws, including the one relating to the patient's right to a termination of her privileges. This decision was based on the respondent's own evidence and was not made lightly."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties apply for partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. They also claim that the proceeds from the sale are over and above the contributions of the others. HELD: 1) The Court has a discretion to refuse partition under s. and s. 4. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons for the enrichment. The Court's Discretion Under the Act is limited to refusing partition under the s. because it is not reasonable to expect the parties to realize their capital value. The application will have to go to s. 6. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances.  3) If owners holding 'One Moiety (a half interest) or more' request partition and a partition and Sale s. directs that the court shall, unless it seems good reason to the contrary, direct Sale of the property whereas if the owners requesting the relief hold less than half interest it is S. that operates. The discretion to deny recovery may be made in light of the fact that the order would cause inconvenience and hardship to the defendant would not be sufficient reason to refuse the relief sought. 4) If the parties agree to a partition or sale, the Court may make all necessary or proper consequential directions which may include, where one of the owners gives an undertaking to purchase the interest of the party requesting sale, valuation of theproperty. The court will also take all necessary and proper steps to ensure that the remedy of constructive trust will be granted. 5) The application is allowed as long as it is governed by s. 2.

The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,The appellant plead guilty to the charge of slapping and striking an eight year old girl contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: Appeal allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent imprisonment substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to him. The title was encumbered by caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. The plaintiff took legal advice and advised that since he had an unencumbered fee simple Title he need not recognize the contractual reservation. He took legal action and was advised that he could avoid the reservation by staying put and claiming the money instead of the defendants because he had signed a 'bona fide' agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. 1)The land was at risk of falling into the hands of various types of purchasers. The possibility of a merger between the option and the title had not been considered by the parties as a serious issue. 2)The plaintiff had been denied his right to sue for damages because he alleged the defendants had interfered with his right of equitable access. 3)The option was exercisable and a fees simple title issued to the plaintiff. The claim that the defendants were entitled to rental income continued to run on the basis of the agreement which protected the surface lease rentals. 4)The court was not called upon to intervene to protect the rights of the 'bonam fide purchaser' (the owner of the unencencumbered title)."

The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.

If it was the intention of the director that heeded, it may do so. The board was directed to take appropriate steps. 1)The director was to take steps to prevent the applicant from further moves through the municipality. 2)The applicant was not directed to close the business or to make any further moves by the director. 3)The court had the power to make changes in the corporation's affairs so as to resolve the problem."

Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the shares. The numbered company had been a profitable operation for him. He had spent four years in the business repairing and maintaining it. He was only able to establish his loss in the middle of a range, which was the difference between the price paid and the market value of the shares at the time of the purchase. The trial judge found that the trial judge had not considered the true financial condition of the company, which had serious problems with the business. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to $1,700,000, which should be added to the balance of the buy price of $10,000. The award of consequential damages was not the correct test. It was the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty. The test for assessing direct damages was to be more stringent than that given by the trial judges. The Court was able to peg the loss in a range of $1 to $2,000 depending on the amount of the loan and the bank guarantee. The court could not decide between the direct and consequential damages."

The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant and at the time of the accident the couple's mortgage loans fell into default. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the husband received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The Bank refused to give an assignment to Equifax and the Royal Bank insisted that Equifax eliminate any references to the husband's default or delinquency upon the loans. This was not acceptable to the wife with the result that she refused to pay her loans. The husband commenced this legal action for payment. The wife's counter-claim against the Royal bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages was admitted. The court concluded that the Royal had acted fairly and reasonably throughout and that it had 'done its bit' to release the loans to Equafine. The plaintiff also brought an action against the defendant for breach of its duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by amendment application made at trial and allowed by this judgment. HELD: The Royal's claim against the Bank was dismissed in total. 1)The plaintiff had expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. By the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement he authorized the Royal to release to Equifine the information which it did.

The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of his vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. She determined that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant's present poor health, and that the automobile accident caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000 as general damages is excessive and should be reduced. At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial court that the appellant suffered pain in his neck and back for relatively short period of time as result of the 1992 accident, which because of his already existing condition may have caused him more pain and anxiety than it would to person without an existing back problem; and, ultimately, to attribute a larger percentage of the appellant’s present health problems to the accident in question, with a correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. HELD: The appeal and cross appeal were both dismissed with costs to the court to the same extent. There was ample medical evidence to support the trial judges’ conclusion that the crash did not have a material effect to the respondent’ s present medical problems and there was no basis, in law, upon which we can interfere with that conclusion. The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the cross appeal. There would be no order for costs.  1)The appeal and appeal were dismissed with cost to the trial Judge. The cross appeal and the appeal and/or appeal were also dismissed. 2)The appellant was essentially asking the court that he set aside the trial judgment’S credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the trial officer, and, Ultimately, toattribute larger percentage than a portion of the respondent's present health problem to the incident in question (the accident in itself). There was plenty medical evidence, to support that the incident did not directly contribute to the present medical problem, and there is no basis in law upon which to interfere with it. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case."
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old, who was charged with manslaughter in the death of the man who had been robbed of drugs, and her friend who was not identified attacked and choked the man in the basement suite where she was staying with him and threatened to stab him with a tire iron.

The sentence was set aside and a sentence of five years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. The court gave the respondent a credit for four months' imprisonment served on appeal."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","The testator left all of his property to his children, except for his jewellry and personal clothing, to be sold. His will was admitted to probate in 2002. The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child, rather than make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift. There was some evidence that from time to time he made attempts to make changes in his will, but these were not properly executed and witnessed.

d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. They have lived separate and apart for more than a year. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003.

The parties were separated for more then a year prior to the divorce proceeding. The issues were: 1) spousal support; 2) the husband's failure to provide the wife with an auto; and 3) the wife's allegation that the man had failed to comply with the Separation agreement requiring her to provide him with an expensive automobile. HELD: 1). The husband was entitled to spousals support retroactive to the date he ceased paying it; retroactive payments of $1,000 per month for a period of fifteen months unless, prior to this termination date, the applicant commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousa should continue.  2) Although the wife had established an entitlement to spOUSAL support at separation, the evidence supports a conclusion it was only for a year's duration. There were disadvantages related to its breakdown, which were not established by the marriage. The Court concluded that the wife was entitled, albeit temporarily, to spouse her through the marriage, and that her financial needs and needs required such support. 3) The obligation to pay spousousal supported as outlined in the Agreement was clearly reviewable by the parties.

The quantity was substantial and it was not surprising that both had clear recollection of the event. The contract was in force from the time the telephone conversation ended on June 25, 2001. Had the price dropped, the plaintiff would have suffered a loss of $36.50 per tonn which is the loss of profit on which the plaintiff's claim is based multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43.

The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The defendant denied that the plaintiff loaned money to the plaintiff and her husband, into the auto broking business known as Auto Brokers 1999 (E M). The claim goes on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amounts of $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendants deny that the transaction was a loan and that the plaintiffs husband ever made any money from his estate. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not made with the knowledge of the defendant and only with the testimony of the plaintiff. The evidence of the cross-examination by the husband reveals that the wife did not have the business name of the company registered with Saskatchewan Justice and that she did not make the decision on her own. The husband's evidence that the husband made a similar decision in 1999 to buy another vehicle also failed to prove the loan. The Court finds that the defendant had a business name registered with SJS and that it was not a loan to either. The wife has stated that she made the decision to pay as she did on the basis of the evidence presented in cross- examination. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was loan to the defendant was that the employee of one of the defendants' companies and she wrote a cheque for $69,000 to the husband.

HELD: 1) The testator was deceased. He had no children. The deceased testatory made a will appointing his brother as his executor and sole beneficiary. In the event that the testatory failed to outlive the testor, she was to be the executrix of his estate and sole beneficiaries.  2) The applicant was the test's sister. She deposed that she had been involved in the testators life and that she worried that the testsator was being influenced by the blind. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, it was not necessary to have viva voce evidence of Violet Beaudry on this application.  3) The court recognized the difficulty of proving coercion which is part of undue influence and recognized the legitimacy of drawing inferences of undue undue influence from suspicious circumstances. It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses. 4) It is not necessary for the Court to determine whether the testatories' last will was subjected to undue influence. The testatory was found to have exceeded the influence of the blind in his life. The court ordered a trial to prove the testatorial's last will in solemn Form. The issue of undue influences cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. It was necessary so that the matter can properly be assessed by the Court."

Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The respondent parents applied to have the custody of the child returned to their original care in Alberta under a temporary guardianship order. The child was apprehended by child welfare authorities in 2005 and returned to her birth parents but again apprehended by the child welfare officials. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted. The respondent parents temporarily re-located to Calgary and put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents. In March 2007, the appellant appealed that order and was notified that her application to adopt had been granted. In May 2007, both the appellant and the respondent birth parents applied for access.

The evidence of the appellant's attempts to be represented at the hearing is reasonably capable of belief; the steps she took to secure counsel were reasonable in the circumstances and that she acted with dispatch. 2)The court would admit fresh evidence limited to the portions of the the appellant’s affidavit addressing her efforts to secure the birth parent’ and the father’ s.7 and 8 affidavits. 3)The respondent’d been granted custody of their child.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of a Child and Family Services judge sitting on appeal from an order in relation to the child K.W. who had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. When it was returned to the father, the minister sought to adduce fresh evidence in relation the fitness of the father. The matter came back before the Minister on appeal under s. 63(4)(c) and 37(5)(a) of which the judge made an order pursuant the order pursuant that the child be returned to his father, subject to conditions (see s.37(1)(a)). This order was fraught with ambiguity for it is unclear whether, during the transition period, the child retains status as parent until the transition is complete and the child is returned tohis father's care, and if so, who determines when the transition begins. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The child was apprehended at Birth due to drug abuse. When he was approximately 12 months old the minister requested a permanent custody order pursuantto s. 36(1(a)). The order was clearly provided for a supervision period of only 1 year after the child resumed custody of K.L. Section 27 applies to protection hearings. While the judge on appeal had jurisdiction to make an order subject to condition (see S.63(4)). This power is not 'broad enough' to permit the judge to make a order that both returns the child to the custody of parent, pursuant to S.37 and has the child remain in the custody thereof, pursuant only to s.(1)(b). This period is subject to a number of conditions reflecting the recommendations in the psychological report and is not material to this application. 2)The application was also dismissed."

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was paying $28,889.75 per month for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident as per s. 117 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The respondent argued that the IRB for the 180 day period was less than the IRIB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. HELD: The respondent's IRB was calculated using the weighted average approach used by SGI in calculating the IRBs for the post 180 day periods. The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBT for both the first and subsequent day periods to the appellant. Counsel for the appellant appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to the respondent on the basis of pre-judgment interest.

He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The defendant company moved to interlocutory injunction in response to a 30 year non-compete agreement signed by one of its former employees. The agreement was effective March 5, 2012. Since the agreement was not renewed for another 30 year, the applicant company had not had sufficient time to gather all of the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutorutory motion. The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction. Application to stay the injunction granted; stay granted in the event of a declaration of emergency by the judge. Although the proposed location was near a drug store, it would be in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 people. This would be a huge change for the applicant business, which was already facing a huge loss of business. The applicant company was facing a serious threat to its business and had made a motion to have the injunction stayed. The court looked at the circumstances in determining whether to issue an order for an interlutory injunction, and whether they should consider the more demanding standard put forward by the defendant in an injunction application."
d_2012skqb513.txt,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","Civil Procedure – JudgmentSaskatchewan Government Insurance granted judgment in Lakeland Towing, operating sole proprietorship under the name of Lakeland Township.

d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","The trial judge found the plaintiff had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam and awarded damages for repair and other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ple beam notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete grade beam was not established at trial. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and the trial judge did not err in the admission of expert evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1)The trial Judge made no evidential or overriding error in the calculation as to damages. The evidence of the damaged tripleply beam was sufficiently advanced to lead the trial court to conclude that the trial Judge was biased. The appellant's evidence concerning the rotten triple-pence beam and its estimate as to how long the structural problem had existed did not rise to the level necessary to establish reasonable apprehension of bias. The verdict of guilty as charged was found to be in breach of s. 14 of the Act.  2)The court found no palpable or overriding errors in the trial law. The standard of review in respect to appeals brought under s. 39 of The Small Claims Act was dealt with in the case of Kitzul v. Ungar (1991), [1991] SCC 45. Harker v. Rieger, [2003] S.C.R. 334, [4th) 1) was a case of trial unfairness in the civil context. The court reviewed the role of an appellate court which would also apply to the appeal. It is not the role for appellate courts to second guess the weight to be assigned to the various items of evidence. If there is no palpable, overriding error with respect the underlying facts that the judge relies on to draw the inference, it is only where the inference-drawing process itself is palpably in error that an appellate Court can interfere with the factual conclusion."

Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This was an application by a non-practising psychologist to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from Queen'sBench to this court; the Psychologists act does not provide that right; the Court determined that the Psychologist Act does. The psychologists Act and its predecessors, dating back to The Psychologist act, and their predecessors, which deal with an appeal of a decision by the College of Psychologists to the Court, only tangentially concern the question of when a right of appeal lies from a verdict of the Queen's bench to this courtroom.

The Psychologyologists Act doesn't state that no appeal lies with this Court from a Queen'sbench decision; nor does the Psychology Act provide that a right to appeals from the Court to Queen's- Bench only. The Psychiatricologists Act only tangential concern the issue of when right of appeals lies from the decision of Queen’s Bench to this case.

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.",HELD: The court found that the defendant was guilty of defamation as long as he was in the know about the facts and did what he was told. The court did not find that the defendants were liable in defamation as the article published in the Star Phoenix was part of a series of fair and accurate contemporaneous reporting by the defendants that were the basis of the defendants' defamation claim. The defendants opposed the application to add the defendant as a defendant on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired. The plaintiff had already commenced a lawsuit against the defendants alleging that they had published defamatory comments about the defendant. The defendant was aware of the existence of the claim in the Sun and the StarPhoenix and he had been in contact with the plaintiffs' counsel prior to the publication of these articles. The issues were whether the statement of claim should be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as a sidekick to the defendants and whether the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control.

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property and custody, including custody, of the two youngest children, under the Infants Act and maintenance for the three other children. The parties lived in the USA in 1977 and '1977'. The respondent had a job operating a backhoe. In 1977, he bought a motor vehicle and other assets, which he used to service the Matrimonial home. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching equipment was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. The respondent spent heavily on alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have. He was in arrears of maintenance for his two younger children. This was all to be paid for by the parties. The father was in good health and did not miss work due to alcohol. The mother was in charge of the family finances and the finances from 1977 to 1981. The court found that the respondent, who had spent much of the money trenching, abused alcohol and wasted money on booze. He had lost his licence and did some work as a seasonal worker. This had little left. The money was spent on the family and lost in the trenching business. The applicant was entitled to keep his 1977 Mercury motor vehicle, his tools and some of his tools, plus some of the respondent's tools. He also was entitled, for the purposes of the exhibit of his property, to have her name in his possession as his own."

The trial judge also accepted the evidence of a police officer who testified that he was hearing the appellant's speech as being different from the norm and that his pupils had dilated. The Crown appealed the conviction arguing that the trial Judge had er erred law in that she did not direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof in a criminal case.

e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

The respondent's proposed alternative proposal was that the matrimonial home be sold and the proceeds be divided equally. The parties lived in the matonial home until September 1995 when it was sold and he took leave of absence from his employment with the Provincial Government. The petitioner applied for an order listing the home for sale and for a pre-trial conference which was to proceed in January 1996. The basis for this application was that in September 1995 the respondent took leave from his job to sell the matrononial home and in the meantime he was considering a further order for spousals and child maintenance. HELD: 1)The matrimony was not an extraordinary circumstance and it would be unfair and inequitable to the petitioner as custodial parent to orderan equal division of the matrionial home. 2)The petitioner was awarded judgment for divorce.  3)The respondent was ordered to pay spousa and child back in September 1996 as his share of the Matrimonial home was to be deducted from his share.  4)The parties were to have joint custody of their children for 3 years. 5)The applicant was to apply for an Order for Divorce which would have ordered an equal division between the spouses.

Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP.

Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.

The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT.

The amendment could only be considered pursuant to an application under s. 44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act as amended. HELD: The application was allowed. On the basis of the foregoing the defendant was not successful. As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments. The limitation period in s. 314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The plaintiff was a joint owner of the property and should have been included as a plaintiff at the original action.

The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.

The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent's income was reduced from $42,386.34 to $54,800. He requested that the amount of child support varied so that access could be varied so as to provide for access every Saturday evening. The petitioner argued that this change in circumstances did not constitute material change in the respondent's circumstances. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)Once a material change becomes apparent, the question becomes whether there has been any material change. The evidence in this regard suggests that there has not been. 2)Once the question of material change is posed, the application is dismissed with Costs."

The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions.

The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.

e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects.

The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge were in dispute. The issues were whether the plaintiff's actions amounted to obstruction and whether the police had to arrest the plaintiff bearing in mind the provisions of s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code and whether it was necessary to arrest this person bearing in consequence of the provisions thereof. HELD: The plaintiff's action was found to amount to obstruction. Although the plaintiff had been restrained and restrained by the police, the action was not necessary to the arrestant. The action taken by the defendant was found not to amount in obstruction. 1) The plaintiff had not been properly restrained. The defendant's actions did not amount to interference with the police. The confrontation with the plaintiff was an accident which resulted from the plaintiff struggling and the forward force from both of us onto the hood of the car. The arrest was necessary because the plaintiff put himself in the path of the police officers. 2) The actions by the plaintiff were found to be in breach of the terms of the Agreement. The agreement between the parties was that the plaintiff should not have been arrested but rather had his actions be taken into account. The fact that the agreement was not signed by the parties and the plaintiff did not change the fact that he was not the only person in the lounge affected the agreement."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants made an order in February 2005 directing that the plaintiff and the defendants supply the defendants with an order providing an accounting for all funds received from, held on behalf of, and invested on behalfof Margaret Fehr. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant had failed to present reasonable grounds for believing that the corporation was or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or otherwise, and therefore, there was no basis for the defendants' application for summary judgment. The plaintiff also sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 129 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's motion did not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the corporate defendant was not making payment to redeem shares in essence but rather, following judgment however and whenever it would be necessary to be paid to other shareholders who have right to be compensated, including execution, rateably with or in priority to the plaintiff. 2)The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 did not represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129. 3)There was no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant's corporation. The realizable value of the assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and the amount that would be required to be pay to other holders who have the right to pay on redemption or in liquidation, rateable with or without priority to that plaintiff. 4)The affidavit of the affidavit filed by the defendant in July 2004 was the only affidavit filed on its own. The defendant did not specifically depose that there was a defence to the action on the merits, that is the fair interpretation to be placed on the overall tenor of the affidavits. 5)The cross-examination of the defendant on his affidavit in August 2005 was not the basis for making the application for leave to amend the statement. The affidavit was also not a photocopy of the original cheque. 6)The Court was of the view that s.34(2) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place"

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The defendant contested such instructions and, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. 1)The defendant was not the cause or source of the damage. She was the legal representative of the plaintiff and her daughter. She did not provide clear instructions to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. She clearly indicated that the request for final billing was for final- billing. This misunderstanding cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the defendant. 2)The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs to the defendant to be determined."

As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The defendant farmer cut down some trees on his property. The farmer was a friend of the defendant farmer and was allegedly doing so to help him deal with a septic field problem. The farmers were concerned that the defendant, who had worked in forestry all of his life, might be involved in a joint enterprise. The defendant farmer offered to pay the plaintiff back for the trees he had cut down, but the plaintiff was not prepared to pay for the work himself. The plaintiff sued for general damages, claiming that the defendants were negligent in letting the trees fall and that they were not able to provide the plaintiff with the assistance they needed to mitigate the damages. The defendants appealed. Dismissing the claim and awarding damages against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,750 for tree replacement and $2,000 for tree removal, for a total of $5,750. The plaintiffs were not content to limit their recovery to the defendant as they feared he would not have assets to satisfy judgment. The court found that the enterprise was itself unlawful, and there was no reasonable foreseeability that the plaintiff would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached. The claimants were allowed their costs in the amounts of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $6,750 as against the defendant Renouf, in the sum of $4,750 to be awarded to the plaintiff for tree maintenance and $1 million for repairs to the defendants' septicfield."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendant.

e_2011skqb467.txt,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented by the defendant, who was senior and more experienced in the trade, and he violently assaulted her. The defendant was at large on his recognizance entered into before a Justice or a Judge and being bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with the F.M., except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan, but that he had not been arrested as he was drinking wildly. The two accounts diverged markedly when the defendant explained his version of what happened in the Hotel room, and the complainant alleged that he telephoned her and threatened to kill her. Defendant found guilty of unlawful confinement. The evidence showed that the defendant had punched the complainant several times in the face and had physically prevented her from doing so each time. The Court found that the Crown had proven each required element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt and that the accused was guilty of both charges. Sexual assault was found to be the most aggravating element. The allegation that the complainant attempted to flee from the hotel when the confrontation began was rejected. The defence had established that the first complainant had been the driving force behind the cocaine purchase and that at some point the defendant grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards him. The second complainant alleged the defendant punched her in the crotch and crotch and that after the assault she had grabbed his testicles in defence and had to be forcibly restrained. The accused denied these allegations and said that he did not intend to cause death to the complainant. HELD: The defendant is guilty of all charges. The elements required for self-defence are not present. The only issue which was raised was whether the accused had proven the offence of unlawful imprisonment beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt. The Crown has proven each requirement of the act beyond areasonable doubt and the accused is guilty."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim with his penis, moved around in a manner that offended the victim's sensibilities and caused pain to her legs and buttocks. The accused was also found to have had a motive to lie and had acted in a sexual manner towards the victim. The victim did not know the accused's true identity and did not recognize him as her biological father. The Court concluded that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence was committed. The court considered the following aspects of the witnesses testimony: 1) the attitude and demeanor of the witness; 2) the integrity of the evidence; 3) the internal consistency of the testimony; 4) the importance of the law in assessing whether the accused has motive to lies or conspiracy; 5) the passage of time since the event occurred (the accused only became aware in May 2009 that he was not in fact her biological dad; 6) the essential elements of sexual offence were comprehensively addressed by the SCC in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCC. HELD: The accused is guilty of four counts. The essential elements are: 1). the accused was a common-law partner; 2] the accused had a common interest in the victim and his family; 3), the accused communicated with the victim about his sexual activities and the substantial and unjustified risk that the victim would receive from touching the victim such that it ended the alleged incidents once and for all; 4)'s conduct was beyond reasonable doubt and beyond reasonable suspicion; the accused intended the victim to receive a communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct of which the accused is alleged to have intended to have the victim receive such a communication. The relationship between the accused and the victim was one of mutual trust and respect. The offence of touching the child was not proven until the age of 16 years. The evidence of the accused corroborated the allegation that the child had touched the accused. The fact that the alleged child had not been sexually assaulted by the accused in any way during the alleged incident was not a factor in this case."

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Criminal Code, including operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Criminal Code s.253(1)(a)) contrary to s.255(1) and driving while disqualified (C.253)(4)). The issue before the court was whether the accused was pedaling his bike as his sole means of propulsion and whether the electric engine was operable. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges of impaired driving and driving with a revoked or suspended licence. The issue was whether there were pedals on the accused's bike. The accused had stated on his web site that he was not driving a motor car as defined by the Code and therefore was not obligated to acquit him. The defence took the position that the accused should be acquitted of the impaired driving charge and the offence of driving while disqualifying. The offence of impaired causing was not defined in the Criminal code s.254(3)(a) as there was no evidence before the Court regarding the status of the accused’s driver’ s licence. HOLD: The offence was impaired driving. The officer was acquitted of both charges. The Crown had failed to prove that the Rookes bike was a motor motor vehicle as defined in s. 253(1(a)) of the Code. The Court was unable to decide whether the Rooks’ bike was motor vehicle or whether the Electric Motor Vehicle was operABLE. The only defence witness was witness to the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped. The police officer testified that he observed the accused pedaling the bike with both of his feet being close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the electric motor powered the bike."

The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had been drinking and the two victims stayed at the accused's residence while he was in the process of driving. The victims, J.M. and D.H., left the residence after hearing the accused speak to them about sex. The two women later returned to the accused’s residence and found him guilty of sexual interference contrary to ss. 151 and 151. The Court of Appeal gave a conditional sentence of 30 months incarceration to the first offender, with a suspended sentence of 12 months and a probation order of 30 days. The second offender was found not guilty of the sexual assault charge because his record was not set out in a general report. The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Statement of Interest – Sale of PropertyCivil Procedure The sole issue on appeal is whether the Phillips law firm should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. The sole issues on appeal are whether the Holgates and their lawyer breached their obligations to act as solicitor for the plaintiffs. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the Holgins had a'reasonable person' as their lawyer. The Court was of the view that the relationship between the Holgs and the plaintiffs was one dimension of the solicitor-client relationship and it was clear that the parties had discussed the terms of the agreement, their position in the market and their current position in government. 2) The Holgaters and their lawyers met under the impression that their law firm acted for both sides. This was not the case. The Holgins and their legal counsel first broached the conflict of interests with the plaintiff in early July 2013. Their application followed on August 13th when a negotiated approach failed. Simply put, there was no delay."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over.08. He was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the conviction of impaired driving. The accused argued his rights under ss. and of the Charter were violated because there were not sufficient objective grounds for the officer's suspicion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact. There is no basis for disturbing this finding of facts. 2)The accused's rights under s. and s. 24(2) of the charter were violated. The trial judge based his suspicion on three facts: the accused had been drinking that evening; the accused was not drinking any alcohol; the trial judge correctly did not take into account the absence of any other signs that the appellant had been recently drinking; the appellant's nervousness, his lack of desire to tell the officer what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning. The appellant had no problems walking or standing at the roadside. 3)The defence argued that the trial court erred in finding there were insufficient reasonable grounds for a reasonable suspicion to make an approved screening device demand on the accused. The defence argued the trial trial judge erred when he concluded that the ASD demand was not reasonable and there being no other reason for detaining the accused, there was a violation of the appellant s.and s.4(2)(b) of their Charter rights. The appeal court was of the view that the officer had reasonable suspicion as he based his demand on three of the three facts. The reasonableness of the officer’s suspicion was based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer that he was aware of prior to making the ASD request. The ASD demand had not been based on reasonable suspicion and there were no other physical manifestations such as slurring or coordination issues that were observed after the demand had been made. The Court found that when the officer asked the accused if he had any alcohol that evening, the accused stated he had drank three beer. The Certificate of Qualified Technician was subsequently served on the appellant. The respondent had no problem walking or sitting at the side of the street.  4)The appeal court concluded that there was no reasonable grounds to make the ASD call. The evidence was reliable, relevant and necessary for the Crown’ s.5 and s"
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the judicial sale was granted. The reserve bid was set at $100,000. There were concerns that the application for a judicial sales may be set at any time during the proceeding. The court ordered that the proposed selling officer be appointed selling officer. The proposed selling Officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel. The setting of the reserve bid in a judicial sell is a requirement of s. 10-47(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules. The order nis for judicial sales was granted nisi in support of its application. The realtor is permitted to reduce the list price to the amountof the reserve b bid without further direction from the court; it would be more fair to set the reserve bidder at an amount closer to $125,000 than is appropriate."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent member of the Regina City Police Service who pushed and punched the victim of a sexual assault while he was in the process of resisting arrest. The trial judge concluded that the trial judge erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Crown appealed to Queen's Bench as a summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was entered in the Provincial Court. The verdict of guilty was set aside and the Crown appealed back to Queen’s Bench as part of s. 29 of the Code. 1) The trial Judge erred by failing to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the respondent’d been subjectively believed that his use of force was reasonable. The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1) and 34(1), and found that the jurisy that resulted in the errors was found to be fundamentally flawed. The court found that in assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the trial Judge also failed to take in account certain of the factors in the analysis of the proportionals and measure the force used. This is a significant issue in determining whether the officer was reasonably justified in kicking the victim in the abdomen as he was not expecting the victim to fall backwards and the force he used was not reasonable in all the circumstances.  2) The Court found that it was open to the Crown to determine whether the trial court erred when it concluded that respondent had used more force than was necessary to either defend himself under s. 34(2) of the code or effect the arrest of the victim under s25(1)."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend the children. The accused kicked the complainant and hit her. The defence argued that the accused had no authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment and that she was subjected to an unlawful and unreasonable search and seizure and infringed her rights contrary to section 13.1. HELD: The child protection worker was not acting in a manner that established that the children in need or in the circumstances were in the best interests of the children and therefore, in need and therefore in needof protection. The evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the accused’s suite was excluded. 1) The child worker did not have any lawful authority to allow the police to enter or detain the children nor to search the apartment. The fact that a worker had directed that the officer was not to have any contact with the children does not alter that situation. 2) The totality of the evidence was to the effect that the child protection officer was an officer appointed by the Child and Family Services Act, and as such had certain powers under that Act. The child protect worker did have reasonable grounds to believe that the father had contact with her and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with Ms.Bigsky. The most fundamental question is, what is the status of a simple directive from the childprotection worker, when no order is made, when there is no order made, and the Court cannot conclude that the Court is satisfied that the law and the manner in which the child is dealt with in this situation has been violated. The simple directive cannot have the same force of law as a court order. The protection worker was not in breach of the Children and Family SERVICES Act or any other legal authority. The mere fact that the worker had given her consent to enter her apartment suite does not establish that the Children were inNeed of protection or apprehension was warranted. 3) The fact the worker directed that officer not to contact the children or to allow them in does not change the situation. The worker communicated to the children that she had a right to enter their apartment suite and that they were to enter it and search for the children, and that the police officer was to assist her with the apprehension of the child. 4) The evidence was"
e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The court found that the accused had reasonable suspicion as to her level of impairment. The delay in obtaining the sample was unreasonable. The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the ASD demand, which would result in a Charter breach. The reasonable suspicion standard may be law, but it requires something more than mere hunch. The defence's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some 30-35 minutes after the accused was arrested was not satisfactory. The reason for the delay was that the police officer did not leave the station until some 35 minutes later. This delay prejudiced the accused."
