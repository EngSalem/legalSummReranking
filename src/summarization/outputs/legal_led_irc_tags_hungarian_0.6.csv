Warrant issued to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The affidavit in support referred to an unknown informant. Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The information sworn in support of the application for the search warrant failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search.  2)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the warrant.  3)The Information was deficient in the following respects: (a)Reliable and confidential information was received that the weapons used in the attempted Armed Robbery were in the dwelling house and (b) anything that there is reasonable ground to believe will afford evidence with respect to the commission of an offence against this Act, or (d)the grounds of belief set out in the information must be such as would satisfy a reasonable man.",3.142163452554014
"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","HELD: The Court dismissed the claim. The Court found that the plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and could not succeed on this ground. There was no evidence that the defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he retained by the plaintiffs or purporting in any way to act for them or on their behalf. There were two other issues raised in the claim together: Breach of Trust. The plaintiffs had raised an allegation of breach on the part of the defendant; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a 'fuitary relationship' with the plaintiff or was he ever retained by them or purposed in any manner to act in their behalf; and there was an allegation that the defendants were aware of possible fluctuation in the proceeds of mortgage advances and that they had not followed the instructions of his clients.",8.10383108983213
"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial of the Queen v. Joseph Glenn Jessome. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court held that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority. He had the right to exercise the discretion and to be wrong.  2)It was necessary to establish a jurisdictional error by the learned Provincial Court judge in the conduct of the s16(3) inquiry on the ground that the tribunal committed an error of law in reaching that decision, or reached a conclusion different from that which the reviewing tribunal might have reached.",5.477075639054646
"The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The accused pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest prior to receiving a disposition of six months open custody and two years probation. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge considered the accused's age, that he had no criminal record and co-operated extensively with the police. He also took into account the very responsible approach that his father has taken throughout this whole event. 2)The Court was aware that there might not have been any further custody other than what the accused had served over the last three months or so.",2.609249021027887
"The respondent owned a warehouse and leased it to the appellant's employer. During the course of her employment, a ceiling tile fell and struck the appellant. Both the respondent and the appellant's employer were employers under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appellant received benefits under the act. She commenced the action against the respondent with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The trial judge held the action barred pursuant to the act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 18 of the Act bars actions against any employer to which Part I of the Act applies. It is not necessary that the employer be the appellant's employer.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court which held that the action by the appellant was barred by s.18 of the Workers' Compensation Act. The appellant was employed by MacKenzies Eastern Transport Limited. She was struck by a tile which fell from the office ceiling. She received benefits under the Act. She commenced the present action against the respondent for damages with the consent of the workers' compensation board. HELD: Appeal dismissed without costs per oral reasons for judgment of Jones, J.A., Chipman and Roscoe, JJ.A. concurring.

"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside its default judgment on the basis that the defendant had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. The plaintiff had engaged Ontario counsel to apply for judgment in Nova Scotia, based on the default judgment in these proceedings, and for an order dismissing the Ontario action on the grounds of res judicata or abuse of process. On the hearing yesterday, the defendant applied pursuant to Rule 12.06 in the Court of Appeal for a stay of the action based on forum non conveniens. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).  1)There was no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade the court that in order to do justice between these parties, should exercise my discretion in favour of the defendant. 2)The defendant had not brought itself within the scope of the remarks of Chief Justice Cowan in Pinard and Pinard v. Bushell et al. (1975), nor did the court accept the appellant's submission that the deliberate decision not to attorn to the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia courts should not be regarded as a reasonable excuse. 3)The court found that there were triable issues between the parties and the defendant's application was not a mistake or an oversight. It was not an omission through inadvertence or insufficient time or other pressing business.",2.3704063102669775
"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","This was an appeal of a decision by the Chambers judge to strike out the employer's statement of claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The court has no jurisdiction regardless of the conclusion of the arbitrator on the question of arbitrability. The court has jurisdiction to determine whether matters addressed and governed by the collective agreement are arbitrable. 2)There is an issue as to whether the letter of July 22, 1994 is part of the Collective Agreement. The collective agreement contains an arbitration provision. It requires submission to arbitration of differences between them relating. to the interpretation, application and administration of the collective agreements. 3)There are several factual questions relevant to this issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25.",4.445243581389692
"The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible. The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleged that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. HELD: The applicant was granted leave to file a third party notice in the within action, in the form of an order for costs or an order setting out time schedule for the completion of certain steps in the action. The applicant applies to join the G[…] First Nation as a party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. 1)The applicant requires leave of this Court under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act, R.S. s. 1978, c. C-31, and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. The proposed third party claim on file and the other pleadings allege material facts that, if proven, would allow the applicant to obtain the relief it seeks from the proposed party. 2)There may well be some delay by allowing third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate and prejudice or delay should be alleviated by directions (whether they are in form of a letter or order) as opposed to a dismissal of the application. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third parties proceedings would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by either party in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's claim. 3)The application for leave under s7 of The Contributory negligence act and the rules of Court should be treated the same. To attain uniformity, it seems reasonable on an application for an order granting the applicant leave to apply for leave in this action to encourage the joinder of third parties thereby averting duplication in law suits, and to minimize delay and prejudice to the applicant.",2.876794984754164
"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agreed that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of the husband's income, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1)The parties agreed the child support payments would continue until such time as the children are no longer children within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2)The court ordered that the parties pay monthly child support of $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses, with such payments to continue on the first day of each and every month until the child, Keegan, is no longer a child of the marriage. 3)The Court ordered that there would be no variation of the arrears to the parties.

"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest. The Court held that because he is a'step-parent' to Trista, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application.  1) The Court considered a variety of factors, but not necessarily limited to: (a) the extent or degree of the relationship between the parties, (b) the level of intimacy and quality of relationship between them, (c) how the relationship was represented to the world, (d) whether the applicant provided financially for the child, and (e) if the respondent provided support to the child during the times that the child was in his or her care.  2) In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court should consider a range of factors including whether the respondent has demonstrated a settled intention to treat the child as his/her own and (f) whether there is a family or blood relationship that can be screened out through the application of s. of the Act.  3) The court reviewed the circumstances of the parties' relationship and found that they had developed a somewhat idyllic relationship. The relationship spanned years 2000 to 2007, commencing when Trista was barely a toddler. Over those years Lawrence provided care for her and was involved in activities with her and her two young children, who were conceived while she was separated from Lawrence.. The Court noted that in other circumstances, and for different purposes such as under The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, supra, applicants '... who do not have both a significant relationship with the child and demonstrated and settled ongoing commitment to this child' should generally be screened in the application. In this case, the court was satisfied that Lawrence had demonstrated that he was a Person of sufficient Interest with respect to the children.  4) It was at this stage of the inquiry that the Court was to determine whether or not access should be granted to the respondent.  5) The relationship, in one form or another, spanned a period of at least five years. Over the years Lawrence supported the family and provided child care when Melodie was working night shifts. The court was also to determine if there was a family member who could be said to have a'reasonable interest' in bringing this application.. 6) It would appear that the threshold for determining that a person has a'sufficiency interest' under the Act is lower than that for the Court",3.3013213180080303
"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT: The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support.

The respondent qualified for disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. Since the separation, the petitioner alone has provided for the children. In the circumstances, relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of child support. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that there was sufficient total means to enable the petitioner and the children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and the respondent to enjoy an improved standard.. The latter can be achieved by providing to the respondent some of the farm land which is rented out. The petitioner has de facto possession of the land and receives the entire rental.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1)The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused, and immediately took steps both to assist the accused and to have other officers attend at the scene. The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside the police vehicle constituted careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.  2)The Court of Queen's Bench test was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove without due notice and attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and if so, whether the accused exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The first part of the Sault Ste. Marie test is whether Mr. Tyndall has shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised due due diligence, or took reasonable care, on this date. Based on the evidence, and the findings of fact, the accused has shown that his vehicle was rolled forward a very short distance, and did not accelerate or move forward quickly before striking him. 3)The evidence of the Crown and the defence witnesses was that the officer was on duty in a marked police car, and he was aware that the vehicle was approaching a pedestrian crossing road adjacent to a parking lot, and while walking directly in front of the stopped vehicle, he was struck by that vehicle as it rolled forward into the accused. The Court found that the Crown could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close to him, and that the police officer did exercise due diligence and took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event. There was no evidence of discussions between the officer and the accused after the officer reversed his vehicle. 4)The court held that the driving by the accused was careless. It held that, given the situation, the prosecution need not prove state of mind, but it is open to the accused to prove due diligence defence. The Crown has proven that the offence under s.44(1), is careless.",5.949112528394887
"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.

"Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77 This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children. The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father.

(2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","This was a costs decision.

The respondent sought an award of costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff “A” of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff was reproduced following Rule 77. The court imputed an income level to the respondent that was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000) and assigned an additional half day of Court time to this aspect of the case. HELD: The costs award was to be based on a set of tariffs. The tariffs were to be set in accordance with the tariffs. There was no evidence that the respondent was the more successful party. Costs were assessed against the respondent based on the tariff. Costs of $2,000 were payable at rate of $150 per month until paid in full in December 2012. Costs awarded against the applicant were to vary the existing order from the one set out by the Court to the one that was set out in the Rules and the case law.",2.786943786037695
"FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. is a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries, Inc., while a corporation incorporated in Saskatchewan, was a corporation specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly has little or none assets in Saskatchewan. HELD: The court dismissed the motion. To make an award for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time. The court has the power to order security in all cases where it is thought. just to do so. There are appropriate circumstances to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security. For the purposes of this application, the court would be more inclined to enter into. meaningful settlement discussions as alleged. The question arises whether this Court has. jurisdiction to direct security in the present circumstances. It would be open to direct that security be. posted in either event against either or both of the plaintiffs. The Court is permitted to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure. by ordering security in. instances not covered by the rule. In this case, there are 'appropriate' circumstances. Per Grotsky J. in Thole v. McKenna, supra, the Court would deny the plaintiff an order. for the plaintiffs' costs at the stage of the action. In the exercise of my discretionary discretion, I would dismiss SaskPower's motion. [19] The Court has the authority to direct a security award in any event where the plaintiff, not a non-. resident, is required to deposit security. for costs. Even with respect to the joint submission made on the particular proposal. concerned, the claims for damages sustained by each. plaintiff are different as each performed different. work sustaining allegedly different damages. In short, it is not necessarily true. that if one plaintiff succeeds at trial the other. will necessarily succeed at trial as well.. The court is not obliged to make an order for security in this stage. In any event, there is an inherent jurisdiction of the Superior Courts of common law to. order security. and, if so, whether it should do so in this case. [20] There are ""appropriate. circumstances"" in which the Court can deny an order in the event of a joint claim.",13.486687407251608
"The Workers' Compensation Board applied, by way of stated case, to have the Court answer questions with respect to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case.

They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.","Appeal for the stated case.

"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion, but says that there was no wildlife damage to speak of. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted in favour of the plaintiffs, together with Pre-judgment interest from January 5, 2000 and costs. The present s.27 (1) has been in the Act since 1977, when the Act was substantially re-written, apparently in response to the increasing urbanization of the province. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes, the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle.",4.349372125116567
"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent. The respondent was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving. He moved for stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. 1)Judges of facts, whether they be juries or judges sitting alone, have a sworn duty to disclose to the trial judge any indication of criminal record. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced. The Crown did not have to disclose the criminal record in the affidavit. The appeal must be allowed.  2)The Court found that the Court of Appeal did not violate the right, guaranteed by ss. 11(d) of the Charter to any other person charged with an offence, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.",1.2108222793808188
"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each of the parties had significant assets at the time of the marriage which increased in value since that date. They agreed to keep their assets separate and to not make claim on the assets of the other. After their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. After the marriage, the petitioner returned to her Melville residence which the parties owned for approximately three and one-half years. She testified that her only expenses during the marriage were the maintenance of the residence and her share of vacation costs.. Although it may be argued that the Melville home was at one time the 'family home' of the Parties, designate the Regina condominium to be the family home pursuant to s. 22(3) of the Act as the parties resided therein for most of their marriage.. The petitioner therefore is entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: 1/2 of the condominium $42,000.00.    1)There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s.22(1) of The Family Property Act which would prevent the values of family home from being divided equally between the parties.  2)There was no evidence that the parties' verbal agreement at the marriage that each would own what they have was binding.  3)The parties had no verbal intention to divide their assets equally between them.  4)The Court was not satisfied there was any extraordinary circumstance (as provided in the Act) that would prevent them from dividing assets equally.",1.9166333952746981
"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside. There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines. The sum of $1,926.78 currently held by the Maintenance Enforcement Office shall be applied to the arrears.

"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT: The father applies to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under Archambault J.'s order. HELD: 1) The father's current income is $40,000 and the child support he will receive pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines) is $328.00. Based on the father's previous income, it appears that he is underemployed and his decision to work only three months of the year and return to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  2) On all of the evidence, the father has not behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith during family law proceeding. In light of the fact that the father sold two-thirds of his business to two other partners, he may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as child support will be payable on a net of tax basis. 3) The court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  4) The Court ordered that any sharing of s. 7 special expenses should be based on the imputed income of the father and the mother's income of $39,000.  5) It ordered that the court determine the amount of income to be imputed to the father.  6) The mother's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to work, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. The father is not without qualifications and could, believe, find employment paying reasonable salary should he choose to do so.",7.767776798942433
"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The municipality issued a tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision bylaw requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts the applicant submitted its last plan for final approval on March 14, 2000. The next day, the application was determined by the development officer to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards, and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application for final subdivision was complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan) for a period of one hundred and fifty days from the publication of the first notice advertising the council's intention to adopt or amend the subdivision by-law.. The applicant relies on the grand-parenting section of the new Municipal Government act. In reaching the conclusion that s. 283 represents the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes. It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal.",5.411638950237053

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the Government of Saskatchewan to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, in default of so doing, striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.

"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The accused pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the following additional orders. 1)The accused had no criminal record and did plead guilty albeit at trial, along with the other material referred to in the foregoing. 2)The Court found that a conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence on the facts in this matter. The accused qualifies for the same to be given to him on the limited information available that he would not endanger the community if one were imposed.  3)There was no evidence that the accused had any previous criminal record. The Court found the accused to be more of a voyeur than a actively sexual with girls and that he was prepared to participate in. psycho-psychological evolution which may or may not be beneficial in attempting to understand/treat this behaviour.",3.1333833715494084

Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents.. None of the calls were returned.. The defendant corporation's solicitor, who was represented by his current solicitor, failed to show up at the examination. HELD: The application was dismissed. The defendants were guilty of contempt of court on the basis of their conduct throughout the whole of the proceedings. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to file statements of defence.. The defendants have abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside the judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences.. The conduct of the defendants and their solicitor, however, clearly indicates that they have not maintained the level of courtesy and professionalism that is to be expected of a member of the legal profession. The court ordered that the defendants pay costs of these applications in any event of the cause.",3.388165314076902
"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. 1)The appellant chose not to testify at his trial and thereby offered no explanation. 2)The evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. 3)Upon proof of unexplained possession of recently stolen property, the trier of fact may but not must draw an inference of guilt of theft or of offences incidental thereto.",4.605305698566753
"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","HELD: The application was granted. The termination of benefits was made pursuant to s. 185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The applicant was entitled to his final income replacement benefit. The benefits were to be terminated effective the first day of his employment in Alberta. The court found that in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) of the Act, the benefits were properly terminated effective September 24, 1997. For reasons previously stated, for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 the applicant was required to attend physiotherapy in Yorkton if he was receiving a full, rather than partial, benefit. SGI was encouraged to consider Sawkiw's condition as a relapse under s. 142(1(a) and s.168(3)(b). HELD: 1)The application was set aside. 2)SGI was to pay the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the applicant and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment.  3)The applicant was to be responsible for providing SGI satisfactory evidence as to the commencement date.",6.665801511871342
"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","Divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issues for resolution in this trial were: 1) Divorce, Custody of the Children, Access to the Children and Maintenance of the Matrimonial Property.  2) The petitioner was employed and the respondent's income was unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the court declined to order any spousal support. 3) The respondent's personal debts as of June 9, 1999 were $948.00 less the sum of $11,376.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) and $97,575.19 to be paid less one-half the costs of the appraisals.",10.477775912239599
"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for: an Order declaring that the respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. HELD: The application was granted. 1)An Order declaring the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under the Charter.  2)The respondent was not an arm of the government but rather a fully dependent institution of higher learning. 3)There was no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter.  4)The applicants' contention that the Charter can apply to private activity, without connection to the government, was untenable. The Court reviewed the case law as it developed and adopted its reasoning.",2.161174454235123
"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff's employment contract was all-inclusive and that he was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for holiday pay is dismissed. The court found that if the court finds that the defendant's contract was not all inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the Labour Standards Act, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act, R.S. 1978, c. L-15 which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. There are several preliminary issues which must be dealt with at this stage. First, the defendant claims the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and, in the event the court determined this Court had jurisdiction to determine that right, it would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff was now allowed to assert that right.. The defendant also asserts that if he was to be allowed to claim his holiday pay, he should only have been entitled to the amount of $8.00 per month for the period April 1988 to March 1991. The jury awarded the plaintiff damages in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Second, the court awarded him $1,000 in damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination. The amount on which any holiday pay should be based on his wage, his truck allowance and his cellular phone allowance is not included in the calculation of holiday pay. There was nothing in the plaintiff’s proposal that addressed the issue that holidays were really wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. There were several other preliminary issues, including whether the court was to consider whether the plaintiff had been awarded holiday pay in excess of one year and, if so, if it was to determine if the Court was to rebut the presumption arising from the wording of the Act, which was clearly rebuttable presumption arising out of requirement in the",10.239742267352577
"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The application was for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial, in the alternative to determination of the question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice. This right is subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non- conveniens and that a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. It was an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial in Nova Scotia and, as I have previously stated, the rule is that the substantive law that governs will be the law of the place where the accident occurred. If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law, before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place.",0.6968932847651355
"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff, now Sylvia Schira, decided to purchase a home in 1998. She engaged the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, operating as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998, and after lengthy searching, she discovered that the realtor, Cecilia Mui, had misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. She sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants. 1) The house did not meet her expectations. The realtor was not the one buying the property. She was the only one selling it. She did not know that the property fell below the standard of care required of a professional realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. 2) The plaintiff was not aware that the defendant had entered into a confidential agreement with her. She had not seen the property for several years and had not been able to obtain a copy of the PCDS. She now claims aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the plaintiff and her former husband. The court found that the defendants were liable to her in the amount of $299,000 for the alleged defects. She also claims costs based upon mental and emotional distress.  3) The Court found that both the defendant and the plaintiff's realtor were negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The Court awarded the plaintiff $285,000 plus costs based on mental, emotional and physical distress. 4) There was no discussion of home inspection. The defendant's conduct of the search did not warrant a hearing on the issue of latent defects. It was clear from reading of the building permit that it was not within her means to purchase the property and that the plaintiff had not proven that she could afford to buy it. 5) The defendant and his company were not liable to the plaintiff in any way. They did not disclose any conditions of the property that were not readily apparent to her.",29.896761036760303

"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court found that the proceeds from the judicial sale should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to the purchase money portion of the debt. 2) The decision in Hrynewich Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out earlier in this judgment. 3) There are two issues to determine: a) the proper amount of the deficiency judgment; and 4) how should proceeds of the sale be applied to the mortgage balance, and what is the proper level of the judgment. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA and held that all the proceeds, whether from the land initially purchased or land held as collateral security, should be distributed pro rata between the purchase, non, and purchase money balances..  4) The court found that s.25 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for a mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. 5) The appeal was allowed with respect to the balance owing on the mortgage. The Court reviewed the decisions of the Chambers judge in Andrew (CA) and found that it should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied, and the remaining LCRA protection. 6) The judge reviewed the decision of the respondent Bank of Montreal (BC) and the Court of Queen's Bench (Q.C.). 7) It was clear the Court was aware of its previous decision, but it was forgetful of its conclusions as to how sale proceeds should be treated against the mortgage balances. It was also instructive when interpreting the spirit and intent of S. 25. 8) The issue on appeal dealt with the issue of whether the sales proceeds of a sale of land by a judicial listing order or a mortgagee can, after identifying the portion of an agreement for sale in writing, or mortgaged whether by legal or equitable mortgage for the purpose of securing the purchase or additional new debt, the mortgagee was entitled to bring action against the purchaser. The court held that the sale",6.015933135435626
"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward final agreement would constitute separate, independent and binding agreements irrespective of whether they were made on a formal written offer to be served on the other party (Rule 183), and means of enforcing offers made and accepted under the Rules 181 and Rule 181. 3)The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that settlement should not be enforced by the court.",4.078829412428144
"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters and to reduce arrears of approximately $14,600. HELD: The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per month per child during months when his gross monthly income was $2,200 or greater and $150 per child when his adjusted gross income was less than or equal to his social assistance payments. Arrears were reduced by $7,000 and the father was to pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to the on thegoing child support obligation. A flexible order would be appropriate. The father's employment was uncertain in his trade.",4.855720422610043
"Revenue Canada, which was owed $166,359.72 for goods and services tax for 1991-92 and $14,223.30 for 1991 unpaid personal income tax, and the Michaluks, who were owed $58,720.34 for a failed agreement and lease on their property in Manitoba, objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","Two creditors objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt, Revenue Canada, on the basis that the bankrupt's business failure combined with pressure from creditors such as the Michaluk's caused the bankrupt to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. The bankrupt submitted that this was a final matter and Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. HELD: 1)The bankrupt's application for discharge was granted with a conditional order for $1,750.00. 2)The court found that there was no evidence that the principle and exemption contained in s.172(1)(a) of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances of Clearsky in these proceedings. 3)The Court found that the Court could not accept that the principles and exemption of s.295(5)(a of the Act would permit disclosure of certain paragraphs of the affidavit. 4)The application for a discharge was opposed by certain creditors. 5)A review of the possible orders that may be granted by the court was ordered.  6)The bankruptcy was not the type of bankruptcy that was to be rewarded by an absolute order of discharge.  7)Rule 319 requires that affidavit evidence be based on facts and beliefas opposed to knowledge.  8)It was not necessary for the bankruptcy to proceed.  9)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 of the Affidavit of James Douglas Cook is confidential and disclosure of this information is improper for these proceeding.",2.396420431920349
"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and child support less than two years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. HELD: 1) This proceeding involves applications to vary the Corollary Relief Judgement dated November 16, 1998, and June 4, 1999. The parties have not addressed the issue of costs directly, pending the court's decision.  2) The court reviewed the financial information, the family's and Mr. Vermeulen's income over the years, and also the family’s standard of living and concluded there was a material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and his improved employment and income situation. She also sought a lump sum support payment of $20,000 to reimburse her for moving expenses.  3) This was a request made less than 2 years after the trial decision. Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., it would appear that success has been divided and that the court should not order a lump-sum award to compensate the petitioner for her relocation expenses. 4) The Court ordered the lump sum award of $8,000.",2.6243280128155946

However, he is also the sole shareholder of a corporation and the 50% owner of another corporation. The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue between the parties is the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 9, 1993.

He has asserted that the indebtedness of the company is $1,600,000. However, nearly $600,00 of that debt represents shareholders loans.

"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants applied pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision by the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed. 1)The rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. The landlord's claim has been sufficiently proven and an Order should be made placing the Landlord in possession of the rental premises. 2)Did the Chambers judge err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid?  3)The tenants had until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their notice of appeal and 15 days thereafter to file their appeal book and factum.

"The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained. The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial. The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain her in custody even before she had a trial, before anyone has given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law, and before she has had a chance to defend herself at a trial. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial..

"The two accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: A fine plus a probation order with strict condition can accomplish the principles of sentencing. Each accused is fined $1,500 with a probation order for two years. Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to a charge of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused had previously been employed in the construction industry for 23 years and had a previous criminal record. The Crown asserted that each of the accused had previous criminal records, but did not file these with the court, instead choosing to rely on the information contained in the pre-sentence reports in relation to each accused's previous criminal history. HELD: The Court imposed a fine of $1,500 plus a probation order for 2 years. The Court ordered the accused to pay a victim fine surcharge of $225.00 plus one year probation for two years, and ordered that he comply with the terms of the probation order. The court ordered that the accused comply with all of the conditions set out in s. 732.1(5) of The Criminal Code, including the prohibition of alcohol, crack, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol and other drugs, and that he not have contact with any of the parties involved in the assault. The offence was not one for which incarceration is appropriate, taking into consideration both the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, the facts of the offence, the severity of the injuries and the minor criminal records of the two accused.

"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","HELD: The court declined to issue summonses as requested. The issues raised by these claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating but that litigation, in my view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made.",6.319535884190435
"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced to Roper Ltd. under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and equipment rentals. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses arising from the unjustified termination of the contract. HELD: The contract was awarded. The court found that the plaintiff's responsibilities were not as extensive as they would have been if the wording in the original invitation for tenders had been used. The contractual obligation to maintain the banks, ditches, railway and power plants was to be construed by the wording and general conditions set out in the tender. The provisions in the contract incorporated the terms and conditions contained in the specifications and were not used for reasons other than the breakdown of the equipment itself. The plaintiff was also required to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being banked and thereby reduce the build up of methane gas and the risk of fire within the banks. The equipment supplied by Roper was not the same type and model of equipment as it listed in the response to the tender, and no objection appeared to have been taken with the equipment delivered to the site.",3.915378526266812
"The Crown appealed a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day imposed after the respondent pled guilty to three break and enters of dwelling houses and theft and possession of stolen property in February and March as well as two breaches of undertakings in March and June 2000. HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: break and enter a dwelling house, to wit, jewellery the property of Marlene Brower of a value not exceeding five thousand dollars knowing it was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. The sentencing judge noted the alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety, and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December of 1999. She further considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand.",1.8806544854947713
"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. HELD: The Crown appealed. The sentence imposed was inadequate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the co-accused's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for, and we are all of the accused. The Crown argued that the sentencing circle was inappropriate in the circumstances because the respondent was on drugs at the time of the offences and the main player was the defendant. The court found that the offender had a record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences and had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times.. He had a grade three education and did not have a significant employment history.",5.401781643277878

The applicant took no steps to appeal within the 21 day period due to an inadvertence of its lawyer. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plain and ordinary meaning of the words of s. 14(2) of the Act is that only the court appealed from has power to extend the time within which leave must be sought. Section 14(2) of the Act prevails over s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000.","This was an application for an order extending the time to apply for leave to appeal and for leave on appeal.

"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings.  1)There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges.  2)There has been no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments from the dates of December 14, 2004 to November 3, 2004, and June 14, 2006. Limitations on institutional resources caused delays in this case.  3)The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until her ready to have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial.. 4)The court found that there was a general guideline delay of eight to ten months in Provincial Court. The Court found that the accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities, and has caused her stress and frustration. 5)The Court found the prejudice was such as to outweigh the public interest in having her tried for the charge. 6)There was a breach of the accused's right to a fair trial.",2.9029964318313115

The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","HELD: The Court found that the Court could not categorize the violence between the parties during the incident in question, nor the other unpleasant events that had occurred in their relationship, as domestic violence requiring the Father's access to be supervised. The Court ordered that the father must attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. The court found that there was no evidence that the Father had actually harmed the child and that there were many other risks to his and the child's relationship with other parents.",5.454934107385913
"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property, the Court granted the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and the respondent husband 44%. The husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required surgery on his back and became even worse in 1994 and as result. he made voluntary assignment into bankruptcy on February 14, 1994. As a result, a hearing date was set for May 13 at which the respondent was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division. The petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the Spousal Maintenance Order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)Division of property was based on asset values which are at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in a whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings.  2)The respondent's claim for set-off was allowed. 3)The wife was entitled to a share of the proceeds from the sale of certain cattle. squeeze for $400 in order to achieve a 50% split of the assets to each party. 4)The husband was to pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately for $9,000. 5)The petitioner's wife was to be entitled to the following set off to be included in her share. 6)The court awarded the respondent a share in the proceeds of the sale. 7)The parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and grain on. hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy.  8)The Court awarded the husband a portion of the amount of $48,200. The court ordered the division to be divided based on the values indicated by the evidence. The Court ordered that the division be made on the basis of the values determined by the trustee in bankruptcy.",6.744158074419657
"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.

"The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine.

The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable.

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default.

"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted them on numerous occasions. From all of the evidence and applying the McKenzie analysis, the Court was satisfied that both victims were sexually assaulted by the accused. The Court found the accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The accused took every chance he could to get more. There was no medical evidence and no corroboration of digital penetration.. The Court concluded that the sexual assaults occurred over a number of years, many times, and that these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion the accused was in the company of the girls. There were three aggravating factors: 1) the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just over their clothing, and 2) that there was digital penetration by him. The Crown asked the Court to find that the assault occurred over several years, and the accused agreed to a sentencing hearing pursuant to s724(4)(e).

Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly.

This defendant has joined the defendants as Third Parties seeking contribution and/or indemnity from them. HELD: The Court found that there was a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff in any case where negligent misconduct has been alleged against a government agency. The court found that the defendant had a duty to maintain its highways and that it was not necessary to substitute its decision for the authority's decision on those matters when they were committed by the legislature to the authority for decision. There was no evidence that the plaintiff had suffered damage from the disease.

"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The applicants apply for relief pursuant to s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The application is granted. The Court finds that s.300 of the Code constitutes a reasonable limit in free and democratic society on the. freedom of expression guaranteed by s.2(b) of the Charter and is of no force or effect. 1)The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free, democratic society. The principles underlying the guaranteed right to freedom of speech under the Charter are met. 2)Defamatory libel is a matter published without lawful justification or excuse that is likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed to damage the officer's integrity. The court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. 3)S.300 is a limit prescribed by law. It is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. 4)The court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by the Code, not only the expressions involved in this particular case. 5)The application is made pursuant to ss.300 and 301.

In this case, the accused were charged with defamation. The offence was committed against the officer of the City of Saskatoon. The accused were to be arrested and charged with defaming the officer.  11)The offences were committed in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (a. remedy now abolished).  12)The definition of defamation is vague and uncertain. The objective of the offence is to protect persons from the harm caused by false. and defamed.

"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions pursuant to s. 209 of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act. The appellant, Guardian Insurance Company of Canada, is the general liability insurer of the respondent Kellogg Canada Inc. (Kellogg). The respondent is the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg.. Mr. McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At the time of the accident, McLeod, Kellogg and McLeod's wife were sued as result of the automobile accident.. The respondent agreed it had an obligation to defend but submitted that Royal also had a duty to defend in the name and on behalf of the insured. The chambers judge rejected this argument and clearly did not find ambiguity in the coverage provided by the policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no evidence that the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. The Court of Appeal held that there was no duty on the insurer to defend a policy that did not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings. The court found that the issue of indemnity arises only when the claims disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. When the allegations do not come within the policy coverage, the insurer has no obligation to protect.",8.502269457819438
"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel for the parties. The applicant argued that the position taken before Wimmer J. (who directed the issue to trial) was that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance for Jade based on the needs-based approach, and that the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs is dismissed.  1)The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. The Court is not obliged to permit unnecessary litigation to be paid for by the estate. 2)The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 184C of The Queen's Bench Rules allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the Rules in assessing appropriate costs.",5.114836537861358
"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on two counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. 1)The balancing of competing interests is difficult, but in this case, the prejudice to the accused has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.  2)The Crown has conceded its responsibility for the delay in this matter. It has attempted to explain the delay and to use the 'protective shield' of s. 11(b) as an offensive weapon. However, there is no evidence that the accused suffers prejudice because of the delay. 3)There is no inference as to prejudice from the length of delay or where the most reasonable inference is the other way, the accused may have to call evidence if he is to displace the strong public interest in bringing those charged with an offence to trial.",4.435641051128225
"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties share joint custody of the three children of a numbered company solely owned by the father. The father is opposed to the payment of spousal support in any form, arguing that it involves every second weekend and that the children will have an opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future.. The father has been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. HELD: The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order shall issue and primary care shall remain with the mother. There was no evidence that the father has any interest but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother's position is that this property was operated from joint family account and, therefore, a family asset and must be divided equally. 1)The father is not committed to maintaining the children's relationship with their father. He does not seek periodic or lump sum support. The children's best interests are served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their mother. 2)The mother is prepared to consult but wants the final say when they cannot agree. 3)Piano lessons and musical instruments are extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and are necessary and reasonable.",2.896893530112789
"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along Highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia.. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11 of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked and his charge was dismissed. The only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving on the highways while his license was revved. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive an ATV on the road because it was a prohibited motor vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license. The Court found that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an AT vehicle and that even if those words did, the accused should be found guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive such a vehicle. Since there is no nexus between his driving of the ATV and his 'driver's license' was revoked he is guilty of this offence.",3.0766460004264116
"The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act. The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appealed the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act. They contended the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and sought to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The matter was remitted to the hearing officers for rehearing pursuant to s. 70(11)(c) of the Act. The court found the reasons inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter was returned to the Hearing Officer for re rehearing. The tenants did not dispute that rent was owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. The tenant's application is not formally before hearing officer at the same time as landlord's application does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord's dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant's facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order.. Further, as the tenants had filed separate claim under the tenancy agreement, the two claims should have been considered in the exercise of her 'just and equitable' discretion.",1.639836275759628
"SGI applied on behalf of the defendant for an order under Queen's Bench Rule 107A(c) and s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act for leave to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to the action. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant to an order pursuant to Rule 107A(c) of The Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of The Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant, William J. Schmidt, to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. HELD: The application was granted as requested. 1) There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for local authority to limit its liability. Section 154(1.1) of the Urban Municipality Act, 1984 states that no action may be brought pursuant to subsection (1) for the recovery of damages. The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it.  2) There was no evidence that the defendant had filed material which established a prima facie claim against the City and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiffs if the third party claim was grafted onto the action. 3) The application to add Saskatoon to the list of third party parties was granted.",2.5982812872077967

Default judgment granted in the within matter December 1, 2014 against the defendants, Mario Di Battista and R-Rock Concrete (2013). (R-Rock) in the amount of $19,393. HELD: The default judgment was set aside pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Small Claims Act, now in excess of one year from the granting of the judgment. The applicant sought to have the judgment set aside.  1) The court granted the default judgment in the manner prescribed by s.37(2).

"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in right of Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the defendant filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the current legislative mandate reflected in s.35.1 was prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The court found that no order can issue with respect to property seized before this legislation came into force.. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the legislation was retroactive to the time the property was seized. It was not necessary to change the statute to recognize the process of when that clock should start. The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity was found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk sworn December 15, 2016.. The Director’s application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s. 35.1. There was a presumption against retroactive application of statutes insofar as legislation has either retroactive or prospective effect.",3.9334025418486505
"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The accused was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of 1 year, 7 months to 12 years, with no parole eligibility until he had served half of that sentence. The Crown requested that the Court make an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case. 1) The Crown must demonstrate a foundation for such additional rigour in the sentencing of the offender. The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel for the Crown and defence and found that there were multiple Gladue factors relevant to the accused taken as a whole. The court found that the Crown should not rely on the evidence of the accused's past criminal record, the fact that he was drinking heavily at the time of the offence and that there was a gap in his record from 1994 to 2006 when he was charged with 10 stab wounds and his attack on his landlord displayed a sustained attack on a vulnerable person.. 2) There are multiple factors to consider in determining a sentence for the offence of manslaughter in the Province of Saskatchewan. There are isolated instances of sentences less than 4 years, but sentences greater than 12 years ought to occur only in the most unusual, exceptional or extenuating circumstances.",4.14292545142047
"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province of Nova Scotia is responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the students of the province and the Province bears the responsibility for negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Respondent, the Minister of Education (theMinister) is required to reimburse the Cape Breton Board for the costs incurred by it in leasing these school buildings from the Church. HELD: The application was granted. There was no evidence any of the six buildings were not required to meet the basic needs of the students now attending the school. It was the responsibility of the Province to pay the lease costs. Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet its statutory obligation, the cost of such a lease is the province's responsibility. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the costs of supplying the building free of costs. There would not be any costs.",2.1412206364684327
"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s.5.3 or from the context of the entire statute, or from a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The words of the Trade Union Act require two conditions for the exercise of the power to make interim orders: the existence of an application or complaint before the Labour Relations Board, and the presence of power in the arbitration board to make a final order in respect of the application. The question decided by the Board was clearly jurisdictional and so treated it as patently unreasonable. The board recognized it to be jurisdictional question and treated it.",2.1364334189261713
"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case is whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed with costs as usual and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The wording of the s. 303(1) of The Rural Municipality Act, 1989, S.S. 1989-90, c. U-11, refers to the rural municipality Act, 1984. It is not clear that the legislature intended that notice of appeals be given within 20 days of the mailing of the notice to the administrator of the R.M. of Gull Lake. 2)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. Were it otherwise, an administrator, having received notice of a appeal by registered mail within the allotted time, could lawfully decline to act upon it on the footing the property owner had failed to give notice.. 3)It is difficult to think that the proper exercise of the right to appeal, when notice is given by the means of a registered mail, should be made to, as distinct from requiring them to serve notice upon, the administrator within the period prescribed by the Act. However, this is a comparatively narrow context, concerned as it is with the meaning of the word give in virtual isolation, removed from the purpose of the subsection and the objectives of its terms. The matter is one of implication having regard to the considerations mentioned in Newell Smelski. 4)The issue of time requirements of this sort is a matter of pure statutory interpretation and therefore depends in short upon what the legislature most probably intended, given the wording, purpose, and objectives of the Act, such that substantial compliance with statutory requirements of the scheme of the enactment.",1.217653407053054
"The plaintiff lawyer commenced an action for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. The proposed garnishee, SPMC, paid $337.46 into court and brought an application for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC. Labour Standards filed notice of potential wage claims. The plaintiff obtained default judgment and made an ex parte application for payment out of the monies paid into court by SPMC. HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out. The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim. No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff.

The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along.. HELD: The accused's evidence was accepted. For reasons which I will discuss later in this decision, where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and that of the accused, I accept the evidence.  1) The officer's lack of cander in giving his evidence in this regard has raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter.  2) The mental element of the offence of refusal created by Section 254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance.  3) The accused was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. The officer was wearing white sunglasses placed on top of his head. He testified that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District, Saskatchewan, on the date in question with 'ride-along'. The officer observed the accused's vehicle swerve to the right side of the highway more than necessary as he approached it.. He was told to blow into the machine. He blew three times in all. During the blowing, he recalled the officer being on the telephone and saying 'he seems to be fully co-operative.. don’t know what’s going on.’  4) Although the accused had not told the young, inexperienced officer of why he thought he may have been having difficulty blowing sufficient sample for the officer, he did tell the court he is asthmatic.. His asthma is worse when exposed to animal hair.. The evening before he helped his son skin deer which his son had just shot.. He had to use his prescribed inhaler then and again at the party where he had had his two or three beer.. He noted the odour of alcohol coming from his vehicle.. He did not inform the officer of anything.. The officer said he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again..

"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the notice was filed more than 20 days ago: Rule 62.04(4).. The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. The appellants wish to add as ground of appeal that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security for costs. The appellant intervenor opposes the amendment on three grounds: that the allegations of champerty and maintenance that underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the chambers judge, were irrelevant to the security for a costs application, were not ruled on by chambers judge and should not be raised on appeal; and that the torts of property and maintenance have been eliminated by the common law and are not reasonably necessary to the appellants' presentation of their appeal.

"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was found guilty of dangerous driving, assault and driving with a weapon. The accused was also found to have violated s. 266 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge found that the accused intentionally drove in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner intended to scare the complainant. She was entitled to deference in her assessment of the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the circumstances or the seriousness of the assault. The Court was not entitled to re-weigh the evidence and to substitute my own opinion for that of the judge.  1)The trial judge failed to err in failing to give effect to implied consent and in adopting zero tolerance. 2)The accused's conduct was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver in similar circumstances.",2.391119395564773
"On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This is an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued, subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering such losses to keep them to minimum.

"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment of May 2, 1995, such that the applicant would have sole custody of his daughter, Letitia.

The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected. The minor prejudice beyond the normal and expected was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.","FIAT. The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and s.2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The accused was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He agreed the delay had not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. 2)The delay in the circumstances outlined above was not unreasonable. Further, the accused did not explicitly or implicitly waive delay. There is no necessity. to impute improper motives to the accused for certain. portions of the delay are sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. 3)The time for measuring delay is from the time the charge is laid until the date of trial. It is necessary for the Court to go. through the Morin analysis of 'actions of the accused' (R. v. Morin, 71 C.C.C., 3d). The accused's right to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the total time delay involved.",4.364184192634641
"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. The plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the following: 1) The defendant has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-manager one. 3) The plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. He put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate time period of 7 months. The Court awarded the plaintiff taxable costs.",7.5322625887514505
"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father, Gilbert Hill, to pay maintenance for his son, who was now 19 years old. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by Mr. Hill to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000. The court found that the order for support was not premised on James' continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order. There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and depart from it. The Court was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident.",2.315966881451657
"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. HELD: The application was allowed and set aside. The costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke were to be costs in the cause of the action. 1)In this particular application involving a rear-end collision, there was a heavier burden on the defendant. There had to be an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument. 2)There was no air of reality to the defence of the plaintiff's claim. 3)The Court was not satisfied that this was an appropriate case to order an order for summary judgement. The Court was unable to make a determination of the amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at and would only be a haphazard guess. There was no evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the defendants.",2.4445659147314194
"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review and that the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded. The appeal should be allowed and ordered. A new trial was ordered. There was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the evidence. The judge applied the proper test, which was whether reasonable inferences can be drawn from the contents of the Information to Obtain which could establish reasonable and probable grounds to determine if evidence of a crime could be found in the impugned place. The evidence obtained by the tipster, while disclosing few details, was not compelling and the judge substituted her discretion for that of the issuing judge.",3.5361398600626543
"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","This was an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is not relevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities and concluded that there was no Charter breach and that the evidence was admissible and ought not to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Code. There was no evidence of bad faith or bad faith. The evidence should be classified as conscriptive evidence because the consenting party essentially acted as police agent in. the course of the conversation. It is reasonable to presume that such a scenario could quite likely result in producing evidence highly relevant to the investigation. The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. 2)It was not necessary to weigh the factors in accordance with s.24(2). 3)If there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent -the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence that there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought. 4)The accused's evidence was non-conscriptive. It was not admissible to exclude the evidence. It did not have to be produced in the Court of Appeal to determine whether there was an appropriate. basis for exclusion. 5)The Court found that the accused was not acting in breach of his Charter rights. He was acting in good faith. He did not rely on the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stillman, supra, for 'automatic exclusion' without engaging the weighing process outlined in s.7(d). 607. SCC, 113 C.C. (3d) 321. 6)Reasons for exclusion include: 1)No Charter breach was found and the evidence is admissible.   2)There was no breach of the evidence pursuant to s.16(2)(c) of The Charter. 3)No evidence was obtained pursuant to a valid authorization of intercepting private communications. There were no errors in weighing the factors.",5.7971489862282946
"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act of Ontario for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel, Merchant Law Group, (MLG), examine the plaintiff on her affidavit. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The plaintiff was not entitled to cross examine the defendant on an affidavit. The examination may end up being more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt via Ms. Moore to get information from Red Seal itself as to its customer data base that Red Seal may have regarding customers that may have booked with Red Seal during the proposed class. 2) Based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit, the Court must dismiss the application for examination on the affidavit. 3) The Court must not rely on s. 14 prior to certification of the action as a class action. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply.. The practices and implementation of the Rules of Court do not get suspended merely because this is an action. There have not been any previous cases in which a plaintiff was allowed to cross-examine a defendant on a document. The Court has jurisdiction to make pre-certification orders. 4) In this case, the court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might have booked through Red Seal for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. It was clear that the defendant was taking the position that the plaintiff had no claim and would be moving for summary judgment. 5) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining the plaintiff is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys. Rather, it is a more general and broad ranging interrogation of the plaintiff about other customers who may have book booked through her office with the defendant at the relevant time of this case. It is important to note that the wording of s.14 and s.24 of the Act in this case creates concern about the suspension of time limitations. 6) The application is dismissed for failure to produce proper representative plaintiff.",3.4022419714659318
"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","HELD: The court found that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find his net income, and then reduced the IRB to 90% on the basis of pre-judgment interest. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non-earner’s IRB are in keeping with his earning reality. The IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the income replacement benefit payable during the first 180 days after the accident, as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. Counsel for Montgrand also appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand. Counsel now concedes SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states, “Interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act.” The Court found that s. 117(3) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, s. 24 of the PIPR Regulations, and s. 135 of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which are the relevant sections for claims made in 2001, state: 1) The Court held that the hearing judge erred in holding that the Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) for the post 180 day period was not to be more than the amount received for the 180 days. The Court also held that it would not be a rational or fair interpretation for SGI to deduct the income tax from all income earners and not the other types of earners. 2) SGI argued that the Act is intended to correlate victim's income with his or her earning reality and that once the annualized sum of $28,889.75 was set, the provisions of s.117(4) do not apply. The legislation attempts to find the income of all victims. 3) The Act is designed to correlate a victim's employment income but not the income from an accident. 4) The provisions of ss. 117 (3) and ss. 24(1) of Saskatchewan Regulations contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. 5) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighted average approach' used by SGI in calculating the net income for",4.412610338225112
"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out in Rimmer v. Adshead 2004 SKQB 536 (CanLII). It was clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient. The parties separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation.. At the time of the judgment, the appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53.. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively.. After the marriage, the respondent had worked at Safeway, but took a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000.. She was disabled and still receiving treatments. She still lived with her father and was attending school.. The respondent was receiving social assistance in the sum of $14,000 annually. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the appellant on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. He found the appellant's income to be $38,964.37 and found her capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage. She was also disabled and did not know when she would be well enough to work 40 hours per week.. She had taken vocational training course for computers and reflexology course since losing the Westfair position but had been unable to receive any offers of employment since losing it. She also had some health problems. She had been diagnosed with shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica.. She paid child support of $600 per month. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court found that the Court's approach to Sandomirsky J. on a review of the issue of spousals in light of Rimmer was in error. The Court held that the approach of Sandomierk J. (2005) 259 Sask. R. 161 per Dawson J. at paragraph 67. It was clearly not intended to be an error. 2) It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish that she is unable to become self-sufficient. 3) The court found that retroactive support was appropriate.",6.758986976933837

The Husband had not made an interim lump sum payment in the amount of $2,000.00 ordered in May and had undertaken to provide support monies after harvest. The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children, aged 16 and 13, and an order prohibiting the husband from contacting her and from going to her home or her workplace. HELD: The application was granted. The husband was ordered to have exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard. He was also ordered to pay monthly child support retroactive to July 1. The court ordered that the husband be denied the right to enter the farm machinery and farm yard now that he is finished farming for the year. The Court directed that the Registrar allot a pre-trial date acceptable to both parties.  1)The Court was not prepared to vary or extend the order of May 27 and the extended order of October 19 which forbids the husbandfrom approaching the home quarter. 2)The evidence presented by the wife was simply her assertion that her husband has been earning. money which enables him to pay periodic support. He denies disposing of farm machinery, tools and farm machinery since the date of the order, other than the canola crop. which he harvested from rented land. He has not yet paid most of the production costs of the crop. He says he is looking for work but. because he is retired, he doesn't expect to find any work. 3)The court ordered the husband to pay half the value of. the crop, $200 per month for each of the children, retroactive July 1, and that he be denied access to the tools shed and the farmyard. 4)The husband was prohibited from entering the farm for the purpose of farming for. the year and from entering it for the same purpose. 5)It was not clear from the evidence that he was earning any of the money he was required to pay in support of his two children that he had continued to earn. money he had been earning from trucking and leasing out farm machinery for. custom work on neighbouring farms. He denied earning any money for driving truck or for custom farm work. Any driving he did was to help his son. and he drew no wages for it. whenever he wished. 6)The wife was also seeking an order that the Court be made to grant the husband access to his farm home retroactively to.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT: The Crown applies to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence to date, she has demonstrated a hostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. The Crown seeks to use her prior statement, not only for the purposes of impeaching her credibility at trial, but also as substantive evidence that may be left with the jury at the end of the trial. HELD: 1)The Crown is entitled to place the witness's prior statement on the evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established.  2)The evidence introduced on the voir dire confirms that the witness is not adverse, but is now telling the truth after lying about certain matters in her statement; 3)There is nothing unfair or that. would bring the administration of justice into disrepute in the case of this statement.",3.6187583191875476
"The accused, employed as doorman and relief bartender at the time of the altercation, was charged with assault causing bodily harm in which the complainant sustained significant injuries to his head and face. Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a doorman and relief bartender. During the course of the night, there were two minor incidents and exchanges between Baikie, his associates, and the accused, neither of which progressed beyond the verbal stage. Baikies observed the accused make a motion or gesture which he interpreted as an invitation to become involved with him, and that the accused punched him over the shoulder, and then swung back and hit him on the back of the head, saw stars, and woke up in the off-sale part of the bar. The accused worked at the penitentiary. He met some friends and associates and spent the night socializing and dancing. He was employed as a bartender and did not drink on the job. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 1)The accused did not act in self defence. Even if he was, he used more force than necessary. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justifies the assault.. 2)The Court accepted the accused's evidence that he threw only one punch, or Lillis' evidence of he and Layman knocked him out by falling on him. The injuries were not consistent with this scenario. 3)The court accepted the argument that he was acting in self-defence. 4)There was no evidence the accused was restrained in any way by the accused or by his co-workers. The court accepted that he did not have a clear shot at the accused. 5)The Crown did not accept the defence's argument that the 'threat of violence' was used to prevent the accused from getting involved in the altercation. 6)The facts relevant to the determination of the issues were as stated by the Crown. The facts were not accepted by the Court.",6.925560050954215

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment. The child was with the mother every afternoon during her hospitalization and the mother bonded with her son. The father is currently employed at Ipsco on shift work and is currently living with his parents. The father has had the child since the separation and the child has had little access with his mother. HELD: The child's primary residence should be with the mother. Based on the information before the Court, the mother has always been the primary caregiver of the child and remained at home with the child for the first year of his life. The mother was responsible for the child's day to day needs, health care and child care. As well the father asserts that he was involved in the child's health care needs but was unable to name the child's pediatrician. The father will have access to the child for three days when he is not working including overnight access.

"The respondent was recruited by the respondents. Her job was to start quality assurance practice. She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so. After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal.

Cognos, 1993 CanLII 3563 (NS SC), 171 N.S.R. (2d) 360. The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the action on the basis that the term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort.",2.754070631248492
"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. HELD: The Crown applied, pursuant to ss. 19(4) and s. 20(4), to an order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln is not affected by any forfeiture order.  1) The Crown had previously applied pursuant s. 18 and 19 (the ""Act"") for an Order of forfeiture of the Lincoln. The Crown argued that the Lincoln was not a 'offence-related property' but rather a conveyance which was used to facilitate the commission of a designated substance offence. 2) Section 19(d) provides the authority for the court to grant relief to those who have been convicted or charged with the offence and, on balance of probabilities, that the property is not likely to have been used in connection with that offence. It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S16(1). 3) The Court has the powers of the Court upon the hearing of an application for relief. The Court is satisfied that the applicant has an interest in a forfeitable conveyance and that she has exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that it was not likely that it would be used in a commission of an unlawful act by the person who was permitted by the applicant to obtain possession of the property or from whom the applicant obtained possession or, where the applicant is mortgagee or lienholder, by the mortgagor or a family member, or by the Minister as the Minister thinks fit. 4) It would only be on rare and unique occasions that court will find a sentence so grossly disproportionate that it violates the provisions of s. 12 of the Charter.",4.494265614814493
"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000. It did not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather, specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime. Variation of the Child Support Regime. The parties agreed to impute income to the respondent. The respondent was to pay child support in a fixed amount based upon his reported income but rather to reflect his true income including cash and unreported income. The petitioner was to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent.

"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. The plaintiff's action could not succeed for the following reasons: 1)The plaintiff had not been properly trained on the proper procedure for disconnection requests. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the defendant have any less value on the sale of the property in the process.  2)The Court found that the action could only succeed if the plaintiff’s action was successful.",0.8875229291130728
"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3).

"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block, range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened.. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: 1)The accused is charged with aggravated assault. The Court found that the accused committed the offences in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. 2)The Court determined that the existence of an actual assault is not a prerequisite for defence under s.34(2). 3)The Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries were not serious enough to be considered 'aggravated'. 4)The court found that, in all of the circumstances of this case, the accused's perception of the situation is subjective, but the accused’s belief must be objectively reasonable on the basis of his perceiving the situation that he was in. 5)The evidence from the video, the evidence of corrections officers and the testimony of Knife was that he, Coutu and Raphael all moved in unison with the purpose of attacking Dorion. The Crown did not need to establish the accused knew that something was about to happen and that it was going to be 'bad' and that Dorion was the recipient of some type of violence.",3.6092408248902834
"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant was granted judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code.  1) The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an application for judicial interim released in an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance more severely than the Court would do in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Code..  2) Romania's submissions as to the deficiencies in the nature and extent of the sureties proffered by the applicant are compelling and the risk of his non- reappearance is high.  3) There is no reason to consider the third test under s679(3)(c).  4) The application for interim release is dismissed.  5) It is not appropriate for the Minister to make such an inquiry as these are matters clearly and properly left to the Minister under s40 of the criminal code.,1.6845972564295482
"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.",HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was not supported by the facts of the case. The court found that s. 23 of The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransaskois schools in Saskatchewan. The Court held that the Court’s decision not to renew their provisional permission to attend was based entirely on the continuing failure of the Lawless family to honour their commitments to the school and that support for their success did not exist in this case.,3.801198150370998
"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children, Gage Arthur and Haydn Lee Dion Wolfe. The mother and father lived together as common-law spouses for 18 years. After the mother separated from the father, the father commenced providing daily care to the children. The father was granted supervised access with the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. HELD: There was an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997, s. 1997, c C-8.2.. The designation of the grandmother is not binding when considering whether or not to grant person's sufficient interest status to the father. Not only does the grandmother have sufficient interest regarding the children, but she has demonstrated and a settled ongoing commitment to the child. The court has no difficulty determining that the mother and the father have sufficient relationship. The grandmother is a person with sufficient interest in the children and her access with them is sporadic prior to the mother's move. There are five people currently residing in the home. One of them is the grandmother who is making an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service on the grandmother. The other person is the father of the children.. The court reviewed the extensive affidavit material filed and heard from counsel on behalf of both parties and found that there was no difficulty in determining whether the grandmother has sufficient interest. The evidence from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board was that the grandmother was a person sufficient interest with respect to her children and that she was willing to provide the father with parenting time with them. There was also evidence that the father had been living with the grandmother for a number of years prior to her moving to Saskatoon and that there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs prior to his move. The parties had a child together in 2005 when the mother was pregnant with the parties' oldest son, Arty.. The parties separated in 2009 and the mother moved into the grandmother's home after the mother divorced her husband. She left her employment to stay home to look after the children with the father commencing visits with them in February 2011.. The father moved into a new residence with the mother in February 2015. The relationship between the grandmother and the children continued for some time until the father moved out of Saskatoon in February 2016. He is now living with his aunt, Arlene Viden, and they have two children together in",11.875822577907892
