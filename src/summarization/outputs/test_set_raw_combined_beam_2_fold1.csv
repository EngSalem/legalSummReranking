2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the mother. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and various other persons. The petitioner has reasonable access including every second Sunday, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods. The child is likely affected to varying degrees by the discord between the parties. The parents were ordered to complete a Parenting After Separation course. Both parties must file a certificate of completion once the course is completed. 1)The parties raised in their material the issue of each other's lack of cooperation and communication. While the Court could not say with absolute certainty that there was an unhealthy degree of constant bickering, it could say with relative certainty that the child was affected to a varying degree by the constant bicker. 2)The petitioner was ordered to have regular access with the respondent every second week and reasonable phone access during winter periods.  3)Interim custody was ordered for the child in the amount of $125 per month. Child care costs were to be determined based on the petitioner's income for the purposes of interim child support."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, seeking a declaration that there were were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. The Sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. They applied for costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of their costs of litigation, as concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The dispute has been acrimonious and the Sheas omitted some important detail in their claim to a right of way. Ultimately, the sheas, in omitting the important information, undermined their strength of the claim. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct."

The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000 in value contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief by damaging a motor vehicle to break and steal the computer. He was sentenced to 18 months to be served concurrently with the theft charge. He appealed his sentence on the grounds that the sentence is unfair and the mischief charge is too long. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence, that the offences constitute serious offences from which the public must be protected. The trial judge was correct when he said general deterrence must be a matter of primary concern."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant who had been standing on the property with him and had been advised not to come upon the property by the complainant. The confrontation continued and the defendant's shovel was used to pick up the complainant's shovel and the complainant subsequently struck the accused in the rib cage area with his fist. The complainant's argument that the accused had a knife was not supported by the evidence as it was not a knife. The defence introduced testimony from the accused's uncle who testified that he had seen the accused make the allegation of theft and that the knife was in the accused’s hand. The accused argued that the uncle had told the complainant to stay off his property and that he did not intend to use the knife. Accused found guilty of aggravated assault, assault, by wounding the complainant and possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. Although the accused denied having a knife, the defence testified that the defendant indicated that he would stab the complainant if he went to the property. The Court awarded the aggravated assault conviction on the first count, and the sentence on the second count, which was the assault on the complainant where the offence occurred. The court found that the defence evidence did not support the charge of self-defence, and concluded that the trial judge had erred in concluding that the complainant had not believed the accused."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed SGI's assistance to repair the damage to the car and sought reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer took the vehicle to a repair shop for repairs and received an appraisal which assessed the damage. The repair shop did not advise the plaintiff of the damage and advised the plaintiff that it was fixing the exhaust system. The automobile was repaired by the automobile repair shop and the plaintiff paid $2,014.93 for the repairs. The owner of the vehicle claimed depreciation. SGI denied it had acknowledged the deduction and claimed reinstatement under s. 39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The claim for the loss was set aside and the insurer was not liable for the repair costs. 1)An express election is not necessary. An election under the statutory condition 8(4) of the Act amounts to an election to reinstate. In this case, the insurer elected to repair and replace the damaged motor vehicle. 2)The claim for depreciation was dismissed as not being payable within the specified period. 3)An election to repair is for the benefit of the insurer and if the insurer elects to repair, it must give the insured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. 4)The insurer was found not to be responsible for the damage as determined by the actuarial report. 5)The Court found that SGI did not elect to repair or replace the vehicle as a condition of its obligation. It was not entitled to deduction for depreciation or 'betterment'. 6)The court found that an express election was not necessary in this case. A mere offer to settle by payment of a certain sum of money will probably not of itself be an election. 7)Statutory conditions 8(3) and 7) clearly indicate that an insurer has elected to fix or replace a vehicle. However, one of the basis for finding an election in repair was the insurer's benefit and the defendant's obligation. In Lepin, the claim was for depreciation but was not payable within specified period of time. 8)The respondent was entitled to costs of the repair. 9)The issue of costs was whether SGI elected to replace or reinstate the vehicle. 10)If not, the respondent was liable for any loss or loss incurred by the insurer pursuant to the statutory conditions. 11)The test of election was determined."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner sole custody of his daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently sought joint custody with the father. The case became complicated inasmuch as each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The petitioner's father and mother each sought custody of their daughter. The Court had no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moved with her father to the Cityof Calgary."
d_2003skqb4.txt,"FIAT. The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The petitioner father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. She sought to restrict access visits to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that he has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. She remained in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The petitioner was ordered to exercise access on each occasion."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The respondent granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month for the couple's two children, Mark and Michelle. The petitioner counter-petitioned in 1992 for a division of their property. An application by the respondent to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J.on May 11, 1993. The court was of the view that a kind of specified access should be put in place. The farm home is 22 miles from the petitioner's residence. The property was purchased in 1985 for $55,000. It was further ordered that the petitioner would not transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise encumber the lands except in accordance with an order of the court and the petitioner may apply to the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment of the amount then outstanding. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The parties were discussing how it should be determined. The wife had a beneficial interest created by the order, sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the first three lands to the extent of $50,711.66. The RRSP had purchased the farm home from the respondent in 1989 and it was of interest that the land be encumbered. In the interim order, the respondent had submitted that his land be divided and that the value of the farm property be divided according to the tenor of the agreement for sale. HELD: 1)The RRSP was to pay the petitioner for the assets of the wife, the sum payable to the mother solely, plus interest atthe judgment rate of 0.5% to be accrue in the meantime. The amount payable by the mother did not include the share of Terrance's pension benefit. 2)The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission was to transfer the sum of $30,000 to an R.R.S.P. as may be prescribed by the wife. 3)The petitioner was to apply to court for an award predating the order of Osborn, J., 4)The court was satisfied that the parties had agreed upon reasonable terms upon which it can be varied downwards as the petitioner contends. The farmer's income from farming during the marriage had not resulted in a corresponding division. 4)An award for lump sum payments sought for the wife was rejected."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price. The court found that the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the defendant and entitled to claim pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff’s position was that although they had done testing of the oats for moisture content as delivered by Wlaswich, that its testing procedures were not in accordance with the Canadian Grain Commission sampling procedures and as result were not verifiable. The documents submitted by the defendant were not admitted into evidence. The issue was whether the plaintiff was required to provide the oats with a certain quality standard. HELD: There was no evidence that the defendant had adopted the contractual position that the oats were delivered to the plaintiff and not to be delivered by the plaintiff. There was nothing to show that the certifications of the parties to the contract had been adopted by the court. If the plaintiff had established that the documents were third-party hearsay documents that were being produced for the truth of their contents, he would have been entitled to a full payment for the contract. The issues were whether the court was led to believe that the company could be bound by the contractual obligations of the plaintiff, whether the documents could be considered third party documents, whether there was a risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party, if the documents had not been properly kept and if there was any evidence pointing to non-compliance, the court ordered the defendant to admit them into evidence and pay the plaintiff the balance owed to it. The defendant had failed to establish that there was no contractual obligation entered into by the petitioner that puts that risk on him. On the evidence he has complied with that obligation. There is nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had separated from the common law spouse a few days prior and had been seen by her children. She had called the accused late in the night prior to the offence and said that she did not care if she went to jail for this. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the crime, taking into account the circumstances of this offence and the requirements of denunciation and general deterrence, was a period of incarceration of 2 years and 8 months, the total being 30 months. Under s.100(1), the criminal code was ordered that you not have in your possession any firearms, ammunition, or explosive substance for a 10 year period."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing the respondent's obligations under the CAP. Each party has made an application for directions for directions. The respondent, which is not seeking leave, applies to have the Chief Judge of the CAP refer to its legal fees and disbursements as a comprehensive database for verification. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the respondent to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable.

The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear. The appeal was allowed with respect to the action against the Board and the individual members, apart from the Chair.","The appellant applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike out the respondent's statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appellant states that the actions of the Board, and of the personal defendants who participated in the decisions leading to the orders, were an attempt to stonewall the appellant from uncovering and making public that the principal of the plaintiff and that he was alleged to have an anti-union attitude. The appellants subsequently brought an application for certiorari to the Supreme Court to quash the Board's orders and its decision to refuse leave to apply for reconsideration. The Chambers judge dismissed the application for leave to appeal. He found that the appellants, who had been on the Board since 1971, had the proper jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry and to submit a report. The respondent, which had been granted leave to intervene in the Trade Union Act litigation, also brought an action for breach of s.2(d) of the Charter. This action was also brought under s.13(1)(a) the Dominion Act. In this action, the appellant alleged that the respondent, as chairman of the board, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was committing acts of bad faith, which amounted to breach of his or her statutory responsibility. The action was brought under the interlocutory decision of the Chambers judge. In his decision, the Supreme court held that the Chambers Judge erred in finding that the issue of Crown immunity determined on a preliminary application under the Rule. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. 1)The Chambers judge did not err in his determination that the statements of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. 2)The appellants had no grounds to challenge the decision in this action. 3)There was no question in the case at large that appellants (and indeed the appellant) had the necessary jurisdiction and to bring an application pursuant to s.14.25(1(a) to compel the appellant to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things which the Board deems requisite to the full investigation of any matter within its jurisdiction. 4)The appellant was awarded judgment for $250,000 as exemplary damages."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with knowingly uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children had recently passed away and the family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to the estate. The daughter and son-in-law of the accused claimed that the accused had told them that if they brought the police out, they would blow up the farm and the house in plastic bags. The son- in-law claimed that this was all that the alleged threat would do. Accused's lawyer objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all counts. The Court held that it would be improper for the accused to make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. It was always open to the Accused to make an application and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In a non-jury trial, the Court would look charily at admitting such convictions or giving them any probative weight whatever. There was no need for the defence to introduce any new evidence. The evidence would have to be put before the trier of fact in order to get the ruling."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  They argued that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. They also claimed that the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable, and that, since they did not apply to public reserve land, they should not be prosecuted for trespass. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were found not guilty of all charges.  2) There was no evidence that the defendants, or anyone who wished to do anything on a public reserve, such as a boat house, to comply with the zoning bylaws. 3) The evidence did not suggest that they intended to offend the public. Rather, they simply took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. The Municipality stepped into that position. It could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the Province had to be obtained if their zoning by laws did apply, in law, to public reserves. In any event, the Municipality had set up a situation whereby it created public reserves in front of cottage lot owners, the very people most likely to see themselves as justified in encroaching on public reserves, and required them to do it at the expenseof their ratepayers the cottage owners themselves. In the event of widespread violations, great expense and controversy was predictable. The real question was whether any given council chose to act out of respect for law, or pressures to enforce s. 197, or not."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff suffered injuries caused by the defendant. HELD: The Court held that the defendant was not qualified to give an opinion as to causation of the damage to the plaintiffs' back as it was not known at the time of the collision if the evidence was not present. The Court sought to resolve the issue of causation by having the medical doctor answer the following question:Did the motor car accident cause or contribute to any of the plaintiffs injuries or damage?  1)The evidence was inconclusive as to the cause of the pain. 2)The court was unable to accept the expert's opinion regarding the cause as causation. 3)The medical doctor was not trained in the field of biomechanics. His expertise as a mechanical engineer was limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports. He had not reviewed the collision in detail nor has he read or studied in the area of the causation of injuries in low velocity rear-end collisions. 4)The pain and discomfort experienced by the plaintiff relate to pre-existing conditions and not to the collision."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual activity with respect to her 8-year-old son. The accused was found in possession of a laptop computer and several pictures were found on a computer monitor. The search was conducted after the accused was separated from her husband and engaged in a matrimonial dispute. The computer monitor was located on the premises and the search warrant was issued. At no time during the search did the accused or her son have access to the computer or the monitor or any other electronic device capable of storing pictures of the alleged offence. The court reviewed the ITO and found that the information obtained was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The Court concluded that the use of the computer by the police was a breach of the accused's Charter rights and that it could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits. HELD: The plaintiff’S cause of action was as a result of the defendant’d negligence in naming the fund as a beneficiary. Garry Mayer had cause of Action as a disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as a consequence of the negligence. The claim against the defendant was dismissed. 1)The defendant was not a chartered life insurance company and the fact that the deceased purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom in 1993 naming Garry as its beneficiary gave rise to the same considerations as occur in disappointed beneficiary cases such as Wilhelm v. Hickson. Although the disappointed beneficiary principle has usually arisen and may well usually arise in the context of solicitors and will preparation, this “disappointed beneficiary” principle is not function merely of a defendant”s occupation. The defendants’ negligence was similar. 2)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity, namely $34,250.55, for pre-judgment interest from the date of death of the deceased to the Date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed. 3)The claim against Dataplan was dismissed as there was no evidence that the defendant had any application in that they were not solicitors providing investment services and were not providing financial advice or providing specific instruction or instruction to the deceased as a principal beneficiary. The deceased had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant that the realization of the Mayer’�s intent to benefit Garry was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by Nordstrom are frequently used as estate planning tools why else would there be beneficiary designation? The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the third party, the plaintiff, would bear the loss. To this case, the situation is analogous to that which occurred in Wilhelm v.'s Hickson (2000), 189 Sask. R. 71 (C.A.). 4)As it was represented concurrently with Nordstrom, there shall be no order as to costs for or against it"
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The second child, aged 18, decided not to go to university that fall and the respondent ceased paying support for him. The parties both worked part-time and had student loans. When he was approximately $450 short of the amount required for his books and other university costs, the petitioner paid $1,000 per month based upon his income of approximately $80k. The respondent's income in 2000 was $3,543.56, but in 2001 it was estimated at $18,000. The petitioner's direct food and shelter related expenses were $18000 per annum out of total living expenses, exclusive of source deductions of $30,000, and the petitioner's arrears were set at $718 per month. HELD: In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrenars only for the support of the two children pursuant to the Table amount of support and to assume their proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans, the Court found that it was not inappropriate to determine the respondent's child support obligation in accordance with s. 3(2)(a).  1) The children were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and had the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school. 2) The mother was attending university and was able to support herself and her two children. She was attending a university education. The father was working part time. The children of the marriage were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post -secondary education. Their needs were met. 3) The respondent was responsible for most of the expenses for the children. The mother's income was reasonably foreseeable at the time that she was leaving university and had no means of contributing to her own expenses. She had employment when she was unable to work full-time. The husband was responsible only for a small amount of the children's expenses. The Table amount was calculated based on the full extent of the father's obligation and determined presumptively, irrespective of the mother's actual needs. 4) The Court was satisfied that in the circumstance at hand and the demonstrated ability of the child to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they are not dependent on their parents for the purposes of s"
d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons.

The public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm which has been done to them. 4) With respect to costs, the Court referred to the two part test set out by Dagenaises, [1994][1994] and Mentuck [2001] to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and, the positive effects on the rights and interests of the parties and public, including, the right to free expression."
c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy just debt. The defendant in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The certified cheq did not constitute a just debt as the defendants had already received payment for their services. The plaintiff's statement of claim discloses a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. It is the result in Barclays Bank v. Simms that the payee in Canada seeks to avoid by having the cheque certified. HELD: The motion must be dismissed as the plaintiff’s statement of claims adequately discloses the cause of actions in mistakeof fact/ unjust enrichment. While the plaintiff may only look at the notice of motion, the attached statement of Claim and any document which is referred to in the claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of the claim, the court must assume that all the allegations in the plaintiffs statement are true and that there is a cause for action in any event, including one involving a mistake in law. The statements of claim disclosed a cause that the defendant intended to take advantage of an innocent mistake on the part of a bank employee. The court must therefore assume that the delay in bringing the application to trial is not a factor."

In finding Ripley guilty on charges (v) of conduct unbecoming a senior officer of an investment dealer and (vi) of breach of a by-law (c) which established that the rules of natural justice applied to such a profession, the court found that the application of the by-laws did not lie with Ripley as he was not the officer who should be held responsible on the remaining charges. The panel's findings were squarely within the duty and jurisdiction of the disciplinary board."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. The court was satisfied that special circumstances existed permitting further examination and/or questioning of the defendant in connection with the plaintiff's application. The Court ordered that the plaintiffs should provide full and complete responses to written interrogatories and, if necessary, be orally examined on their responses. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that it is plain and obvious pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules that the plaintiff does not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages. The plaintiffs have been required to respond to numerous quality assurance requests by any professional body relating to the plaintiff’s surgery. In addition to pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, the plaintiff has been extensively examined relating to his training, experience, techniques and procedures."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The access issue has come before the Court twice. In February 2007 the Court issued a fiat that specified custody and access for two weeks followed by one week off. In April it ordered that the petitioner have access. In May it was revealed that the respondent would be laid off for two months in the spring. This was not in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order. The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. The request to specify access this summer is in the form of an extension of the original order. HELD: 1) The Court found no evidence that there had been a material change in circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. 2) Application to alter interim access orders is not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is not an option. The court will find that there was a significant amount of animosity between the parties and will not grant an order which would increase the petitioner's regular access. Granting specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period of time."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application to strike the claim against SMI is based on the fact that the plaintiffs are Policy holders of the defendant SMI and this policy does not cover the type of loss sustained by the Plaintiffs. 2) The Court found that a breach of the plaintiff's duty to act fairly and in good faith would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of the claimed against the third party defendants. 3) Each act was done by the person or persons therein alleged on behalf of himself or themselves and their co-conspirators in furtherance of the said conspiracy to defraud. The duty to pay promptly as a component of the duty of Good faith does not give rise to an absolute obligation giving rise to a automatic claim for consequential damages in the event of any failure to make timely payment to the plaintiff."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all of the counts. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The court found that the officer did not knock on the door for the purpose of securing evidence for a crime, but rather because she was concerned that perhaps this person was out driving around with a young child in the backseat. The officer”s accompanying her around the house and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. The accused” s.8 Charter breach” was serious. It was found that as long as the evidence of impairment established beyond reasonable doubt, any degree of impairment ranging from slight to great the offence was made out. There was no evidence of driving at all and the officer had no lawful authority to conduct search at the entrance to the house nor to enter the house without permission. Therefore the accused was not found guilty. The voir dire was voided."
2_2007skqb296.txt,"FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided. HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group. The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","FIAT: The plaintiff brings a class action against nine defendants. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants were involved in the divestiture of assets by the Walbaum Group. The defendants are equal partners in the defendant. The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, the defendant was ordered liquidated. Thereafter, the main defendant carried on business as the sole shareholder of the defendant, Dwayne Walbaum. The principal allegation against him is that during 1996 and 1997 while he was solely in charge of Dun-Rite Plumbing, he diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies (All-rite Plumbing and Tamwal Investments) and his wife. Each applies for an order severing or staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs have been heard and decided. HELD: 1) The claims against the defendants play a small part in the larger action against the Walbbaum Group and the facts surrounding the plaintiffs' claim against the group are different from the facts supporting the claims. The legal issues surrounding the claims are different. Legal considerations will determine whether the plaintiffs should be relieved of their obligations to attend portions of the trial in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 2) The plaintiffs are entitled to severance if they elect to. 3) The court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether the grant an application for severance. In this case the plaintiffs are not precluded from adducing evidence related to the walbaum Group's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend any portion of trial in respect of the Walba Group in any case, severances would not result in the significant saving. 4) Orders under Rule 41(a) are not confined to severances or stays of proceedings. Other options are available to ensure that all issues are tried in a manner that minimizes unnecessary prejudice and expense to all parties."
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel which reinstated the respondent as an employee following his termination as anemployee in 1993. The respondent took the position that the 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident as it took into account his involvement in a difficult divorce proceeding, his former employment record, and that the respondent's years of seniority and previous disciplinary record. HELD: 1)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was correct. The standard of review is one of correctness. 2)The respondent took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and conclude that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment record the final incident justified termination of his employment. 3)The penalty of discharge was excessive, especially when coupled with the respondent veteran's years and previous record. 4)The applicant took issue at the Board's decision to not apply the principle of culminating effect which was applied to the respondent. 5)The board was not prepared to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident constituted a culminating event as taking into account the respondent and his family's absence from work in 1993 and his previous employment record constituted the appropriate penalty for discharge. 6)The suspension without pay for 16 months was not discharge."

The applicant seeks an order from the Court terminating his obligations for payment and that the respondent will keep the applicant informed of all communications received from the CPP disability claims administrators and provide copies of such correspondence to him immediately upon receipt. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The applicant has not met the threshold obligation to satisfy the Court that there is a material change in circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payor’s obligation to pay child or spousal support.  2) It may well be the case that from and after his mandatory retirement, which is scarcely two years away, his circumstances including the substantial decrease in his income from the current level of approximately $67,000, may well constitute material change that prompting yet another variation application at that time. It may also be that Elizabeth will have completed her first degree. In addition, Mr. Reid advises he is prepared to fully support Ms. Ellis-Reid’'s eligibility to apply for and obtain a split of Mr.”s CPP credits.  3) In the circumstances, the applicant may well find herself unable to work and may even decide to reapply for child support.

Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","HELD: The court held that it did not believe that the respondent had the existing ability to pay child support.

6_1991canlii4510.txt,"This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit. For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title had been open, notorious and continuous possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property, and they had established a good and marketable possessory ownership there. After the death of their only child, who was at that time an elderly woman, they proceeded to build a large garden on the lot adjacent to their church property. The church property was extensively destroyed by the Halifax Explosion. After their death, their only remaining property was a modest one, which they continued to use for their day care and school. The garden was tended to and maintained by their children. Although it was clear from the evidence that the family had been maintaining a home for the past 40 years, the evidence suggested that their possession had been exercised since at least 1938 when the 15' strip was transferred from the Bond daughters to the sisters. The missing frontage bears on that residence lot rather than on the property. Objection to title sought by the Crown on behalf of the purchasers/partners in title was that even if a find of possessory titles had been established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years this would not, under the Limitation of Actions Act, defeat a claim by them under the Escheats Act against whom such possession must be proved for a period of at least 60 years."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied for a remand for assessment pursuant to section 752.1 of the Code, as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the evidence concerning attempts made to control the offender’s behaviour in the community and the expert who testified at the trial who had been qualified to provide the necessary assessment. The matter was adjourned to permit the expert to complete his assessment. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that on an application to have an offender declared dangerous offender, the Court must first consider whether the subject of the application might be a long-term offender, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in s.753 have been met. The Court proposed to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the code in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Courtof Appeal, and given the unusual nature of this sentencing procedure. The statutory requirements for finding that an offender is a dangerous person are set out in s753.1(c). There must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated. This is especially true in borderline cases, where the offender does not suffer from an inherent defect of character or reason and seems to have been living an appropriate life. The standard is not whether cure is guaranteed but whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control in society."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that the issues were with respect to the interpretation of the priority agreements between the parties and to the Interpretation of s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act and whether the respondent was obliged to pay certain amounts to the receiver as set out in the trustee's report and to whether the third party suppliers were obliged to supply certain parts of the plaintiff's product with personal guarantees from two individuals rather than the usual three-part security offered by the respondent and in respect of parts and supplies for the plaintiff. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the respondent to refuse to restock direct ship parts. The Court rejected the appellant's argument that the goods/parts issue was the cornerstone of the Priority Agreement and that the vendors were acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. The court found that the respondent's obligation to repurchase and to pay the receiver was not the same as the receiver seeking to change priorities as between the respective claimants.

They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded.

c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had been employed for 5 years at the time of his employment and had recently acquired equipment and claimed capital cost allowance in lieu of renting equipment. HELD: 1)The father's income from 1995 to the current date is determined to be $27,600. The mother has set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claim for gas and repairs is significantly higher than in previous years and no explanation is offered. The capital costs allowance is not patently unreasonable. 2)The farm income will be adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowances for this year. The farm income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. There is no evidence why the child attends high school there, why the expense isnecessary in relation to the child's best interests or whether the child has any means to contribute to the expense. 3)The expenses are overstated by $3,000 in comparison to the three previous taxation years. There are $2,233 in capital payments ($2,232 for one horse) and $1,233 for a pound of beef which is the step child's pet. 4)The claim was refused but with leave to return the issue to the Court with appropriate supporting materials."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act but then amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s.(23) and (37) an order for the parties to remain together as a family to the extent possible. The father had agreed to a shorter term order in which he agreed to have reasonable access on reasonable notice to each of his children. HELD: Each child in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b) was placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they can return to their parent, placed with a person of adequate interest, in the event circumstances change. The Agency will make the orders requested. 1)Each child was identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity.  2)The Agency did not participate in the protection hearings. The reasonableness for not making the orders sought was because the Agency had no other option."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to the Divorce Act. In L.S. v. E.P., the Court held that the circumstances leading to the child support award had not changed. The parties' incomes were similar to what they had been in 1992 and the children continued to spend a substantial portion of their time with their mother. This was done even though the payor had no notice of the claim. 2) Retroactive support is not the same as ongoing support. It is the norm in awarding retroactive support. The British Columbia Court of Appeal set out a non-exhaustive list of factors that may militate for or against retroactive child support. 3) There is a presumption in favour of retroactive (or retroactive) support based on the principles set out in the Guidelines. The Court prefers the approach taken by the British Columbia court of Appeal. 4) The Alberta court of appeal disagreed with many of the factors. This is not surprising given its 'presumptive approach'. Parents of children cannot be compared to debtors and creditors. Their relationships are far more complex and personally intertwined. The fact these agreements have not been put in place does not impose on those that pay support a mandatory obligation to do the recalculation themselves."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that he was looking for any additional labels, paint colour changes or information that might confirm or refute the vehicle's true owner and identity. 2) The evidence was not excluded under s. 24(2). The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s of the charter was infringed when he was detained in his police car. The Court found that the accused had not observed any signs of gross or gross impairment, had smelled cigarette smoke but no alcohol, and that he had not confirmed the registration documents against the vehicle identification number (VIN) to confirm 'the true identity of the vehicle'.  3) The police conducted a secondary search of the motor home which included searching the vehicle and obtaining evidence. The motor home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana and two bundles of $20 bills. The accused stated that he understood that he wanted to speak to a lawyer. The police officer asked the accused if he had any more documents pertaining to the vehicle. He said that the certificate containing the VIN number for the motorhome was located in a closet. That number matched the number on the dash plate of the car. He then opened some exterior panels to look at the license and registration that had been produced by the accused and his parents. He also noted that two plastic bags containing bricks of cocaine had been found in the trunk of the truck. The RCMP officer then used a mobile work station to conduct a traffic stop. The vehicles were stopped within a few kilometres of each other. The mobile workstation was used to conduct surveillance of vehicles. During the course of the search, the police officers observed numerous vehicles being searched and noticed that there was a noticeable difference in the smell of marijuana, blood pressure, and blood"

He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.

Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.

The plaintiff had an accident while swimming in the Lake Placid. While in the hospital, he experienced chest pains and discomfort. Four days later, while in class, he had another one. He had to remain within 15 minutes of the Chicago airport for 15 minutes to continue his studies. Two doctors treated Hurd for pneumothsorax and sent him on his way to Chicago to continuehis studies. Neither doctor detected or made mention that they even suspected bleb as the underlying cause of the condition. Hurd was unable, however, to return home to Saskatchewan because of the pneumothoria.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The children were placed in the custody of the Minister until they turned the age of 18 years, which would be until the following year. If the children were found to be children in need of protection, an order under s. 11 of the Act would be made respecting each child pursuant to that order. The Minister did not refer to the evidence in this regard. The evidence focused on the mother's change from being hostile to the father to being an advocate for the children."

HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant step-father pled guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting the plaintiff. He was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, subsequently reduced on appeal to six months. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. The defendant did not defend the action.HELD: 1)The plaintiff's non-pecuniary loss was attributable solely to her sexual assault by her uncle. 2)The evidence was adduced that the plaintiff incurred direct pecuniary losses as result of her sexual assaults, even to the extent of the cost to her further education. 3)The scientific approach to assessing the damages must be utilized to assess the compensation required to provide the injured person with reasonable solace. In most personal injury cases the loss to the plaintiff is caused by the negligence of the defendant. An award of aggravated damages is therefore rarely even considered. But when the claim is founded on sexual assault, the damage inflicted is deliberate. The greater portion of the damage is attributable to the actions of the uncle. 4)The court determined that the discrepancies between the amounts awarded by various courts in sexual assault cases could not be reconciled. The primary issue was the subjective appraisals of damages intended to compensate the victim for her loss of self-esteem and the psychological trauma and emotional distress that she had undergone. Damages were to be determined based on the totality of the damages."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: 1) It is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver’s license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. 2) The evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty. 3) The principles in McKenzie are based on the principles of R. v. Prue (1979) (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.C.; 1 A.D.A.; and 2) It was apparent from the Driver History, which has been filed by the Crown, that his S. G.I./Institute driving record since the year 2000 includes numerous entries for motor vehicle accidents, summary offence tickets, and other administrative actions by S.Gs.I., which have, on occasion, resulted in the disqualification of his driving privileges for varying lengths of time. The case at bar involves a charge under the Saskatchewan Highway Traffic act, as opposed to the Criminal Code. However, in the Prue decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that there is a presumption against strict liability offences, and in favour of some element of mens rea or criminal intent. As a result, do not believe this is a strict liability offence. Rather, believe that some mens ra must be established. This accused was acquitted of all charges. It is therefore necessary to assess the credibility of witnesses who testified in the context of whether the evidence is sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the accused committed the offence as alleged. The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The determination of credibility does not involve the court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather the court must prove that its evidence is credible and there is no onus on the accused to establish a new standard of conduct. 3)'Solemly negligent driving"
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by a vehicle driven by the insured. The insured insured for the plaintiff limited her income to $140 per week for 129 weeks. She commenced an action against the insured and the insurer of the plaintiff's vehicle pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy, alleging that the insurance company had failed to provide proper documentation of her employment at the time of the accident. The insurance company sued the plaintiff and her insurer, Guardian, claiming that the plaintiff was not employed at the date of the incident, and that she had not shown any interest in claiming repayment of the money paid to her by the defendant until after the accident, when she testified that she would have to pay the money back. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's claim against the insurance companies was dismissed. 2)The court found that the defendant had acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation on the basis of the representations put forward by the plaintiff to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be in the interest of the court to prevent the plaintiff from obtaining unemployment insurance when it was found that her benefits were paid based on faulty information provided by the insurer. 3)Although the plaintiff had stated that she did not work in the insurance business, her testimony at trial was contradictory. She testified that her only employment was as a bookkeeper. She had not made any money doing bookkeeping or bookkeeping, and had only received one income check for $140.00 per week. She did not appear to have worked any part-time job. 4)The insurance companies were ordered to pay costs to the plaintiff. 5)Costs were ordered on the plaintiff for the duration of the action.  6)Each party was entitled to costs in their own right. 7)The defendant was ordered to make weekly payments for the period of 48 hours to the applicant's failure to indicate interest in seeking repayment."
d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, had been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison for child abuse and had been unable to parent because of the paternal grandmother's lack of contact with the child. The father, who is a convicted child abuser, had placed the child in the permanent care and custody of R.S., who lives in the Halifax Regional Municipality, with the consent of her step-sister, who has since been moved to a larger residence. Both parties were very uncooperative with the agency and it was clear neither was willing to work with assistance towards learning sufficient parenting skills. HELD: The mother's application for custody was dismissed. The court found that the child was in need of protection and that it would be in the best interest of the child to have it placed with a person other than a parent or guardian who would provide supervised access to both parents on a frequent and regular basis. The paternal grandmother was 66 years old and lives with her maternal grandmother in Halifax. She is better set up in her home to receive the child and is more financially stable. The maternal grandmother indicated that she would move to a bigger residence if she got custody."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant appealed the May 31, 1999 probate decision dismissing his application to have costs to be awarded on solicitor and client basis. The appellant had practised law for in excess of 40 years before retirement and had made a number of specific bequests, including a bequest of $50,000 to her niece and $10,000 for the Zion Lutheran Church. Dorothy Crouse, widow of the appellant appointed the appellant, sole executor of her estate, in September 1995. She died in September 1997. At her request, the Acting Registrar of Probate ordered all estate money be paid into an estate bank account. Counsel for the two respondents requested costs on this appeal on a solicitor/client scale, fixed and payable forthwith. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs as well as directing the registrar to confiscate the appellant's estate file and thus hampering him in his further work on the estate. 1) This appeal was brought for the sole purpose of delaying the legatees from pursuing their legitimate rights. As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process. 2) There was no merit in any of the grounds advanced by the appeal. The Court found that the appellant had converted the funds of the estate to his own use and that he was completely justified in ordering his executor's file be delivered to the court. The appeal denied that the appellants had committed a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed by him as executor. 3) The appellant was entitled to view the contents of the file, in the presence of the acting Registrar or his appointee, and would be entitled to receive copies of any materials in the file."

The landlord states that he never agreed to pay the utilities.HELD: Pursuant to s. 72 of The residential Tenancies Act, the court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction. The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings. It is not open to this court to overturn those findings of fact. The appeal is dismissed.","The landlord appealed a decision of a Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies ordering the landlord to pay the tenant $787.13, of which $562.13 represents utilities that the Hearing Officer found the tenant had overpaid and $225 was ordered to be paid as abatement of rent for the tenant's inconvenience of having to deal with the caretaker's threats of the water being turned off and for repeated notes from the caretakers. The landlord argued the hearing officer erred in her decision on the facts. HELD: The Court is statutorily restricted to addressing questions of law or of jurisdiction.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants were living in the plaintiff's home with their wife and children. The plaintiff claims that the defendant signed the cheque and returned it, with the return of the $960 being a deduction from his December cheque. The issue of damages is whether there was a loan of $1 million, as there was no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation. The defendant testified that he received the money in a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was never request to pay it back earlier. The claim that the defendants asked the plaintiff to pay back the $5k000 and the $1k000 were never proven. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. There is no evidence to support the conclusion that the $2,000 was a gift from the defendant to the plaintiffs. 2) The defendant's counterclaim is not proven. 3) The defendants had the free use of the defendant's home and the defendants' car whenever they needed it. There was no basis to withhold the money from the plaintiff on the last cheque as there is no substance to the money filed by the defendant with respect to wages and vacation pay. 4) The $5K000 cheque was never given to the defendant. The statements of claim filed as exhibits do not show the money was actually paid back. The balance of probabilities are not satisfied. 5) The claim for wages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the plaintiff if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. If she is not able to obtain the payments that she lost, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiffs to Lilia.  6) Lilia's claim was adjourned."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. At the request of this Court, Ms. B. appeared by telephone to give evidence with regard to her claims for undue hardship, s. expenses and retroactive child support based on undue hardship. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of their only child. The respondent has four other children and has been unemployed for three months. HELD: 1) Section expenses are referred to as “add ons” to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. 2) The Court must determine whether the parent is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The facts in this case do not support the imputation of income. The Court cannot impute income to the respondent on the basis he is intentionally over-employed. The onus is on the party applying under s. 10 to establish undue hardship; it will not be presumed simply because the applicant has the legal responsibility for another child or children and/or because the standard of living of the applicant's household is lower than that of the other spouse. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship in the circumstances. 3) Income is not imputed to the parties. The only issue is whether the Court can impute it pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines on the onus to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or intentional. The Parties' financial situations do not warrant such a finding. 4) The court must establish that her standard of doing business is less than half of what it was before the Federal Child Support Guidelines were introduced. 5) The parties' income is limited by his health, his education, skills and physical limitations. Given his current income is below the amount normally required for Table support, no support shall be ordered at this time."

The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VERT) Regulations (Reg. 10) and a fine of $350 for operating a vehicle with after-market tinted side windows. The police had tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty as charged. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on his behalf on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. The Crown was given an opportunity to file written argument on the sufficiency issue. Standard of review is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. The appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed. The charge, as drafted, is a nullity. It is not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect. The Court will not intervene if the appeal becomes nullity or the fine is imposed."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgement, or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The respondent may satisfy the judgment by way of rollover to satisfy the Equalization payment. Negotiations are not relevant. The respondent has not proven that the agreement was binding. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order. 2) With the benefit of this blunt and unambiguous opinion from the Court of Appeal, the parties were unable to resolve the matter themselves. It is not appropriate to issue a judgment on this issue within the meaning of the law. 3) The dispute arises because the wife says she is entitled to $105,000 net in cash or cash equivalents with at least $65,000 being the cash composition. She says this is what the husband said he could borrow. She was not aware the husband had significant RRSPs. 4) The parties are required to pay $25,000 in equalization to the respondent and $15,000 to the equalizer. The Court ordered that the respondent pay $5,000 per month in equalized installments to the wife for the next four years. This amount will be divided equally. 5) The Court acknowledged that the wife walked away with an equal net worth of the family property. It would be a tragedy if these people would have to litigate this further because they are paying lawyers large sums of money which would quickly eat up the tax payable on the rollover or trial dates. No costs were ordered."
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident. He was treated at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital by a doctor with an advanced medical knowledge and skills. During the course of the action, the plaintiff suffered a serious neck injury and was unable to move his legs. He came under the care of the doctor who instituted cervical traction to reduce the spinous dislocation, process that brought the spine into reasonable alignment. The plaintiff's wife was also a party by virtue of her cross-claim against the doctor and his application to strike the plaintiff's action. At trial, the court will consider whether the medical evidence is sufficiently complex and scientific to warrant a trial by a jury; whether the doctor's expert opinion should be considered in light of the complexity of the evidence; whether it should be appealed to a judge and/or jury; if not, whether the application should be allowed. The court reviewed the various appraisals of property and the nature of the medical and actuarial evidence available and concluded that a jury would be capable of understanding the issues.

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser-Brace and required them to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. Hartford sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not responsible for the policy. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian was therefore not liable. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. The appellant had no obligation to pay the fire loss as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was neverAt Risk for Fire Loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or Fraser- Brace for causing the fire. In this case Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. The Guardian policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. The policy was never issued to the insured and the Guardian was never required to contribute. Furthermore, there was no contractual relationship between Guardian and the Province, nor between the parties and Guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the loss suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while unlawfully possessing a narcotic and contrary to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, and unlawfully cultivating marijuana. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The accused was asked where he was going and what was in the back of the van. HELD: 1) The officer had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession of the accused. 2) The accused did not require a warrant as he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the plants were in his possession. 3) The police officer was on call. There were no officers in the RCMP detachment that day. The officer was not conducting a search of the vehicle when the accused pulled up to the rental van in an investigative mode. The conversation between the accused and the officer was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case against the accused pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter. The police did not suggest that prior to the information provided by the accused that there was either reasonable or probable grounds nor any articuable cause for detention. The Crown did acknowledge that one of the pockets in the van was bulging and asked the accused if he would empty his pockets. 4) Counsel was satisfied that even if the question 'where are you going' was innocuous social conversation, that it was fishing to see what answer he got. There can be no other explanation for the question. The question has nothing to do with determining whether the accused required any assistance."

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts.

The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

Both held their property by deeds obtained at tax sales. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title to the land and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from using said lands. The meaning of the word interval in describing lands in North America was discussed.","In a reserved decision, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title under the Act to certain lands including the six acre portion in dispute and to a permanent injunction restraining the appellant and her assigns from using the said lands in any way whatsoever. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the evidence more than supported the decision of the trial court. The trial judge relied on the deed to himself and to his predecessors in title and claimed title to the 73-acre parcel of land and to six acres of meadowland in dispute. The respondent did not dispute that he had given the land to his son. The evidence showed that the division of the disputed lands was a straight line division and the acreage shortfall sustained by the appellant was due to the bend in the river."
b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant and her sister both testified at trial that they had not experienced sexual intercourse prior to the accused being in custody. The accused was acquitted on both charges.HELD: The Court found that the accused was wrong to believe the complainant's evidence when he told the Court that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night in question, that he did not go to K.S.'s bedroom or to her sister's house, and that his sister did not have contact with her. It was entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt. The Court also found that there were no errors in the test which was provided in R. v. W.D. [2010] 1.5."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for the use of a 'Director Tax Services Office' when the duties of the Director are performed by the Department. The Director Tax Services should not have been convicted of an offence allegedly contrary to s. 330 of the act when the information set out an offence contrary to ss. 326 of the Code. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the ACT. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment of no importance. The appellants had filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents filed. The demand for a return filed was not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the Certificate of Registration was not issued by the Director Taxation. The Certificate of Validation was issued under the Interpretation Act. HELD: The appeal was refused. 1)Section 326(13) of the Income Tax Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. The person is charged as though he committed the offence and the Crown is not required to stipulate precisely whether he committed that offence as principal or party. 2)The Court could find no error in finding no error. The certificate of registration was not a complete answer to the argument advanced by the appellants. 3)The service of a demand to file a GST return upon a business operation in the City of Regina is clearly an appropriate act to be performed by a Director of the Regina Tax Services. It was open to the court to find that the Chief of Verifications and Collections was not authorized by the Income tax Act when the Information set out such an offence. 4)There was no evidence to support the appellant's contention that the returns purportedly filed were defective but not qualify for a fair trial. The appellant's claim that the notice was signed by some person authorized to sign is not supported by the evidence. 5)The Certificate of Disclosure was not an issue in this case. The Court was not seeking to determine the adequacy of the Certificate for compliance with the relevant statutory requirements. 6)The certificate of claim was not filed. 7)The appellant had no claim to the right to rely on the signature of a director.
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and the separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff. The plaintiffs claim they have not paid assessments since 1994 and that the cause thereof was a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments. The defendants have referred to judgment of this Court in support of their allegation that if the resolutions authorizing the assessments do not also contain resolutions authorized the plaintiffs to recover interest and solicitor/client costs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to do so. They have also referred to a judgment of the Court in Support of the Defendant's allegation that a resolutions authorizing interest on unpaid assessments and solicitor and client costs do not contain resolutions authorizing them to charge the plaintiffs. HELD: The application of the plaintiffs was bedismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The issues raised do not appear susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis and certainly not on a summary basis. 2)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. 2)A reasonably serene environment is still possible in Saskatoon despite the fact that media reports regarding the offence and related acts of violence have caused concern in the community. However, a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the Court is satisfied that a fair and impartial trial can be held in any location. 3)Pre-trial publicity is not alone in allowing public bias to prejudge an accused's right to a fair trial. In the circumstances, despite the media reports, there is still a reasonably calm environment for trial. The majority of media reports are over a year old. There is no evidence that the media has created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. The pictures of the victim and memorials to him were found to be of people directly interested in the outcome after the trial. These individuals and organizations were prepared to share with the accused the names of those who donated to the memorial fund so that they could be aware if any of the donors were on the jury panel and could therefore challenge their participation if they, in fact, were selected. This cooperation is important because it could serve as a catalyst for change in venue. 4)The court reviewed the circumstances of R. v. Munson (2001), wherein it was held that a change to venue would be ordered in view of the ongoing negative publicity regarding the accused. The Court was satisfied that the pre- trial publicity did not prejudge the accused's ability to have a fair, impartial trial."
3_1994canlii3972.txt,"After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs. At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old appellant pled guilty to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm following an argument with his girlfriend. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently. He suffered a broken arm and an undisplaced pelvic fracture and fractured ribs, and two fractures to his cervical spine. He also had five previous motor vehicle accidents and three infractions involving the use of motor vehicle. The three convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law, which was demonstrated in the actions at issue. The appeal was dismissed. The sentence imposed was not based on the circumstances of the offence but on the recommendations of a Crown counsel. The Crown had not opposed the sentence in the intermittent range."
6_2006nsca89.txt,"Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to the Supreme Court to renew the application. The Supreme Court declined to do so. It is not appropriate in the circumstances to answer that question without giving the proposed new defendant an opportunity to be heard."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and in that judgment, a new verdict was ordered. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a new Trial was ordered and that it was from that judgment that this appeal arose. The Queen’s Bench judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s 213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The appellant was not adding the need for specific conversation. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. The Court also held that if the Provincial court judge had found that under s.213 the s.8 reus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. HELD: The Court found that the accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of The Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure.  1) The officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and, in the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this case, the trial was unfair in a way that the Court was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or through exclusion. 2) The second disclosure concern, related to the undisclosed bottom portion of the Checksheet, stands in different light. In this trial, the officer did know the full content of the Operational Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document, Cst. Pshyk. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in that original document, under the heading Observations on Subject, I am satisfied that Mr. Moore would not have challenged Cst.'Pshyk on his failure to made mention that the appellant's speech was slurred. That is because, had he known the full contents of the original check sheet, he would have known that such a question would inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in the case.  3) The lack of disclosure on what was a critical point in the trial and the time at which this failure was discovered rendered this trial to be unfair in the way it was not remedied by an indefinite adjournment or disclosure order. The officer was not asked to answer any question as to the correctness of the probity of the report or the adequacy of the disclosure. The Crown lawyer referred to the original Checksheet during the Crown's case and introduced it into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence.  4) The Crown did not provide full disclosure to the court. The Court was satisfied that the officer was asked to make available the full extent of the information requested by the Crown in its response to the charge and subsequent re-"
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. The Chambers judge did not meet the three tests set out in s. 25(1)(a) and s. 2(b) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and neither she nor the applicant applied to strike the stay or to dismiss the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court will accept the appeal of the director's application on the basis of the issues of estoppel and collateral attack.  1) There is no evidence that the Director attempted to abuse the process by attempting to circumvent the Court's inherent jurisdiction or that the Chambers judge erred in finding there was no abuse of processes. 2) There are a number of situations in which the Court can only hear an appeal of a decision which is part of an application under Part II of the SCAN. In this case, the issue is not whether the judge applied the rules set out on the Rules of the Bench, but rather whether she erred by failing to do so. The Court will not deal with this issue head-on. 3) The Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to s. 3 of the Act."
9_2016skqb216.txt,"HELD: The application for interim spousal support was granted and the respondent ordered to pay $500 per month. The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The parties were in a spousa relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband has children from a prior relationship for whom he pays support. During the relationship the wife suffered from health problems which resulted in her becoming disabled and unable to continue her employment. During this time the husband secured full-time employment with CN. The wife has resided with extended family members (most recently her mother), with the result that she has no costs for housing. In so doing the wife suggests that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply. These factors do not constitute an exhaustive list with the most important consideration being whether the net assets for distribution far exceed the amount requested. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousals rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appellant seeks to have respondent's income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of the capital cost allowances. There is clearly no basis for adding the weight of the grain onhand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action by the respondent and this grain is therefore to be viewed as a part of the gross income of his respondent in the year in which it is sold. The appeal is dismissed with costs on triple Column V to the respondent who appealed the rejection of the figure by the chambers judge in this instance.

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,"FIAT: The applicant applied for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The respondent vigorously opposed severance on the grounds that the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the governments of Canada and Les Oblats de Marie Immaculee du Manitoba. HELD: The order of severance sought by the applicant was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial.  The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues are severed are groundless. The plaintiff was stalled in the pursuit of resolution of the issues. He had been subjected to a paper war conducted by the parties to the cross and third parties proceedings (see Noble J's judgment dated November 23, 2000). It was in the best interests of justice that the order of leave for the claimant should be granted so the issue could proceed at an early date. The action was directed to proceed separate from and before the trial of the new issues raised in both the issues of cross- and the third party claim in this action."

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; conviction entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm. Although there was considerable evidence from both the appellant himself and from an expert witness that the appellant was very drunk and acting very much out of character, there was no evidence of such extreme intoxication as to negate an aware state of mind as in the case of insanity or automatism."
e_1992canlii2523.txt,"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence. Dismissing the appeals, that the trial judge made no errors in his considerations. The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although the appellant pled guilty to each of the two offences, the appellant was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robbery and 1 year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively, and an order prohibiting him from possessing firearms for ten years from the date of his release, as is provided by s.100(1) of the Code, and having regard to the principles advanced in making the sentencing recommendations, the Court dismissed the appeal."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge was entitled to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. 2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence has been met. 3) There was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The matter was remitted to Queen's Bench for determination."

(formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","Plaintiff's bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in March 1996. The trustee never applied for discharge. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)The respondent was discharged because the trustee was transmitting an 82% interest in the real property to the trustee's name. 2)Although the respondent's report indicated that non-exempt equity existed at the time of her bankruptcy, she alleged that the transmission was an arbitrary action taken without her agreement and knowledge. She also complained of the transmission being made without her having had an opportunity to oppose it because there was no hearing associated with her discharge. Her present application for discharge should be vacated if it were not for the trustee accepting the applicant's discharge and reversing her decision to make an absolute order for discharge without any hearing or order for removal of exemptions."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents in their power, possession or control. HELD: 1) The purpose of the examination for discovery is to determine whether the third party contractor, pursuant to the governing legislation, is liable to pay PST on the sale of tangible personal property pursuant to s. 6(1) of the Education and Health Tax Act (the 'Act') and to identify documents that they would like to be disclosed. 2) The third party contractors are to provide the plaintiff with responses to certain undertakings within 30 days. The plaintiff refers to Canada Revenue Agency Interpretation Bulletin IT-145R dated January 6, 2004 (Canadian Manufacturing and Processing Profits Reduced Rate of Corporate Tax) which states that the reduced rate of corporate income tax applies only to income from manufacturing or processing activities of goods for sale and not to income arising out of the supply of goods through contracts for work and materials. 3) Undertaking #11 and the defendant’s response stated that if it was liable to refund the PST to the plaintiff that was collected and levied in error by the third parties, then the defendant was entitled to payment of PST from the thirdparty on the cement consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. 4) The parties agreed that the plaintiff would provide a detailed list of documents to identify which documents were appropriate for the purpose of seeking further disclosure.  5) The plaintiff was not required to provide any specific language for identifying documents. The parties indicated that they will continue to bill these contracts as separate sales of materials and separate sale of labour services for the installation of the materials on real property. The third parties deny all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendants as a third party claimant and specifically deny that the the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against the defendant. 6) The specific orders applied to each party will be addressed one at time."
b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. The common characteristics of a trust or a relationship between a doctor and the hospital are not defined by law. Neither is the relationship between hospital and its doctors defined by MoHS or the Standards of Physicians and Surgeons. Nor was it a relationship that gave rise to either a trust nor a fiducary relationship. Neither hospital nor the plaintiff had any obligations to report to the board or to administer the hospital's emergency services. Neither doctor has any fiduciARY duty towards the hospital nor has he breached any of the standards or the bylaws governing the hospital."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time was an inmate. The accused's attention was not focused on the legal requirements of the Code but on the needs of his patient. The doctor testified that he had had the doctor complete the wrong form for the wrong reason and the accused had not been able to recall signing the second certificate. HELD: The Court held that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. The Court found that the officer did ask the permission of the doctor to take the blood and that the doctor advised him that it was okay to do so and that he did not recall signing it. The Certificate was not signed by the doctor. The officer was not able to communicate the request of permission from the doctor in more explicit language and the evidence of the hospital staff was not helpful in establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the blood was taken from the accused. On the whole the Court was left with reasonable doubt as to who actually took the blood, how it was taken, if the opinion that the taking of the blood for law enforcement purposes would not endanger the accused, and whether the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence that its evidence could have been proved by the certificate, P-5, if it had been relied upon."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, who advised him that the officer had given him only one choice, that of Legal Aid. The accused sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The Court held the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body was not raised as part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand. The Certificate ofalyses was admitted into evidence. The Court found the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed and the accused was not given an opportunity to exercise his right to counsel. The certificate of analysis was excluded as there was a delay of 11 minutes. The court found that the delay was of relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel and the Court found that although the accused expressed a clear desire to speak with counsel of his choice, the officer's grounds for demanding the samples were irrelevant. The defence argued the accused should have been informed of how long he had waited in the police vehicle as he did not have a watch and the breath sample was not produced. The issue of impaired driving and the potentially serious consequences of the breach on the accused’s Charter rights had not been addressed and society was not seeking to exclude the certificate ofalyses."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while suspended, contending the adjudicator's findings of credibility were so limited by the evidence of three other witnesses and were insufficient to prove the appellant was in fact the driver. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the full evidence; there was insufficient evidence to prove that the appellant's son was in the vehicle; and there were other grounds as well as those found to be beyond reasonable doubt. The court reviewed the jurisprudence on the standard of review in summary conviction appeals and found that, absent an error of law or a miscarriage of justice, the test to be applied is not whether the findings of the trial judge are unreasonable or cannot besupported by theevidence. It is rather open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on these findings."

The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs. The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned. The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs which were in the possession of the proposed appellant but claimed by the proposed appellant. She then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied that the wording of Rule 407(2) of the Queen'sBench Rules raised a significant issue of importance.

In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed.

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his part. The Court also found that the accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which takes him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of aggravated assault on a police officer on count 1 because he came out of his home to tell the driver to 'grab brain'. The accused did not stop his assault immediately and it was necessary for the police tracking dog to physically remove him from the officer. On count 3 the accused was given credit for five blows to the face while the officer was on the ground, suffering a broken nose and ankle."
d_2004nssc196.txt,"The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease. After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","The plaintiff, through her numbered company, assumed the operation of a motel by lease with an option to purchase. The lessor, Metro Computerized Bookkeeping, made several changes in the interests of the plaintiff, resulting in the plaintiff's termination of her employment with the defendant. The defendant counterclaimed for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. At issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to return the $20,000 security deposit from the defendant and whether she should seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The plaintiff's application was dismissed. 1)The delay in this case was full nine years after the cause of action arose. 2)The defendants thought that all outstanding issues with Cluett had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations. 3)The elapse of 9 years raises a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been. The action was not commenced until October 2001, a full nine year later. There was no evidence that the plaintiff sought or received legal advice during this time. It seems that this circumstance relates to a disability other than that alluded to in MacDonald's letter of 30 October 1992. This also seems to relate more to a personal injury situation. 4)The plaintiff's lawyer advised her to call Eric Corkum, who had advised her not to pursue any action against Metro if the deposit was not returned."

A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff was subjected to what was described as 'elder abuse' and was being financially taken advantage off by third parties. A review panel provided for in the Mentally Disordered Persons Act recommended that the plaintiff be examined by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist who conducted the examination was not qualified to perform the examination and there was no record of the review panel hearing or reasons given for its decision to uphold the certificate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Act does contemplate the trial of an issue on person's competency to bring a civil law suit. The defendants are of the view that on the basis of the evidence that led to the original certificate of mental incompetency being issued, and the evidence led at a review panel, they have more than reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff lacks the mental competence to instruct counsel in this matter. 2)There is no need for the court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction if the remedy sought is readily available to the applicant. The risk of bypassing or duplicating existing legal procedures or the rules is avoided. The court is not obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced his class action in June 2006 against the defendants and third parties. The defendants appealed that decision and applied to the Court to stay the action on an interim basis. The applicants sought the same discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, or Rule 173 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court. They argued that this action and similar proceedings claiming similar relief for similar claims had been commenced in other jurisdictions, but this court was now required to consider in more than one jurisdiction. HELD: The Court held that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were intended to be considered by the Court during the certification application of the proposed class action. The Court found that the application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and time. It would be appropriate to consider the application in an interim or permanent basis in light of the new legislation. The applicant was awarded one set of costs only to be shared equally."

The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","The Trustee sought an order prohibiting law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be a creditor of that bankrupt. The Bank wanted to have its counsel nominated as solicitors for it. The solicitor for the Bank opposed the application. For the Trust, that there were significant areas of conflict with the interests of the Bank and that the trustee should not be in a position where it could appear to be influenced by the bank in making that decision. For Bank, that a conflict of interest would create a great financial burden because of the time required by new counsel to acquaint themselves with information already in the knowledge of present counsel. The trustee sought to have the law firms withdraw from acting for theTrustee. Counsel for Bank declined to do so. In issue was whether or not it should be permitted to continue to act for the bankrupt. For NsC Corp., the trustee owed a fiduciary duty to all its creditors. The respondent bank's solicitor had acted for the trustee throughout the proceedings and was not opposed to the applicant's application for removal.

At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.

There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination.

The adjudicator of the small claims court declined to hear the application, saying that he was hearing an appeal of an order made by the Director of Residential Tenancies. The landlord brought an interlocutory motion to have the adjudicator hear his application for review of a rental increase. The Small Claims court adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small claims Court had jurisdiction to hear his appeal. The applicant brought three procedural issues: 1) he had not filed new evidence; 2) the respondent had not given leave to the appellant to file new evidence and as such the affidavit could not be considered.  With regard to the respondent's concerns, the small Claims Court Act appeal provisions do not provide for the submission of any new evidence. If there was an order or determination from an adjudicator on an issue involving residential tenancies, it is a re-hearing of the facts. It is not the same as an appeal to our court which relies on the record from the court below."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, female and child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to s 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The child is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant s.485(1)(b) of the code. The maiden name of the 19 year old woman, as set out on the baby's Registration of Live Birth, is different than the surname of the natural mother. There is nothing from the person who says she is the mother (herein 'the natural mother' of the child) positively stating that no other person could be the father of the fetus. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised of the necessity of providing some basic evidence which can satisfy the court that the technician or expert who will carry out DNA procedures is properly qualified to do so. The proper inference to be drawn from the words of Gerein J. (b) is that a DNA sample obtained from a natural mother is a bodily substance 'found or obtained' within the body of a person involved with the commission of an offence. The natural mother cannot, in any reasonable definition of the word, be properly considered to be the victim of the alleged incest. Based on the Information, which is imprecise in this regard, the alleged offence was committed in Saskatchewan or Manitoba. The DNA evidence obtained is not relevant to the investigation of this matter. In any event, the court will ordinarily be unable to conclude that the child is victim. The probative benefits of DNA analysis are concerned, the crucial determination will be whether the father and mother have the requisite number of matching DNA characteristics; the DNA of the baby will then provide further confirmation or negation of the sexual relationship.  1) There is no evidence that the father or mother has a certificate or any similar qualification. 2) There was nothing to indicate that the biological mother could be considered the mother. 3) The information contained in the Informations In Support was confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding.

e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant was a First Nations faculty member who was involved in the creation and operation of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. He had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina but believed he was being invited to present the results of research he had done for an Assembly of First Nations national political organization. After reviewing all of the facts, the decision was found to be reasonable. The reasons as a whole support the decision."

The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place.

e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by the Bank of Canada. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The Bank's motion heard and decided by filing an Agreed Statement of Facts with attached exhibits. The Bank has cooperated with the Court's decision regarding priority to the leased equipment. The issues are whether the lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the PPSA and whether it is entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s. 3. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a more than 1 year' in the Meaning of the PCSA and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Bank's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the bank."

The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago, the mother unilaterally moved with the children to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. She has formed a new relationship and she is pregnant. While the father has been in jail for a number of criminal matters, he was sentenced in October and is currently in custody. HELD: 1) The mother's move with the child should be allowed on an interim basis. 2) There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. While this is not a tenable situation, the fact that the children cannot remain 'on hold' while he is in jail may well be a factor in their remaining primary parent.  3) The court adopted the Gordon v. Goertz principles. It appears beyond dispute that the mother has always been the primary caregiver to these children. There is no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour. This matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. The court's willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may be a significant factor in her remaining the primary parent at this time."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","Pottie, a licensed realtor, appealed a finding of unprofessional conduct and sanctions imposed by the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. Pottie had arranged for the purchase of a condo by a woman who had paid $500, $1,000, and $1k,000 of which was for personal living expenses. She had then asked her brother-in-law, who resided in Nova Scotia, to make inquiries for her. The parties agreed to a revised formal settlement agreement whereby the full $8,500 paid by the woman was remitted to the appellant, but the appellant had to complete the new Salesperson Licensing course prior to applying for the license. The Commission subpoenaed the appellant's personal bank records and found that he had deposited all the rent cheques and the security deposit in his personal account and used them for personal expenses. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed. The court found that the Commission's decision was quickly made and did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented. The complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension and the absence of any explanation for the false lease resolved primarily by their finding on the credibility of the witnesses and the length of time it took them to reach the decision. The commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty. The penalty of the board was excessive having regard to this case."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) this license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) no advertising of the availability of liquor service was permitted. The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another.

3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any agreement for Sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v).

4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate claims against the plaintiffs based on allegations that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs with respect to certain specified incidents. The first claim was for defamation. The second claim was against the defendant for inducing a breach of a contract. HELD: The Court granted the application for summary judgment of claim. The Court held that the pleadings alone did not constitute sufficient evidence to strike out the provisions of the statement of claim as they were not filed with the Court. The pleadings were also dismissed as being without merit. As the statements of claim do not serve as evidence of the defendants’ intent to defame the plaintiffs and are not material to the plaintiff’s defence, the Court ordered them to strike them out."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order for child maintenance retroactive to the date of their separation. The father had made overtures to the mother for increased child support but had resisted such requests. The mother applied for a retroactive award pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. In January 2009, a Consent Order was issued which dealt with most of the issues but also provided retroactivity of child maintenance for the period 2001 to December 2007. The order required that the father have a responsibility to provide child maintenance to his wife as he was in arrears with regard to child support payments. The wife had made no effort to obtain information about the father's income prior to the separation as she was not made aware of what his obligations were and, in fact, had been told by the father that he did not have the financial ability to provide additional child maintenance. The child had benefited from an adequate standard of living since the separation and was doing well in the care of his mother. The husband had made efforts to obtain relevant information from the Department of Social Services, but had been unable to do so because his income had not increased. He now sought retroactive awards for child support in accordance with the Guidelines. The Court found that the wife had 'effective notice' that her application for retroactive child support had been made and that she had not been encouraged to increase her monthly payment by any means necessary. Therefore, the mother had ineffective notice that her current payment was deficient. Retroactive awards awarded retroactively to the year 2001 when the father was paying $300 per month for child care expenses and then $350 per month thereafter until December 2007 when the order was retroactive. The current award is retroactive for the year 2007."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that the exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at the initial voir dire as there had not been any evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. The issue of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter right occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017 and the issue of exclusion ofevidence pursuant s.24(2)(was not determined until February 6, 2017). The trial resumed with the assistance of the Crown. The accused sought to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. In the alternative, he could exclude those images not automatically cached by web browser during an internet search. The Court rejected this application because, while it is possible to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer, the Court found that the search would bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. After painting the plaintiff's shop, he experienced difficulties with the gun nozzle. He bounced it on the floor and turned the switch on and off several times while activating the gun. The gun nozzle plugged and the paint dribbled out instead of spraying. The plaintiff was unable to function at his job for about 3 months after the amputation, although he went to work. He needed an extra man. The plaintiffs contention that the defendant was duty bound to provide warning to renters, but did not, because there was no causal connection between the negligent handling of the gun and the non-pecuniary damage issue. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities of life was assessed at $10,000. It was not necessary to resolve the issue whether the arrangement between the defendant and the plaintiff was partnership or independent contractor. Pursuant to principles enunciated in Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] S.C.R. 66 (C.A.], Burfitt v. A&amp; Eisert, [1986] W.W.R.; St. John's, [1988] Kille, and [1938] Kampff, [1984] WLamp; Gaudet, [1991] WW. R. 66] are not sufficient to establish causality between a rental and a consumer. A non-cognisable damage issue exists where there is a possibility of exacerbation of the problem and the defendant has failed to take steps to mitigate the loss. The waiver is ineffective."

An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","The father appealed the June 4, 1984 custody decision to his father, Harvey Fick. The trial judge accepted the testimony of the father's expert witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's Expert Witness who testified about the effect of abuse on children. He also found the mother's interpretation of events not to be credible. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no order for costs. DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 25th day of June A.D. 1993. VANCISE J.A. LANE: The Court of Appeal delayed the judgment because of our concern that the child should be allowed to complete his year in school without having to transfer to a different school in another city. The Court also delayed its judgment to enable it to enforce liberal access between the day the appeal was heard and today's date as the father had not previously had regular access to the child."
6_2011skqb386.txt,"The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. HELD: The Court dismissed the tenant's appeal. The Court found that the hearing Officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the claims and evidence of the tenants. The tenant failed to properly identify which area of the unit was unusable, failed to describe the relief sought or the nature of argument they intended to advance. Moreover, as the owner was unable to attend on the scheduled hearing date, the matter proceeded unfairly without an opportunity for him to be heard."
9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the former spouse and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge. The trial judge found that the respondent, the secured party, had to authorize the buyer to deal with the security and that the buyer must know of the authorization. HELD: The appeal is reduced to whether the agreement or conduct of the respondent constitutes a priority and whether the sale is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject only to the condition that payment is received in full and the applicant has no interest in releasing the security interest until he has received payment.  1) Section 28 (1) contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to dealwith the secured debtor. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal With the collateral. 2) There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured partner. The Credit Union appeals this decision.  3) The appellant shall have costs in the usual way on double Column V.  4) The issue is reduced by whether the respondent authorized the sale of the mobile home or if he authorized the resale. It is not necessary for the appellant to find on the facts of this case that there was an implied authorization to deal in the collateral as result of prior commercial dealings of the parties."

Offers from potential purchasers for the barn facility and the non-typical design of the dwelling may be impacting negatively on value. HELD: Application adjourned. 1)The Court was not comfortable setting an upset price for the sale at $60,000 considering the amount the respondents have invested in the property and the amount they have to offer. 2)The evidence submitted by the respondents to date did not do this. 3)The respondents were not prepared to take the onus on the return date of providing evidence why the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order for sale."

HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

However, immediately prior to this matter being heard in chambers, he made the payment. The children continued to live with the mother and she remarried and babysited. The applicant claimed child support and claimed s.7 expenses. This claim was based on orthodontic costs for Kurtis. 2)The guidelines require the court to use the most recent information. 3)The financial evidence filed by the respondent with respect to 1997 was not sufficient to determine income. In that regard, the respondent was going to impute 15% of the capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the respondent pursuant to s.19 in each of the above years. Findings that the applicant has appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she has only deducted a portion of her home and vehicle expenses; that portion is attributable to her business. 4)The court declined to include the 1997 income information in this calculation, despite the fact that the guidelines require it to be used."

No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing on the premises of their employer and prohibiting them, their employees and their contractors from entering the premises. The defendants refused to supply and/or return of the notice of motion and several picketers jumped on to vehicles attempting to enter the premises and caused damage to one of their vehicles. Several vehicles were held up for periods of time and the plaintiff's undertaking as to damages was made to the plaintiff. HELD: The court granted the order and the interim injunction. It held that the acts complained of were illegal and should be declared illegal. It also ordered an end to the unlawful picketing which had already caused loss and damage to property."

The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, a stolen motor vehicle, crack cocaine. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. During the voir dire, police officers conducted a strip search on the accused. The accused admitted to the fact that he had the vehicle stolen, but argued that the strip search was specifically related to the reasons for the arrest and was not intended to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. Accused found not guilty of all charges; the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and by the necessity to prevent its disposal. The evidence heard was that the complainant had removed the plastic bag from his underwear, that the officer had touched the accused, and that the male complainant had rearranged his clothing to reveal a small amount of his private area. Although the accused did not know how the drugs were removed, he said the officer told him to 'dug around his privy area' and that he'smelled like a plastic bag.' The accused's explanation that the police had placed a call to set up a drug deal was not supported by the officer's evidence; there was no physical contact by the accused and the evidence was determined to be irrelevant by the court. In the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty. The Court considered contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. As the Court heard contradictory evidence regarding the central issues of consent and credibility, it was open to him to claim the complainant did not consent to having sex with him. To be legally effective, consent must be voluntary. Therefore, even if the complainant consented, or her conduct raises areasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consenting, need not consider whether the accused had an honest and mistaken belief that consent."

The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in the U.S.A. The aircraft crashed in August 1992, and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in the manufacture or construction of the package.

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse brought an action against the defendants for negligent driving. She alleged that the defendants encouraged the plaintiff to take sedative after she had an abortion. The nurse testified that she had been advised against driving after the procedure because of the plaintiff's prior use of sedative. The plaintiff also testified that during her recovery from the accident, she had experienced a delayed vasovagal reaction which resulted in her having to take an anesthetic to relieve herself of any pain and fatigue. She also testified about the difficulty of driving after a therapeutic abortion. At the time of the abortion, the plaintiff was permitted to drive home from the clinic. She claimed that this was because she was afraid that the plaintiff would forget her seat belt. Awarding the plaintiff $115,000 for the delayed vasivagal response, that the defendant was negligent in failing to inform the plaintiff that she was driving. The court referred to the fact that most patients with this type of medical condition have had to undergo some type of surgery to have their sex reassignment removed or their pregnancies aborted. As a result, many of the plaintiffs had abortions while they were awaiting the procedure. The Court referred to this case as a case of mistaken identity. The defendant and her husband were both practicing orthopaedic surgeons and testified at trial. They had been practicing medicine for more than 30 years and had been subject to numerous adverse effects, including some of the same symptoms as the plaintiff when she was performing the abortion on the plaintiff. The female plaintiff suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She said that she suffered from memory loss, fatigue and depression for several years. She attributed this to the defendant's sedative use, but also attributed it to her own experiences with driving while on the drug. Dismissing the evidence, that there was no recognized risk to driving after an abortion, given the nature and persistence of the Ativan effects, that a patient would not be prevented from driving for longer periods of time following a sedative application, and that this should not be an issue for the plaintiff in this instance. The plaintiffs' evidence on liability was admitted as follows: 1)The plaintiff was granted an order by consent without leaving the courtroom. She was to appear at trial on a charge of negligence causing bodily harm. 2)The defendant was held liable for the costs of the litigation. 3)The court referred at length to the plaintiff and awarded the sum of $11500 to the female plaintiff. 4)The Court referred at"
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorksdale. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Lions Club with the assistance of the fire department. The fire department was standing by in the sense that it had a fire truck parked nearby and had some of its members in attendance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. The respondents shall have their costs taxed in the usual way. The Court found that the trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same as in the respondents' case. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or caused by the respondents."

He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","HELD: The application was granted. The court held that it would disregard portions of the applicant’s affidavit as it was not intended to be a declaration. It ordered that the application be allowed and the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation be interpreted to determine the voting rights of the commercial owners. As there were only seven positions on the Board, the board was composed of seven members. The applicant was asking the court to interpret the bylaw so that the commercial owner would not be allowed to cast their vote on the remaining four seats on the board. Preliminary objections were made pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen”s Bench Rules and the preliminary decision clarifying what the Court would disregard.

The Court found that there was no unusual danger on the premises of the defendant and awarded the plaintiff damages for pain and suffering in the amount of $6,000. Based on the evidence of the insurance adjuster, who investigated the plaintiff claim when first advanced, the Court awarded damages for suffering and pain as a result of the Plaintiff's negligence.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). The accused had served time in custody for the same offence. He had sold cocaine to undercover officers for $4,250.00. The accused was only 21 years old. He was bound by a youth probation order that was to stay out of the Province for two years. He sold cocaine in areas frequented by youth. The Crown conceded that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Ontario Court of Appeal provided some guiding principles on the use of s. 40(1) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act, including the importance of rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The Court found that with the accused not facing any charges for the trafficking offence and that the evidence showed that the youth was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in La Ronge, Saskatchewan, selling cocaine, the aggravating factors were the accused's possession of 76 grams of cocaine (76 grams) and the fact that he was only 1 month into a probation order after having been convicted for possession of the purpose of trafficking in cocaine (one of the terms of that probation order) and that he had not been ordered to stay in the Province unless he had permission of the Court to do so, and that his previous sentence of probation as imposed by the Court had failed to promote his rehabilitation or his re-integration. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. The evidence showed he had been cruising around in the Friendship Centre for the past 1 month and that there was little to no evidence that the motivation behind the drug trafficking operation was anything but for financial gain. As the accused had been living in the area for close to 3 years and had not had any contact with the community, this was not an aggravating factor."

The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law.

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenant to pay rent and the alleged breaches of the covenants in the lease. The issues with respect to the hail damage and the claims for repair were far in excess of those provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease.[1] A tenant is entitled to set off against rent due to a landlord by the landlord.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury. HELD: 1)There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed and it was essential that he know now what his future obligations were. 2)The applicant had not received any employment income during the marriage nor had he been economically secure. The wife had been economically disadvantaged to a greater degree than the applicant. She was able to pursue and develop his career as an engineer but had little employment security. 3)The parties had three children. The respondent had recently commenced university courses and was unable to find employment. She sought the advice of a certified financial planner respecting the implications of converting his RRSPs into RRIF's and locking-ins retirement income funds (LIRA's) and any other retirement vehicles. She suggested that she could sell her residence in order to increase her monthly income.  The applicant was ordered to pay $1,250 per month up to March 1, 2001. From that date, the support payable by the applicant to the respondent would be reduced to $500.  4)The respondent had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation and to have it reviewed by it, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. 5)The application of these legal principles to the facts and circumstances did not warrant termination nor a reduction of the quantum of the support.  6)Given the changes to the needs and means of the parties since the divorce, the applicant's position was now worse while the respondent's was better. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of spousals support set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act. 7)The agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that spousary support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the Parties. Surely at the time the agreement was made, the parties had contemplated their eventual retirement and the financial consequences that it would have for each of them.

c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.

The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested a fee of 50 percent of the first counsel fee. HELD: 1)The expert medical evidence introduced by the defendant was of marginal value to the plaintiff. The court found that more was obtained than set out in the offer to settle; extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to file medical reports and the costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. 2)The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file a medical practitioners' report without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. Questions as to what effect pain disorder had on the plaintiff and when that pain disorder first occurred were major matters. 3)Costs payable by party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure that their testimony will assist the court.

The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The RCMP had previously applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants. The search of the accused's residence, the seizure of the money (and other items) and Smith's arrest were the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada including evidence allegedly implicating the accused, Smith. The investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The Crown argued that if both warrants were found to be invalid, then the resultant warrantless search of Smith's residence and surrounding premises was warrantless. The Court found that both the Code & CDSA warrants had obvious and noticeable omissions and/or errors. Nor did they read properly from the standpoint of simple English. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was the only occupant of the premises. During the search, the RCMP observed movement inside the residence and noticed that it was empty of any evidence. HELD: The Court held that the search warrants were valid and that they authorized the search. Although the accused had not disclosed the alleged offence to the RCMP, the fact that he had obtained the warrants and that the RCMP had not endorsed him on any ground that would violate his Charter rights would not prejudice the accused. The evidence satisfied the Court that the accused was not entitled to exclude the evidence at trial as a result of the voir dire and that there was no breach of any Charter right or Freedoms arising out of the application.

5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused plead guilty to a sexual assault of his son. The Crown alleged the offences occurred at his home when his wife was at work. The accused was charged with the offence of sexual assault. The evidence related to the accused's ability to communicate in English and purported admission of the offence and an expression of remorse. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the test in Nevin, supra, was not met and there was no evidence that the accused had not understood the nature of the allegation against him and that his remorse was for the trouble brought to his family. The Court found that his evidence regarding his awareness of the consequences of his guilty plea to the sexual assault was not credible."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.",HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The court found that a youth court judge should have assumed jurisdiction in proceedings which were commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Crown failed to show that the accused had committed any of the offences committed when he was a young man. The evidence did not support a conviction on the charges. The youth court was not prepared to assume jurisdiction on counts two and three.

The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born August 28, 2005. The petitioner went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to the petitioner's increased costs as a result of the shared parenting arrangement. However, there is some evidence that the petitioner has not worked well with the support system as it was not set out in the original parenting judgment. 2) The petitioner has failed to meet the onus upon him to establish that a material changed of circumstance has occurred. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that was followed. The parenting judgment provided that when an equal parenting arrangement occurred, the petitioner would continue to provide basic Guidelines maintenance as he currently does, with no deduction based on increased parenting time."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The marriage was established as a result of the divorce. The custody of the two children was ordered to be reciprocal on alternate weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening with the objective that the children be together with the same parent on most weekends. The parties had agreed on a pension with a Canada Trust Powerline loan and the mother was to convey one-half of the commuted value of the petitioner's share of the children to a locked-in RRSP. The other issue was whether division should be made as at the date of the petition with an allowance for interest thereafter. HELD: 1)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the respondent. The pension was to be divided subject to matrimonial property adjustment calculations and the amount of spousal maintenance to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 2)The respondent would have to contribute his proportionate share of orthodontic treatment expenses for the petitioner that is not covered by insurance. 3)Spousal support would be reviewed in the meantime on the ordinary ground of material change in circumstances. There was no significant health issue.  4)The parties were ordered to keep the children on their group insurance plan so long as they are eligible and to designate them as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as defined in the Divorce Act. 5)Each party was ordered, after realtor's commission and solicitor's fees and disbursements, to be equally divided. 6)The court stipulated that spousals be reviewed by the parties at any time after December 31, 2003."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The parties agreed to joint custody of the children and that the father would pay child support of $647 per month for the child care expenses. The court reviewed the circumstances of the parties' relationship and found that they had been maintaining a consistent parenting pattern and that this was not detrimental to the children's academic or social life. The father sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the wife would equally share their time with the children. He suggested that this occur on a weekly basis with the move occurring on Sunday evening. The mother sought spousal support and the father agreed to pay $647.00 per month. HELD: The court ordered that the current parenting arrangements remain in effect with the exception of the change regarding Remembrance Day. The Court found that the parents had been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest. The more specific the decision was, the more restrictions are placed in the way of the parents continuing their successful performing of this function."
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for a shared parental arrangement. The children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. In 2009, business pressures forced the respondent to move away from the sharing parenting arrangement to an arrangement whereby he sees his children less frequently. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a Shared Parenting arrangement.  Corollary Relief Order granted in respect of the petitioner's application to vary the corollaries relief judgment based on the evidence of the parties' children.  1) Registration of the Separation Agreement was held. The parties' separation agreement was registered in 2009. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. The Respondent filed a second opinion, this time questioning the relevance of the previous order. He argued that the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24 (CanLII) required that the parties continue to pay the agreed-upon amount of $2,000 per month to the petitioner even though the parties no longer agreed to a shared Parenting Agreement. He questioned the appropriateness of imposing the spOUSAL support obligation on the petitioner given that it would affect the financial stability of their home and the stability of the child's educational program if it was discontinued. Application for leave to appeal was filed September 15, 2009.  2) The petitioner had filed a separate action requesting an order for corollars of divorce pursuant to the Divorce Act s.15.2 (see: s.16). The respondent had filed an affidavit in 2009 that referenced Miglin. He also filed an answer to the petition in 2009 and filed another affidavit in 2010. He requested that the court consider whether the separation had the same status as the Corollaries Relief Order and whether a separate order for maintenance or respecting access and visiting privileges made under the Act was warranted. He was also cross-examined about his business expenses. He submitted that there were arrears on the mortgage and he was at"
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.",HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no Charter breach. The reason for the delay was that there was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. The accused had not suffered actual prejudice. The conditions of release he was subject to were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. There were no errors made by the accused in the questioning. The delay was not attributable to the accused or caused by any of the other accused.
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1994. There were two children of the marriage, Chad and Ryan. Chad was in high school and was dependant.

The wife had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. The husband's car was repossessed and he repurchased it from the Bank of Montreal on terms set by the Bank.

c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the petitioner’s decision was imminent. The court ordered a shared parenting regime and ordered that the child’S primary residence be in Moose Jaw or Regina. The respondent’d parents were divorced in November 2012.

The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon. 2) The trial judge was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not testify as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword and where it could be purchased. He must have had special qualifications that would justify his opinion. 3) There was no evidence that the accused, who had just purchased the sword, intended to use it as a weapon. The only evidence he had was that it likely came from a novelty store. The accused testified that he was unsure why he bought the sword. He testified at the trial that he had just bought it for $10. He said he thought it was a decorative item. He also stated that in his opinion the sword was a novelty sword. No attempt was made by the Crown to call evidence to contradict his testimony. 4) The judge properly placed the accused's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The golf course was owned and operated by the defendant. In 1997, the defendant, which was then owner of the course, entered into an agreement with the defendant to open up the land beside the course for residential development. The defendants, which were also subject to the action, agreed to joint liability for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property for the past nine years. The plaintiff plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had been here for nine years and for damages they should be compensated for. The defendant refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. HELD: The Court ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs $18,000 to remedy the present situation and for the damage they would suffer if the golf balls left their yard did not enter their property. The indemnity clause in the development agreement between the defendant and Emerald Park was suspended for a period to allow the defendants an opportunity to see whether the new tee box would remedy the situation.  1) The Court was not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy this dangerous and annoying problem. 2) Since the plaintiffs refused to discuss the wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause and even if it did bind the plaintiffs, it did not release the defendants from the claim by Bosenberg and Strassburg who continue to have the same problem.  2) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $6,000. 3) The defendants were ordered to pay $8,000 in damages. 4) The plaintiff was awarded costs of the action. 5) The defendant was ordered to take the position that the plaintiff could not succeed because of the wording in the option agreement between Great Plains and Emerald. They could not have agreed to the terms of the agreement because they would have had to accept the expert's report.  6) The amount of damages awarded at trial was reduced to $1,500. 7) The court was unable to find costs for the plaintiffs."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. In September 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the more significant grounds and instead applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to Appeal on one or more of the grounds raised in the proceedings. HELD: The application for release was dismissed. The Court of appeal declined to grant leave to continue the application for the duration of the appellant's detention. The prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The court was not satisfied that the prospective appealas a whole is not frivolous. The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the public good, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect for the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."

The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the appellant’s freedom of expression by prohibiting overly large billboard type signs and by reducing the proliferation of signs with the requirement that the signs relate to the property on which they are located. The sign was a third party sign which was not permitted in the downtown core area. The Town contended that the By-laws were rationally connected to the objective and that the means used by the municipality to achieve its goal were reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellants right of freedom of speech. The application was allowed and an order was issued directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents."

The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well. The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures. HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump. 2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE. 3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest. 4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands. 5)The totality of the evidence did not support the portrayal by the defendant of the plaintiff as a high handed, arrogant operator who simply forgot it had a minority partner.  6)The plaintiff was entitled to its taxable costs.","The plaintiff invoiced the defendant for its share of the $681,955.58 costs associated with the Horizontal Well but the defendant refused to pay the whole amount. The plaintiff sought an order requiring the defendant to pay $49,701.61 representing 35% of the regular lifting and production costs of all joint interest wells under the Operating Agreement and a declaration that it holds a builders' lien against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due. HELD: The defendant was to pay all costs associated the Horizont Well, 35% for the screw pump costs incurred after the Default Notice and 35% associated screw pump and maintenance costs incurred post-default. The default was set at $140,000. The defendant's claim that the joint interest suffered from excessive water flow was dismissed. Costs in excess of $1 million were added to the original AFE.  The defendant argued that its maximum liability for drilling and completion costs is 35%of 110% of Original AFE amount or $156,637.25. On the issue of costs, the defendant relied primarily on Clause 301 of the CAPL 1981. Clause 301 provides that the operator is delegated the control and management of the exploration, completion and maintenance of the wells and the operation of the equipment. The Court agreed that the defendant was liable for 35% and 35 % of screw pump/filling costs after the default notice. As the plaintiff was not prepared to accept surrender and quit claim in full satisfaction of the amount owing but gave notice that in default of payment in full or the granting of quit claim, it would proceed with steps to recover the indebtedness."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. The Public trustee was not served with notices of application for property guardianship and did not intervene in such applications. If the applicant was from out of the Province or was not a beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, or if there was opposition within the family to the appointment, bonds were usually required. However, in the writer's experience this was not the case. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When the defendant turned across the path of the other vehicle, and the two vehicles came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do by s.50(3). The court found as a fact that when the defendant commenced his turn, any vehicle lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: 1) A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. 2) Procedural fairness is an appropriate standard to apply in cases of this nature. 3) The applicants submit the Board failed to meet the common law duty of fairness in passing its resolution for a school closure. There was no prejudice caused by non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election. The Board did not keep minutes of in-camera meetings. There is no suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided. The board ignored, or did not directly respond to all of the submissions made by the opposition. The Court notes that there are a number of considerations that may influence the court. A preliminary examination of the law doesnot suggest a prima fade case."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation owned by the husband's wife should be disclosed as they were not kept in the respondent's home and did not have the filing information required for their examination. Whether that submission had any merit was left to the chambers' hearing judge to determine.  1) To determine the entitlement of the petitioner to child support and to obtain the full picture of her income from the ranching operation was therefore beyond the Court's reach. Neither counsel for the respondent nor the petitioner could find anything to support their assertions that the mother's income was totally irrelevant to the father's farming operation. 2) The respondent's claim that the petitioner had canvassed the company's financial records in the absence of any income to assist in determining her entitlement was not supported by the petitioner's evidence. To canvass the corporate's financial history would be totally unjustified because it would allow the petitioner and her father to continue to reside in the same residence and would require the Court to find out anything more about the operation with the respondent."

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person.

After the Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry and he advised that he wished to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the Defence was guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The Sergeant was not a material witness in this preliminary inquiry. The Defence was not negligent in not having made arrangements to have Sergeant Barbar available for the preliminary hearing.

e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that the officer satisfied himself of the identity of the accused by reference to a photograph maintained by a government agency. The accused took no issue with the voluntariness of the statement made by the driver as to his name and date of birth, nor was any Charter violation asserted. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The Court followed the reasoning in Nicholson (1984), 12 C.C.C.(3d) 228 (Alta. C.A.). The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice was the same person who had stood trial. 2) The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible. The Court was referred to the authorities who examined driver records, obtained a photograph of an individual named the accused and concluded that this was the person with whom he was dealing. 3) Although there was no identification in court, the Court found that the accused was properly identified and properly obtained his Name and Date of Birth. There was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown and service on a lawyer could not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. 4) The accused's s. 7 Charter rights were not infringed. The Crown did not establish that he was disqualified or prohibited from driving."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.",The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants claimed liability insurance and claimed that they had been paid for the operation by the plaintiff corporations. The plaintiff corporations refused to answer questions as to when airfare tickets were reserved and purchased. The defendant corporate officer examined by the plaintiffs declined to answer whether liability insurance had been obtained through the plaintiff corporation or through the defendant corporation. He asked the court to review the documents for which privilege was claimed. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue.
d_2003nssf2.txt,"The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. The Ontario Court had previously granted a consent order incorporating an agreement between the parties purporting to divide matrimonial assets.

The Court has jurisdiction to vary the consent order of the Ontario court. A divorce action is commenced in Nova Scotia on the basis of the respondent's claim for divorce and division of matrimonial assets. A consent order is a contract and must be treated as such. This applies whether the Nova Scotia court has jurisdiction or vary a consent order made by reference to the respondent.

b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order for the reverse of the child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by the Act; Cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; Variation of access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the Children. HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that the respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order and that access had not been a problem in the past. The Court ordered that upon the payment of $5000 on account of the arrear accrued prior to December 31, 1998, the balance of the Arrears accrued to such date shall be extinguished. It also ordered that the petitioner should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purposes of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school.

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","An application for judicial review of a labour arbitrator's decision that the wording of collective agreement was wide enough to encompass the situation. The court found that the arbitrator’s decision was patently unreasonable. The appellant had been erroneously placed at the bottom of the departmental seniority list due to another employee with greater departmental strength who was also a hotelier. The respondent had breached Article 9:01 by reducing hours for employees on the front desk of the hotel by 25% due to a personnel change. The employee who had been given less hotel seniority than the appellant was the one who should have had their hours reduced. She subsequently filed a grievance alleging that the reduction of her work hours constituted a violation of Article 9. The arbitrator referred to Article 11:01 which defines lay-off as an indefinite discontinuation of employment, and to s.5(h) of the Arbitration Act. The parties’ agreement to not allow an indefinite reduction of hours in the department was breached by the decision of the arbitration board. The applicant was awarded the amount of the award plus the costs of the judicial review and the application for the assignment of the additional hours by the appellant to the hotel and the associated associated costs. The hotel was also granted the order of the court on the basis of the privative clause provisions under s. 42(2) and s. 5(h), of the Trade Union Act."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. In his appeal, the Crown argued that the trial judge misdirected himself to acquit the respondent if he believed that the appellant's speed was less than 100 km per hour. HELD: The Crown's appeal was dismissed. The Court held that the Crown had not erred in law. The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. The errors of law were not the only ones to be found. The court found that the respondent did not mistake the facts for dangerous driving and did not confuse the issue of speed with that of the actus reus or mens rea of the offences. While excessive speed can constitute dangerous driving, it does not necessarily be a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person at that time of day on a stretch of roadway assuming that there were no construction workers or equipment in the area."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. They sought an order pursuant to Rule 188 that the entirety of the plaintiff's claim stand dismissed; the entirely of the claim against the Attorney General; and the Claim against the Chief of Police and Persons designated to prosecute the alleged offences. The action was commenced within the limitation period as provided in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act. The trial did not proceed to conclusion because the Crown entered a stay of proceedings. The matter was adjourned sine die.HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the other below were set aside. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. 2)With respect to the first issue, the Court of Appeal held that the limitation time should not be extended as it was not an adequate time to resolve the matter. 3)The Court of Justice reviewed the various previous decisions and found that the limitations on action relating to the plaintiff were not extensions of the time frame set out in the legislation. The limitation period was not extended beyond 1 year. 4)The Appeal Court rejected the application for an extension of the limitation on the basis of s. 579(1) of The Public Officers Protection Act which provides for a determination of a point of law. 5)Limitation of actions are substantive in character as opposed to procedural and their provisions provide for a factual component. The Court found that absent an agreed statement of facts, there should be no order granted under Rule 188."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. Here, the conditional nature of the debt under the GIC was not a conditional one. To constitute an attachable debt, there must be an actual debt, legal or otherwise, which can be paid to a third party within the time period specified in the terms of the garnishing order."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","HELD: The court ordered joint custody of the child with shared parenting with the mother. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the mother's decision to move with the child to Yukon. The evidence from the trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined in the original custody judgment. The mother had been vociferous in opposition to the father's application for custody, but she had now indicated that she would prefer to be closer to his family. The increased contact with her extended family in the Yukon provides an increased social network that would be in the child's best interest. The Court found that the mother had not rebutted the father’s application for sole custody, and that she hoped to move away from Saskatoon because it was more remote and with fewer transportation options than Saskatoon."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing them. These orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The Board conceded that two exceptions to the general rule that an error of law must appear on the face of the record were that it had not addressed the relevance of several of the documents sought by the plaintiff. Wal- Mart Canada sought the production of additional documents pursuant to s. 9 of The Trade Union Act. The plaintiff union objected to the subpoenas and sought production of documents referred to by the defendant in the subpoena. The defendant refused to supply the plaintiff with the documents and the plaintiff's affidavit was struck out. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. Counsel for the corporate parent corporation (which was not a party to the original application) acknowledged the limited role the Board had on judicial review of one of the orders but declined to comment on the offending provisions. The application for a declaration that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over the discovery and production of non-custodial documents (including those sought by plaintiff's affidavits) was not allowed and the court ordered the plaintiff to provide a written decision respecting any document discovery or production order that it might make in response to plaintiff's application for certification. Further, the plaintiff failed to provide written reasons for the decision."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a 2 year, 2 month prohibition from selling insurance on behalf of the defendant. The termination of the sales agent's contract provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month and renewal compensation calculated in respect to renewals, based on average renewals. The defendant did not seek to justify the termination on the basis of cause. Rather, it sought to use the plaintiff's success as a sales agent as a factor in determining the appropriate period of notice. The dismissed employee, who had been employed with Allstate for 26 years, had made little effort to secure alternative employment. Awarding the plaintiff 20 months salary, that (1) there was no month for which he had not been compensated, without notice, by the defendant; and (2) that the failure of the terminated employee to accept the non-competition clause had no part in his termination."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were in a relationship for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement with the children every second weekend. The husband objected to the arrangement because the children were primarily in his care. The parties had little face to face communication and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests regarding the children. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is inappropriate for these children, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in their best interest. The children have been in the wife's care for approximately three years. Their level of education is not high. They have become familiar with the structure and routine he has put in place for them. They do not exercise much of their time and attention. They are unable to manage their finances. The court was satisfied that the wife was unable to provide the necessities for the children while they were in their care. Joint custody is appropriate, but not in the best interest of the children, given that the children will be exposed to the violence in their lives."

Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearings pending a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing would not result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on a conviction and the accused will not have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act (the Commission is restricted to dealing with licenses or permits, to the exclusion of any other type of penalty). There is nothing inconsistent with the respondent Commission considering a form of disqualification of the appellant's license or permit, while the stateexercises its criminal law power with respect to thesame set of facts."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective counsel of the complainant. The matter was remitted for an appeal to be tried on a trial basis. The appellant had chosen to represent himself and had not received the assistance of a lawyer. The lawyer had been a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan and was not qualified as an agent at trial. The accused elected to forego the right to rely on the advice of the lawyer and instead chose to rely upon the counsel of a person who was self-represented. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of the fresh evidence before the Court. The appeal will be allowed.

The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff, now 30 years old, joined the action of his own insurer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The Court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to the victim and that he retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration for him to show that he was still the owner of the vehicle. HELD: The Court awarded the all inclusive sum of $162,500. It held that the Court could not find either of the defendants or the plaintiff's signature on the statutory declaration on the evidence. As the plaintiff testified at trial that he had no idea who the person who had given him the van was, but that he recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to report the location and license number. It was not immediately clear what the person that had given the plaintiff the van belonged to. The inconsistencies in the defendant's evidence concerning his admitted poor memory of the events that occurred within the general time frame of late November to late December gave rise to a number of credibility issues. However, the Court was not able to locate either of them."

At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","HELD: The accused was found guilty on five counts of possession and sale of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and one count of assault contrary to S. 267(a) of The Highway Traffic Safety Act. The evidence was excluded from the trial on the basis that the accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed. The Court reviewed the various types of evidence and found that the most common evidence was that of a small child in the back seat of a vehicle. The child was crying and the RCMP officer noted that there was a large amount of marijuana in the car. The strong smell of marijuana was also heard by the accused as she put the vehicle in drive and pulled the hood of the vehicle over. The accused did not have to avert her eyes from evidence of activity, whether criminal or otherwise, that could be observed by any vigilant member of the public. The court recognized that the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. This includes the pursuit of vehicles. The police are authorized to make certain inquiries and need not turn blind eye to matters which legitimately raise their suspicions. The Crown did not believe the accused when she stated that she was under arrest for possession of marijuana."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have the solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a conflict of interest. The solicitor had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action were ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitor. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant was being consistent with a prior ruling involving a asimilar attempt to displace the solicitor's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. 2)The solicitor was not a member of that firm and had not been involved in any of the contractual matters before 1991. 3)Although a solicitor's role in representing a Crown corporation should have given him the benefit of the doubt, this was not such a case. All knowledge of the past and any knowledge of its strategy and internal policies and procedures in relation to the denial of claims should have been sought. 4)The only identifiable strategy adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.",The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argues that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and that the accused was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was lawful. The Court makes the following finding of the facts: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonably doubt that The Police were engaged In the lawful Execution of Their Duty when they resisted the arrest of the accused who is over 6 feet in height and weighs more than 3 hundred pounds. OC spray was used but had no immediate affect on the accused. The accused was eventually handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car.

A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility.

b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02 of the Rules) because there was little evidence available to assess the degree of overlap in the evidence. The court reviewed the rules, case authorities and material before it and found that, in addition to the usual remedies, consolidation was appropriate. The only remedy that could be considered was a trial of one of the defendants’ affidavits, which indicated that the matter would be tried in sequence. The defendant’s affidavits indicated that they intended to have the matters heard together because they believed that expert evidence would be appropriate. Although similar expert evidence was suggested, there was nothing before the Court to permit it to assess how similar and potentially duplicitous the evidence at four separate trials would be."

Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that a party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s.(63(6)) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions.

They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored.

The Court of Queen's Bench was too much concerned in the abstract with the potential scope of these provisions, fearing, as he did, that as one moved from the meaning of them at the centre to their potential meaning at the periphery, they reached beyond the contemplation of the legislature, especially in the context of the commission of an offence."

The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds the vehicle had been used in criminal activity.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court was not persuaded that the Director overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime or so forth.

SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The applicant applied for income replacement benefits for a period of time contending that the accident had not caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denied the claim. The applicant appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no doubt that for a significant period after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit calculated on a balance of probabilities.  2)Accident is defined in s.100(1)(a) as any event in which bodily injury is caused by an automobile. 3)The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balanced of probabilities on the basis of the evidence of two family physicians. Dr. Dindo was his family physician prior to the accident. He was generally in good health and had no evidence of any back problems. His family physician after the accident stated that the pain he suffered in June 1995 was caused from a compression of the root of his back which worsened his symptoms. His back pain worsened over the next few weeks and he was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniiation at the L5/S1 level. He appealed to Court pursuant pursuant to S. 197 and s.197. 4)The evidence was conflicting as to whether or not there was a disc hernniation. It took the position that the disc was not caused by the accident, but that the symptoms and symptoms of his disc hernitiation continued post-accident."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded.08 while awaiting a sample of the ASD test. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of count 2, over.08. The evidence did not support a finding of guilt on count 1. The observation period was not conducted properly. The police officer did not observe the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. Both samples were 100 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and the breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol. The accused did not attempt to call counsel at the roadside and declined to do so on two occasions. The Court of Queen's Bench decision in By did not rest on the facts."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff underwent a caesarian section to relieve herself of the pain and suffering caused by her prolonged bleeding. She was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital by ambulance on an emergency basis as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The defendant performed a successful hysterectomy. The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were not proven as a prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for irretrievable loss and for the pain, suffering and inconvenience resulting from her treatment and surgery. The court found that the Hysterectoromy was the most likely cause of the bleeding and that the surgical intervention which was performed would have been the preferable route. The Court found that in the circumstances, the hospital staff and the plaintiff were not called to explore any possibility of error. The surgical intervention was not the only method the plaintiff could have used to prevent the bleeding. It was also the method which the plaintiff would have chosen to pursue in the first place. The hospital staff were not required to participate in the surgical process as they were not authorized to do so."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). The accused's behaviour was misleading. The reasons for the dismissal of the charges were: 1)The accused was aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks and the circumstances permit; 2)The medical condition must make it either extremely difficult or extremely painful for the accused to obtain counsel once he indicates this wish; and 3)If an individual can't provide a sample by reason of a medical condition that is a reasonable excuse, the Court finds that the accused did not provide a reasonable one. The Court does not believe the accused's evidence on this point; even though the accused was diligent in attempting to reach counsel of his choice, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. No one was at the lawyer's number; and 4)Nothing registered on the intoxilyzer when he pressed the button to close the mouthpiece."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preservingand detaining all future production proceeds from those properties. The defendants filed affidavits in support of the application. The applicants sought to attach the words 'all outstanding debts, claims or damages' to the affidavits. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The applicants failed to meet the first test.  2)The court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as matter of fact. 3)If the court decides that a mandatory injunction can only be granted where the plaintiff shows a very strong probability that grave damage will accrue to him in the future, it must be carefully exercised to ensure that this damage does not occur again. 4)The Court must also consider the relative strength of the applicants case (that being their entitlement to compensation based upon the liens registered by them) when those liens are not before the court."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08. The accused denied that he was impaired, and offered a 'last drink' defence, that alcohol he drank just before driving was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer, but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on the impaired driving charge and on the over.08 charge. The Court rejected the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick and the accused's contention that they were not trying to evade the police officer. The evidence of Mr. Lehman was not accepted. The court found that the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. Based on the evidence presented, there was no reasonable excuse for not stopping and the fact that the defence offered a last drink defence, which rejected both the accused and accepted the evidence, that he did not try to evade this officer. There was no doubt the accused attempted to get away from the officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. After being observed walking through an area well known for street level drug trafficking, the accused was approached by dealers on the public street and arranged to purchase a single stone or rock of crack cocaine in a transaction that took mere seconds to complete for the consideration of a single $20 bill. When asked if he could see the street, he testified that he could not. The accused and another individual who purchased one stone of cocaine were both arrested within minutes of the alleged events near and at the trafficking location. The Crown alleged that the accused gestured to another place for the deal to take place and that this was common practice in the area. Accused found guilty on both counts. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. The appellant's evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine constituted enough evidence for the Crown to demonstrate constructive possession of the drugs."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 (1)(b) of the Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and he was transported to his home in Carlyle. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge was not prepared to set aside his decision. 2) On a review of the facts and circumstances and the law, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to the final determination. The standard of review was set forth in R. v. Helm (2011 SKQB 32), 368 Sask. R. 115 at paras. 19 and 20. 3) The accused was clearly informed of his right to consult counsel. He was also provided with a copy of the driver's licence, the vehicle registration and sobriety report. When the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned. The officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. There really was no similarity between the name 'Vaughn' and that of a relative who was known to him. It was most unlikely that some physical impediment caused the accused to make mistake. His speech was not slurred. 4) The respondent was not provided with the number for a telephone number to call free of charge."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appeals the respondent's demolition order. The respondent seeks a new appeal under s. 329(4) of The Cities Act. The issues on appeal are whether the quasi-judicial board erred by not confirming the November 2004 demolition order, but by allowing the respondent to bring forward a written proposal to the board committing to the operation of the building under a qualified professional property management firm with proven record and acting at arm's length to the applicant. The board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the Board of Police Commissioners of any information concerning the board's decision. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The board's order is confirmed. It is not appropriate to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they consider relevant on these questions. The Board acted in a reasonable and prudent manner in making its decision. 2) There is no error of law in allowing the Board to decide on the disclosure of the police files. 3) The Board was instructed by counsel for the City to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to 6 months from the date of the decision. It would be incumbent on the applicant to pursue other avenues including application to the Court for subpoena or other Order directing production of documents."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from the William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. The Director’s evidence consisted of three affidavits filed by the respondents. The respondent indicated that although the police seized a number of items, it was not the date of seizure as it was determined that the property was being used for unlawful activity. No drug residue was ever found around the toilet nor were any drugs or traces of drugs found elsewhere in the home. The evidence indicated that the respondent had purchased a truck from the RPS in 2008 and that it had been delivered to the defendant. The respondents indicated that they had purchased the truck from another company. The applicant indicated that she had not seen any of the vehicles approaching the house but that she assumed they had stopped by to pick up some product. The Respondent indicated that he believed that the vehicle was never registered in any of her names. The Court reviewed the statutory intent and purpose of s.35.1 and found that s.34.1 is the correct word to describe the legislation in its current form. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is an in rem remedy. The Act does not make expressly retroactive legislation. The starting point for the commencement of the forfeiture proceedings is not the day on which the Director became satisfied that the seized property constitutes proceeds of unlawful activity, rather than two years from the point of discovery. The present case is analogous to that of the former, although undoubtedly affecting past transactions, does not change the state of the law or the rights of the parties from what it was before the new law came into force."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure.

The parents of one child, who was born April 9, 1992, were ordered to pay $600 per month as child support in 1996. The father applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. HELD: 1) The father's application to vary was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. 2) The mother was highly critical of the father's decision to only work 3 months of the year as support. 3) On all of the evidence the father had indicated that he intended to continue with his employment/ownership of the company and only work three months of year, he failed to provide appropriate financial disclosure. The mother's request for costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information was not successful. 4) The court had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal is from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LabourRB, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. The issue is whether s. 5.3 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.; 1978, c. T-17, authorizes the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the words of s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power tomake interim orders: the existence of an application or complaint before the Board, and the presence of power in the Labour Board to makes final order in respect of the application. The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint' and 'final order or decision' in s. 4. The Board recognized it to be a jurisdictional question and treated it. Accordingly, the standard of review is whether the decision was correct, rather than patently unreasonable."

The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.

The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of.

There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the city had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. The defendant alleges that this ice and snow had built up along the edge of the road such that it acted as a ramp that lifted the truck up and over the guardrail to land in the excavation site. HELD: The application to add Saskatoon to the action is granted as requested. 1) The Court reviewed the pleadings and the proposed third party claim and found that the applicant had not filed material which established a prima facie claim against the city and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiff if the third party claimed was grafted onto the plaintiff's action.  2) The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it. It is not proper to assess evidence or to go into possible prejudice. 3) There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for a local authority to limit its liability. Section 154(1.1) of The Urban Municipality Act states that a city is not liable for damage caused by the presence, absence or insufficiency of any wall, fence, guardrail, curb, pavement markings or traffic control device or barrier. It has been noted that there is a causal connection between the cause of action pled in the statement of claim and the actions taken by the defendant on that behalf. 4) However, no causal connection has been established between the causes of the damage and the defendant's application."

The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","HELD: The appeal was allowed.

The amount owed to March 23, 2016 was $372,444.48 and was protected by s.3 of the Land Contracts (Actions) Act. The respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the appellants. The issue in Andrew (CA) was whether or not the Court's decision in Mayoh (1988) was the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The court found that the application of s. 2 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act should be liberally applied to the sale proceeds (the sale proceeds are to be applied to both the purchase money and non-Purchase money balances) and that a percentage owing on both purchase and purchase money debts should be used to determine the deficiency judgement. 2)The conclusion in Andrew would not have been made had the Court considered Hrynewich Holdings in its entirety. The remaining LCRA protection against arrears of interest was decreased to $1,066.23. 3)The respondent was granted a mortgage to the Bank of Montreal following a consolidation of debts that included purchase money mortgage debt. At that time, the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72 and the property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent.

The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence.

The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tender and the 1985 invitation for tenders was inconsequential. The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks, ditches, railway tracks and roadways as required by the contractual provisions of the contracts and to provide the services it performed under them, and as extras, and for which it had never been paid. The contract was terminated without prior notice by the defendant."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had stopped living with the child since January 2010 and had not seen the child for two to three weeks. The mother was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child and that she would be in danger of physical harm if she were left in the care of the father. The Father did not admit to any threats to harm the child nor about his placing her in situations where there were peanuts. HELD: 1) The evidence was inconclusive as to whether the father had threatened the mother with removal of the child. 2) The father was not to be under the influence of marijuana 12 hours before and while he was in his care. 3) The child was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be better prepared to parent the child in the future. The evidence did not suggest that he could not learn how to properly care for his child. 4) Joint custody does not mean that one parent has the right to micro-manage the daily care of a child by the other parent. The fact that the father is from another country and still has family in Kuwait and is concerned he has threatened the child with removal would not be sufficient reason to order supervised access. The nature and extent of the conflict between the parties must be analysed to determine if joint custody is in child's best interest.

After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","The appellant sought damages for negligent misrepresentation and wrongful dismissal. The trial judge found that the defendants were negligent, but awarded damages equivalent to 5 months notice for wrongful dismissal and 5 months for wrongful dismiss. The appellant cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to her failure to mitigate her loss. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the action on the basis that the misrepresentation was not 'negligent'. In any event, the term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort. The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the trial judge's finding that there were misrepresentations by the employer and that they were negligently made. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that although the appellants had misrepresented the nature of the employment opportunity, they had given the respondent an honest performance review which showed that if she did not fit into the corporate culture within a year, she would be dismissed without cause on one month's notice."
