1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, by-laws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The applicant argued that the test in American Cyanamid does not apply to this case. The appeal Division found that the respondent would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted and that it is against the public interest and the interest of other members of the Association to allow someone, who has been convicted of serious charges, to indefinitely postpone the imposition of a penalty. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. An interim injunction was granted."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed, that it was a weapon as defined in the Code, and that the appellant intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death to persons."
1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the R.S.N.S.' 1967, and now s. 192 of the Regulations made under the Act. The trial judge found that s. 174 (now s. 193) of the Act was in violation because the Crown did not have any requirement to prove accuracy of the scales. The respondents appealed. Dismissing the appeals, that on the strength of the evidence, it was shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was operating his vehicle well above the permitted weight and tolerances on highway, and that the fine imposed by the trial judge was not saved by s. I. Charter."

She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in the City of Regina. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was found to have a whiplash injury which had a period of about one year following the accident. She suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Her physical therapist was not called to testify. HELD: The proper level at the time of the accident was $18,000.  1)No weight was given to the physical therapist's conclusions as to her present level of disability. 2)The proper level was at that time in 1988. 3)Costs were allowed in respect of the pecuniary damages. 4)The plaintiff's loss of housekeeping capacity was adequately compensated by the non-pecuniary damage award. 5)She was awarded costs of the action to be taxed."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would pay the plaintiff a deposit and service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000) and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens and argued that it was neither an enforceable contract nor timeliness of the trial process. Awarding the defendant the money, that there was no evidence of irregularity or delay between the parties and that the defendant apposed to the default agreement."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. HELD: 1)The Court ordered the defendant to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if the defendant was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens was in fact, indebted to Bawoline as he now says he was at the time of the contempt. 3)The judge ordered the liability to be taxed."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendant medical doctors. He claimed damages arising from the negligence of the two defendants. The plaintiff was impaled on an iron fence for approximately 25 minutes. He slipped and became impaled while climbing the fence. He was hospitalized for 22 days. Three of the defendants medical doctors testified as to their treatment of him. The medical records showed that the plaintiff was seen hanging upside down on the fence for about half an hour before being taken to the emergency department. The attending physician examined the plaintiff, examined the wound well, did not give appropriate instructions on discharge, and the wound was left open for another 10 to 15 minutes. After this period of time, the plaintiff experienced pain and suffering, and required hospitalization. The Plaintiff's disability was mild and he did not appear to have been in shock. The defendants and each of them did not fall below the standard of care required of them in the treatment of the plaintiff. Further the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendant but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered. The Court accepted that the defendants were not negligent in the manner in which they were dealt with in this case. While admission to hospital is always an option, there was nothing here that warranted admission. Furthermore, nothing indicated debridement of the wound. The discharge recommendations were appropriate and within the standard for an emergency room physician."

Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other young men who joined the attack on the accused were also sentenced to probation.

The court also imposed conditions on his probation. Amongst many aggravating features of the offence, the accused was found to be at a crossroads."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence set aside. 1)It was not necessary to retry the case in any event. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right and the test that s.11.1 (3) was based on the Sparrow test. 2)The trial judge did not go on to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. The issue was whether the limiting legislation was a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and, if so, whether it was justifiable. The appellants had failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test. 3)The focus has shifted to the limiting legislations in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The decision was set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law."

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent had two children from two prior relationships. The eldest resided with her mother in Swift Current and the youngest lived with her father in Edmonton. In June 2002 a consent judgment was issued by the Court providing that the petitioner would have custody of the child subject to an agreement with respect to the respondent having reasonable access to the child. The consent judgment provided that the respondent would have reasonable access every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening and one week in each of July and August. The respondent had previously refused to allow the child to exercise access to his father. The petitioner now applied for an order prohibiting the petitioner from moving to Edmonton to live with his father and seeking an order for the respondent to vary the access arrangements with the child such that the child will refer to the father only if the father wishes to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the father receive 90 days' written notice. He was informed verbally of the proposed move in September or early October. It was finally decided that it would be in the best interests for the child, who was now under the care of his mother, to be moved from Swift Current to Edmonton where he would have immediate access to medical therapy, consultation with his psychiatrist and advanced modes of therapy including scholastic, which are only available in Alberta. 2)The child had been experiencing problems at home and at school and was in the process of taking Ritalin, suspecting that he suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The Ritaline did not have the desired effect and the child was referred to a psychiatrist. Different medications have been prescribed and at present, the child is taking Zyprexa which is an anti-psychotic medication. The mother has been advised that there is no one in place to provide the counselling and treatment that she requires. In addition, she is seeing an education psychologist."

The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Constitution Act was not a reasonable ground to strike the claim. It held that, in the clearest of cases, where it is plain and obvious that the applicant's statement of claim is not justiciable, the appeal should proceed as an application to strike and the claim must not be dismissed summarily."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance and a further appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal board. The Board found the applicant was 'a person in need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act (ESIA). The Board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was then sent to the Department of Community Services, who refused to comply. The Department then contacted the applicant's counsel and the applicant appealed the Board's decision and the application was subsequently reinstated. In December 2007 the Department sent notice of ineligibility to the applicant based on non-disclosure.The applicant had costs in the amount of $750. The court granted the application for an order pursuant to mandamus. It found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. There was no other legal remedy, equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate, and the duty owed must not be discretionary, either in law or statute, and may be established either at common law or in statute."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with fishing without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and four other offences under s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of the regulations. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s 27 of the act. There is a strong presumption that the accused has a valid fishing licence and therefore there is no prohibition in effect. The only issue that the Court could find was whether the Minister had the authority to revoke the applicant's licence. The accused had a fishing licence issued in June 2009 issued by Vendor 36640 in Prince Albert, but his licence was revoked in September 2009 by the Fisheries Act. In that case, the restriction would have taken effect on the date the registered post office receipt was returned."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in part. The accused was convicted of assault contrary to s.(1)(a) the Criminal code. The judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan found him guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, judge of that Court quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge was correct in his reasons. While the accused's mistake of fact was reasonable, he would not have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate, the Court found that the officer in question was not the same person as the accused and that he should have taken steps to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation more quickly. The trial judge also addressed the fact that the accused was not touched by the officer and that the second officer was not touching the accused."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were in joint custody of the respondent and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.  1) The respondent was working and lived in a common law relationship. The parties' relationship, co-parenting and communication with each other deteriorated. The respondent's recent move to Alberta had had an adverse effect on the children. The children had the most stability and were receiving the most structure and support in their educational endeavours. 2) The custodial disposition is a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. 8 of The Federal Child Support Guidelines (Divorce Act Regulations, s. 9(a)). 9(c) contemplates broad discretion in determining the proper award. The Court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children."
2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the Husband would have interim sole custody. In 1997 the Wife was diagnosed with unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She had just undergone treatment for depression. She was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now lived in Saskatoon. He changed jobs. The child attended kindergarten each morning and was with the husband's sister each afternoon. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that it constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk of a child exists). In this province, that means obtaining a pre-trial date for pre- trial conference and if the matter is not resolved at that stage, proceed to trial where the Court will determine what is in the best interests of the children."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife was left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. The husband owned some assets but his share was only $2,000 as he was quick to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. HELD: The husband was awarded judgment for $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960. 1)The matrimonial home was once again divided equally between the parties. This time it was jointly owned with the mother and therefore exempt. The wife's house, jointly owned by her mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. 2)The children were to be given one-half of the only asset the family had during the marriage and the other half accrual to a Sun Life policy during the same period valued at $1 million.  3)The husband was to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home or to rental accommodation.  4)The court accepted the claim that the house jointly owned in the mother's home as protection in case he met someone is exempt. 5)The wife had obtained a grade 12 equivalency and was engaged in training. She held down two jobs. One as noon hour supervisor in the school system and one as office cleaner at night. Both had the benefit of the matrimononial home during themarriage. Both were in short financial problems.  5)Had the wife not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs because the petition made no property claims whatever.  6)It might seem that this case would fit squarely under subparagraph (b) am cautioned by counsel for the respondent that 'the children' in this context refers to children of this marriage and not to the five or ten holdovers from the wife's first marriage. The father was to have an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems but he would be even better off if he were to award the $25,000 against the home. However the claim was in its entirety, inequitable and had he not filed the counter petition he would have had no property claim whatever. The court was persuaded that the extraordinary circumstances did not impair the ordinary equity of the wife."

No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment. The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase. There was no-cross appeal by the owner. The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value. Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff adopted the suggestion and the work was done. 2) The plaintiff was liable for the cost of the extras. 3) The appraiser was not a party to the whole contract. She was only the appraiser's supervisor. 4) Although the plaintiff was not awarded judgment for all the extras he was responsible for, he was awarded a credit of $2,597.82.

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant entered into a two-year commercial lease with the intention of fixing the problem by arbitration. The landlord challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction to award damages. The tenant sought to quash the award on the basis that the arbitration clause in the lease was a limited arbitration clause. The arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine who had the duty to repair and to rectify the lease and to use other canons of construction including estoppel. The issues were: 1) was the jurisdiction open to the interpretation of any clause; 2) was it patently unreasonable; 3) whether the arbitration agreed with the tenants' rights; and 4) did the tenant mitigate its damages. Allowing the appeal in part, that although the arbitration clauses in both the Landlord and the Tenant leases were a limited and unimpeded jurisdiction, the decision of an arbitrator in the latter was not patently unreasonably unreasonable. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited one, which is why the award was awarded. The decision was based on an agreement between the parties that provided that disputes were to be settled by arbitration, but not disputes involving the clauses of the lease itself. The agreements were not contractually binding. The parties did not provide that claims be settled either by arbitration nor did they provide that all disputes arising out of the landlord/tenant relationship be settled via arbitration, including those disputes involving securitization of the property and the seizure of the assets by the tenant. The disputes were with respect to responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required. The dispute also involved a dispute about insurance coverage and whether insurance should be applied. The issue of liability for repairs was also within the scope of the arbitration."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The father, who was the only family member who could secure loans to pay for his daughter's education, applied pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the mother's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. The mother had secured several loans from the father, including one for the sole purpose of paying off her university debts. The father argued that the loans were part of his personal responsibility and that his sole recourse was to pay off the loans himself. Application to strike the application dismissed; the father had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only issue on this application was whether the additional loan payments were known or anticipated at the time of the corollo relief judgment. HELD: The father's application to strike was dismissed. It was well established that on an application pursuant to rule 14.5 to strike an action, a judge must proceed on the assumption that the facts contained in the pleadings are true and assuming those facts to be true, consider whether claim is made out. An order to strike all or part of a pleading is to be exercised with great care and caution and only in the most exceptional and clear circumstances. The application to vary in scope and in length should not be relied on as a basis for variation. It is plain and obvious that the applicant's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The fact that the application was made in the context of a complicated proceeding could lead to misinterpretation."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

As a corporation, a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609 (assuming for purposes of this discussion that Mr. Kitz is the proper officer to be examined on behalf of the company in such an action). The nature of the action is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the plaintiff as he is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action.

2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part (orally). It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but in these circumstances there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. A more significant issue is the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeitures of the vehicle used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account to the kid to pay the truck. He found that the truck was integral in the operation of transporting the respondent to various places across the country.

As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were in agreement that other family property be divided equally between them. However, due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. The grounds for divorce had been proven.

HELD: 1) The matrimonial property or its value, both as defined in s. 2, be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions, and equitable considerations mentioned in the Family Property Act. The evidence was accepted as it was as of the application. 2) The balance of the family property was not included in the family tree to be distributed as determined by the Court. 3) The appraised value of the home was $95,600.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for workplace stress. The appellant argued that the tribunal erred in determining that the workplace events and stressors required that there be work related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The appeal turned on one main issue: whether the policy, now adopted by the Board, was wrong to assess the nature of the workplace stressors from an objective point of view. WCAT also found that the respondent failed to give weight to the opinion of its treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to rebut that opinion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Board adopted policy 1.3.6 which applies to all decisions made on and after July 25, 2005. The policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under the GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The only issue which the Court raised was whether the Policy applied to the decisions relating to gradual onset stress claims under GECA. The respondent appealed. Appeal dismissed. There was no dispute about the standard by which we should review questions on appeal. The question of whether WCAT applied the correct legal test was reviewed for correctness. The issue raised by the second and third grounds of appeal was reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. The Court reviewed the history of decision making and found that there was no inconsistency with the approach required under the previous policy. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable having found there were unusual or excessive stressors in the workplace (the injured was not 'extraordinary and excessive' in comparison with the work related event or stressor experienced by the same worker in a similar occupation) and faced with the evidence of a 'personal injury by an accident' (s. 4(1)(a)(i)) and the causal link between those stressors and the worker's stress injury, she failed to draw that causal link. The evidence of the respondent's submission that there have been 'unusual and excessive"" workplace events in the past few months was found to be inconsistent with the standard set out in the Policy."
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed an order of the Director allowing the Tenant $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was damp and riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The Tenant testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the landlord used grey spray paint to resemble mould. When the mould first began to develop the Tenants called the Halifax Regional Municipality office, which sent a letter to the police inspector stating that he had observed mouldy conditions in the basement. He recommended a dehumidifier be placed in basement. Tenant moved out. Landlord's response was notice to vacate, with the result that the Tenante moved out and brought this application for compensation. Photographs of the mould caused by the landlords were placed in evidence. The condition of the premises was so poor that it was impossible to believe that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. The Director's findings were also disbelieved. The damages were much higher than the $862.50 awarded to the landlord on the basis that the furniture, area rug and clothing were ruined, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items, the plaintiff's damages were at a much higher amount."

The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an occupational health and safety charge under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant's failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist on the Farm at the time. The Court accepted the defendant's guilty plea and took into account the circumstances of the farm, his family and friends. The maximum penalty for a corporation violating the regulations under the Act is a maximum fine of $250,000. The farm was inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk and the defendant had taken steps to improve safety at his farm since the tragedy of Boake's death. He had made substantial changes to his farm in the wake of the tragedy, including building a new dairy barn. He was in no condition to operate equipment which he needed to remove the manure from the pit and placed himself at risk. Punishment should be mitigated by his lesser degree of culpability by virtue of his having no prior record for safety violations."

The Crown claims the trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The Court must consider the subjective and objective factors beyond a reasonable doubt. 2) The officer was entitled to consider the circumstance as whole and need not prove prima facie case. The evidence was that the accused stumbled and fell shoulder first into his truck as he turned around. Thereafter, the accused sat in his vehicle with the door open and his left leg out while he unsuccessfully searched for his driver's licence and registration. This is not a position from which swaying would normally be observed. The accused had difficulty walking or getting in and out of vehicles. The short route from Esterhazy to Stockholm is to proceed westerly. The U-turn, which was illegal, was conducted in order to re-orient himself. 3) The accused was found to have had a fair amount of difficulty walking and was in a state of confusion. He was in poor health and had difficulty finding his bearings. 4) There were no other indicia of impairment which could be considered objective evidence of impairment. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he was impaired by alcohol were subjective. The officer did not question the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle but, in the short observation period between the stop and demand, she was of the opinion that his ability to drive motor vehicle was showing signs of impairment and she consciously determined that she would not do an approved roadside screening device demand on him. She did not ask him to give up his car keys. 5) The evidence from the breath samples was that he had just swished with mouthwash because he had put some mints in his mouth. He admitted he had been drinking. 6) The Court was not satisfied that the breath sample evidence was sufficient to enable the objective test of reasonable grounds."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The matter required court time on two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. The Applicant was the successful party on the important parenting issue. The Court awarded costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra.

Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. She sought a rescission of the order in question on the authority of the Family Court on Rule 1.04 of the Rules. The Family Court upheld the appeal. Chipman, J.A. and Pugsley, JJ.A., concurring.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the plaintiff. The action was brought against the defendant, Hyndman, with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by the defendant from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to these leased vehicles. The defendant did not appear at trial nor did it enter defence to the allegations contained in the statement of claim. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)It did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff in an attempt to keep it operational were taken for the benefit of the company. As it turned out, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  3)The plaintiff's evidence did not establish that the defendant had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from the defendant. In fact the evidence indicates that the plaintiff gave notice to the plaintiff, Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchasing order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors with regard to the payment of these accounts. 4)The defendant was awarded taxable costs of the claim."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's canola crop on one occasion. The defendant denies liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs and together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. 1)Under the present legislation the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the plaintiff’s farm on more than one occasion and that other cattle were not in the field. 2)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the trial."

3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The injunctions as a whole sought to enforce certain restrictive covenant, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.  3) There was an important public interest in discouraging the unlawful activities of the respondents which the applicant had not established before trial. Relief quia tari under s. 117 requires the applicant to demonstrate strong evidence of imminent danger of substantial damage.  4) Danka has failed to establish a primae facie ground or even serious issue of substantial harm. The irreparable harm that Danka will suffer as a result of Brennan's acquisition of the applicant's business and services will be mitigated by the application of the injunctions. 5) The employment agreements respecting the sales and service of photocopiers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines were not executed by the respondent. The respondent employees were recruited by the applicant and its employees recruited from its sales and sales staff. The respondents crossed out the non-competition clause contained in their employee agreements. 6) The respondent employee is entitled to confidentiality and non-solicitation agreements. 7) Injunctive relief until trial is necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough. The applicant will not initiate any communication with these customers."
4_1994canlii3885.txt,"The Respondents contracted with the Department to care for a child and his Mother who was mentally disabled. After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in the home of the respondent. The mother was placed with the appellant and the respondent [M.H.] and the child was placed solely with the respondent (A.H.). The relationship between the mother and the children broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge erred in deciding the issue was simply to determine the best interests of the child. The trial judge should have started with the premise the natural relationship between mother and child ought to be preserved unless protection was needed and no evidence was ever put in jeopardy and the Child was not abandoned. As result the child's right to be secure in its relationship with its natural parent should not be disturbed. The contract should govern and if those who sign such a contract to supply custodial and support services are able to obtain custody, their dominating position vis a vis those with disabilities in their care would encourage predatory actions against the less powerful. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between the parent and child is not to be ignored in such a contest. 2)A trial judge's findings of fact and conflicting evidence do not influence the decision of the Family Court. This was not the case where a trierprite decision was made. The evidence was clearly supported by the expert's findings and the trial judge did not err in awarding custody to the respondent and not the natural mother. 3)Costs were awarded on the Queen's Bench tariff on trial and double Column on appeal."

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue.

The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.

The respondent seeks to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while in their father's custody. The Court reviewed the access provisions submitted for consideration at hearing the respondent. The issues before the court were resolved by mutual agreement. HELD: 1)The children's investment totems in the approximate amount of $2,000 were found to yield an appropriate return. 2)The respondent was to have sole responsibility and decision making authority for the day-to-day physical care and control of the children and the father's specific access.  3)The Court found that the present joint custody arrangement was not working well for the children.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act. The purpose of the sales tax assessment was to determine whether certain items were required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan. The documents were ordered on the same purchase order and were identified as separate items. The issue before the court was whether the word 'published' asused in s. 5(1)(b) of the Act was an independent purchase. If it was determined the purchase was an 'independent purchase', then the board's finding that the Appellant failed to meet the requirements of s. 8(1(f) was appropriate to the jurisdiction conferred by the Act. HELD: 1) The appeal is allowed. The decision is reversed.  2) The Board's definition of 'published', as used in the Act, is a matter of law reviewable by the Court. 3) The evidence before the Board is consistent with the findings made by the Board. There is no guideline or criteria for the taxing authority to apply. The findings of fact based upon an assessment are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 4) The Court's role is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not need to be determined by the board simply because it may be of different view. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which the book or technical paper is produced, distributed or made available, i.e., solely for educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes. 5) The application of the statutory requirements in this instance whether the documentation was required for preparation of the property for use is a question of law reviewed by the court.

4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision pursuant to s62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's employee had been shoplifting and was later charged with shoplifting. She sought and obtained a record of employment from the salon. The adjudicator rejected the employer's submission that the employee had frustrated or breached her employment contract, thereby releasing the appellant from any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. The employer appealed the adjudication's order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. His decision did not appear to be patently unreasonable because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. The appeal based on the submission the employer erred in law by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated or had not fulfilled its obligations was dismissed. 2)The employer acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of the employee's employment contract were and that Cajon had not done its obligations thereunder.

The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal. He was a guidance counsellor for the plaintiff's education complex from 1988 until 1990. He remained in that position until 1997, when he was terminated by the chief and band council. He now seeks damages for his wrongful dismissal claim. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year and his position was always uncertain. He had been involved in the planning, operation and maintenance of the complex's education facilities for several years. His employment was terminated in January 1997 when he did not strictly comply with the post secondary education reporting requirements of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada thereby putting the band at risk of possibly losing federal funding. 2)There was no evidence that the board members acted in a fashion inconsistent with their express or implied belief in the conduct of the employee. The fact that the report was prepared by the director of education and not by the plaintiff and was approved by the band council was sufficient to justify summary dismissal. The plaintiff's damages were limited to $12,394.22 and pre-judgment interest were calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in fact complete. The municipality appealed the certiorari decision. The land developer sought relief including an order in the nature of mandamus quashing the development officer's decision that the application was incomplete, an order of certifying the application is complete and a mandamus directing the developer to issue the final approval. Land developer appealed both the decision of the municipality and the mandamus. HELD: The application was set aside. On the same basis, the applicant was entitled to a declaration that the Application is complete.  1)The Municipality relied on s.278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The Applicant takes issue with the development officers' decision to declare the application complete and looks to this Court for relief. 2)The municipality has a different interpretation of the law. It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The Municipality has relied on a s. 278 of the MGI Act which provides that an application for subdivision approval is granted if the proposed subdivision is in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time complete application is received. The second requirement appears to be inconsequential. The first requirement is the very subject matter of this hearing."
4_2001nsca26.txt,"The appellants pled guilty to theft over $5,000. The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution in the full amount of the overpayment. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (1)years probation, restitution of one-half of the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appealed the judge's decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than one- half of the figure as submitted by the joint recommendations. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. The joint sentencing recommendations were accepted. The appeal was permitted. While the agreement between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the joint report was a fit sentence. There was no sound reason for the appellants to depart from it."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of property obtained by crime (s. 355(b)). The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused on three charges including possession of cocaine, cocaine and cocaine. The accused denied having anything in his possession, consented to the drugs being there, and admitted to having knapsacks in his car console when the police entered the vehicle. The police found a large amount of cash in the knapsack, which they found in the back of the defendant's car, and a large quantity of cash which they placed at his feet. At the police station, they found three rolls of cash containing $1000, a small amount of barley seed, a cash register rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash and a black wallet. The Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the possession of the accused knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: The accused was convicted of all three charges before the court.  1) The evidence was adduced by the expert evidence that the accused had knowledge of the presence of the item in question and consented its being there. The knapsocks were found in an open motor vehicle in an area of the wharf and were typical of what would be found in a possession of a person of such a personal nature. The barley seed was used to keep cocaine from clumping with moisture similar to putting rice in a salt shaker. The three rolls were found to be typical of the method used by drug traffickers, who not uncommonly have large amounts of cash to hold their proceeds of sale. 2) The cash found at the hands of a young male was found to contain marijuana and cocaine, which were found by the officer to be cocaine, a large number of cash, and three rolls containing $3000 in total. The cash was also found to have been given to the accused by the accused. 3) The Court accepted the evidence that a knappedack was found in his vehicle and, when entered into evidence, he changed his knuckles to show that he had access to it. It was obvious that he consented and he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle"
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.",The Government sought an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to proper defend the claim. HELD: The defendant was not entitled to strike the pleadings. The court was not prepared to strike any of the phrases complained of.  1) The pleadings do not meet the test of whether there is a foundation for the claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty in the pleading. 2) The evidence does not establish that the claim is based upon a general scheme of affairs as defined by the Education Act or any other Act or regulation applicable to the grant of a right of equitable equitable effect. 3) There is no evidence that the government put its own interests ahead of those of the other parties in the grant. 4) The defendant conducted itself with brutal and callous disregard and complete lack of care for the plaintiff and of his rights. The defendant knew or ought to have been aware of the probable consequences of its actions and the damages such actions would cause to the plaintiff. The administration was not able to afford the costs of the action.
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that the daughter was not living with her, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. She also filed affidavits from three friends and a 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either either alcoholism or lack of proper care, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence. Even if the hearsay evidence were admissible given the indirect denial by the daughter of either alcohol or lack thereof, there was no case for even direction of trial, let alone an order in favour of the father. The fact that the affidavits were based on hearsay rather than sworn or verified under oath, they should not have been considered. The appellant shall have leave to reapply on proper evidence if so advised."
4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and $500 against Sullivan. 1) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. Her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2) The court found no case law on point in this province and am unable to distinguish the actions of the defendant in Restauronics Services Ltd. v. Forster. 3) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. The Court held that the plaintiff in this case was entitled to no more than nominal damages and awarded it the money that was awarded. 4) The plaintiff was not in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. The position of Sullivan when he submitted his proposal was identical to that of the plaintiff. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of his company. He did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. The only issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed. The claim against PCS is dismissed."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children’s Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act. HELD: 1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short-term relationship and the fact that the applicant has demonstrated a prima facie case for establishing she is entitled to interim spousal support, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. 2) The respondent is in a position to pay some monies. There was no basis for an order preventing the applicant from taking the children outside the province in the short term. The issue of the respondent’ s.5(1) of the Family maintenance act, 1997. It is now well established in this jurisdiction the court can, and should, make an interim order for child support in disputed loco parentis cases where the applicant made out a primative case for entitlement. It was well established that the respondent, who was the biological father, should not be responsible for paying child support but rather, should be given full consideration. The respondent should pay the sum of $1,500 per month for a total of eight months. The Court ordered the respondent pay $2,350 per month."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On August 16, 2006, six days shy of the two year limitation period, the plaintiffs claimed that DDH, the female plaintiff had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendants sought particulars of the full extent of the injuries of the plaintiff, who was not fully recovered for her said injuries. HELD: The defendants' application was granted. Each defendant had furnished a draft order, very similar in substance to the one mandated by Rule 139. In this particular case, both the first and second reasons have merit. Both the defendants' right to deliver notice in writing to the plaintiffs requiring the plaintiffs to provide a further and better statement of the nature of their claim and better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given and such notices shall clearly state the particulars required. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was mutually agreed to between the respondent and the child. The petitioner claimed an interest in the standing crop but the respondent failed to give notice of the expert. HELD: 1) The respondent's income was $96,900 and the petitioner was entitled to one-half of the $178,800 gross farm land owned by the respondent. The farm partnership had three children of its own. The respondent owned one-third of the farm land and it is agreed that matrimonial property after partnership debts is $410,700.21. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the petitioner and the respondent will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support.  2) The petitioner's income should be fixed at $11,376.00 per year and the adjusted income at $25,721.07. 3) The Court was satisfied that the respondent's assets were still subject to the valuation of his property and therefore the Court would not order any additional support for the petitioner. 4) On the issue of the land, the respondent owned a piece of land which was owned by him other than his mother and his brothers. 5) The amount of the mortgage debt which had to be paid off by the petitioner to the respondent was $24,000 less the sum of $15,580 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 (being his land as opposed to his personal land and buildings) to be set aside for the purposes of the Guideline purposes.  6) The average capital cost on land was $1,200 less the amount of $13,580.00 (being land owned equally by the parties except for the landowner). The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent for $113,155.19 less one half of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent\'s personal land."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether s. 7 expenses should be retroactive given the child's limited income; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements set out in s.7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act. The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he was ordered to pay $293 as support for the child for the first time. In addition, an add-on was claimed pursuant to s. of the Federal Child Support Guidelines for expenses relating to [N.G.K.B.]'s child care, education and extracurricular activities. The issue of s. seven expenses was not an issue. The main issues related to the s. expenses and the retroactive of the support order were mixed. HELD: The child support ordered should be fixed at $1,500 with costs to be paid in full. 1) Retroactive child support should not be fixed. There was no blameworthy conduct on the part of the respondent who resides in Saskatchewan. He was ordered pay ongoing child support of $300 per month based on his gross annual income. The Court found that retroactive child tax returns should be set out. 2) The respondent was entitled to costs in a family law proceeding. He must pay his proportionate share of the ongoing costs of [N.'G.'K.'B.'s activities commencing October 1, 2002 and every month thereafter so long as she remains a child within the meaning of the Act."
5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. The appellant had argued that the employer referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time. The arbitrator found the phrase in question to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded in his ratio that: 1) these competing aids to interpretation do not find that the phrase 'any employer', in the context of this collective agreement, is an unambiguous one. am unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history. As result, the grievance is dismissed."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application.
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The father sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate. The issue was whether the wills were mutual and that no agreement against revocation could be implied. The daughter was acting on her own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation'. It was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of the successfulparty in the actual case. In light of the present position of the father and his daughter, those three parties will bear their own costs.  It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved a demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the Estate and the wills he drafted. The applicants, who were co-executors of his mother's estate, as well as the party who claimed one-half interest in the condominium, were now acting on their own."

Since the approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void and the defendants were not liable for any breach of the contract. The alternative claim was that Nova was entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment since it supplied a sign which had been used for the benefit of the defendants since May 1987.

Nielsen & Stolar (1988) 1 S.C.R. 480. 1) The fresh evidence rule has been stated many times and is summed up in [1980] SCC. The same rule should apply with respect to an order refusing to terminate an order for permanent care and custody. 2) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases. 3) On special grounds inspect or view any place, property or thing."

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.

It was not appropriate to make any decision on the same basis as in the case at bar.  4)The only documents to be considered were the notice of motion, the statement of claim, the particulars furnished pursuant to demand, and any document referred to in the claim. 5)As the third parties did not establish that the impugned claim could not succeed, the application was also dismissed."
6_2001nssc105.txt,"The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land. The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract. Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff broker for the defendant real estate brokerage firm applied for and was awarded a commission of 10% on the basis of selling the lots at a rate of 6% less the commission on the previous sale. The plaintiff brought an action against both the broker and the vendor for breach of contract and unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The defendant sought costs from the solicitor on that issue. HELD: The plaintiff was granted costs on the first and third stages of the application. In the absence of an enforceable agreement between the parties, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. The court found that the respondent had put a time stipulation on the proposal which did not occur in the circumstances. The commission was 10% inclusive of project management, commission structure negotiable and the vendors would be compensated for all of the work the client would do.

6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant commenced an action against the respondent physician alleging negligence in the performance of a circumcision. The respondent had performed a circumcision on the appellant three days after the appellant went into the emergency department complaining of pain. The appellant underwent a circumcision himself, at which time the appellant began to complain of pain and suffering. A trial judge refused to appoint a court expert and ordered the appellant to answer interrogatories that required his opinion, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent and the medical treatments he provided to the appellant. In performing the circumcision, the appellant was twice required to provide medical files, a complete medical file, a summary of all of the medical reports and other documents filed by the appellant and the respondent on his behalf. In refusing to appoint an expert witness, and in refusing to order the appellant's physician to answer certain interrogatories concerning his treatment, the issue was raised. Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part per the reasons for the trial judge's decision in Madore v. Ibrahim. The chambers judge considered the issue of opinion and, in doing so, erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answer an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the appellant cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician to the applicant even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment. The issue of whether the opinions sought by the interrogatories in this case are opinions which CPR 19 requires be provided and whether the appellant is entitled to re-answer them, even if this requires the physician to provide a properly supported and articulated objection to answering any particular one as he may be advised, which he may do with respect to other interrogatories seeking opinions about the respondent's care of the appellant rather than Dr. Miller's treatment of him. HELD: The appeal is allowed. While the chambers judge gave insufficient weight to relevant matters, whether all relevant circumstances were brought to the attention of the Chambers judge and whether he misapprehended the facts, this Court was satisfied he erred in not asking the appellant what the appellant had done in performing the first operation and why it was necessary for him to do second corrective surgery.  1) While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions the appellant should attempt to use language that can be understood by his listeners and the court. This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles were applied or manifest injustice has resulted.  2) The appellant was awarded"
6_2002nssc288.txt,"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a motor vehicle accident in a different jurisdiction, applied for directions in the matter of the determination of a question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01 and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; whether there are police reports; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors; whether they were located. The plaintiff's choice of forum will be determined according to the law of the province of Quebec. The court had not considered the factors set out in O'Brien vs. Attorney General of Canada and Oakley vs. Barrie, and have considered the factual submissions that have been made on behalf of the respondent in this application. HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. The Court was in a bit of a quandary as to whether the applicants had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice and whether that right was subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non convenediens or, alternatively, a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. There was no difficulty in the application process. The only difficulty was that the applicants appeared to have argued a determination of question of statute but the respondent had not really made any submissions. The applicant did not provide a lot of information about the circumstances around the accident, whether anybody investigated the accident; whether any of them were witnesses; whether their residence was located; whether so, where they were, whether they might be seen. There were a number of problems with the application, but the court concluded that the plaintiff should have chosen Nova Scotia because it is a forum conveniens community. If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place of trial in Nova Scotia. There is no reason to automatically expect a judge presiding at a trial in the province to be the interpreter of the law in the absence of so many facts and witnesses likely to be called on behalfof the defendant. If a procedural issue arises, the Court concluded that Nova Scotia is forum a conveniens and dismissed the action."

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the child have been resolved. The child is the biological child of the parties and his mother is the respondent. The question of the child's status was determined based on common sense, that parental status is earned over a reasonable passage of time. Even an expressed intention to assume responsibility would not be sufficient in some cases of very short marriages especially those involving an active natural parent. The actions of the stepparent in adopting (not in the legal sense) the child as his own combined with the complete absence of the natural father and the decision to cause the child to believe that the step-parent was the natural parent has resulted in an increase in his contact with the other. This was an important decision."

6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750, and secured debt of $150,000. The bankrupt argued that he had been insolvent since 2002 and that his cattle operation had been discontinued due to a severe drought. He sought a conditional order of discharge in the amount of $8,000 in addition to surplus income. SCU cross-examined the bankrupt and raised questions about surplus income obligations. The bankruptcy judge found that the bankrupt had committed vexatious errors and errors in law, and there was no evidence he had consented to the discharge. He was entitled to have his day in court and to be heard by an impartial decision-maker. The court found that this was a very difficult case because of the conflicting interests at play. The creditors' interest in obtaining a fair recovery on their sizeable debts, the bankrupt's need to rehabilitated, and safeguarding the integrity of the bankruptcy system itself. Having carefully considered all of the facts, the existence of multiple s. 173(1)(b) and (c) grounds, and his personal circumstance and his ability to pay, the court found it appropriate to impose a conditional Order of discharge of $10,250 in addition/max. This sum was to be paid at not less than $300 per month with right of pre-payment. The onus was on the objecting creditor to prove the existenceof s.173(1) if it was not otherwise reported by the trustee. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s.172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The Court held that it would be unfair and unjust to allow the bankrupt to receive his discharge without making a sizeable contribution to his creditors. As the bankrupt was self-represented and had limited income, the Court found that s.175(1(d) did not apply to him. He should be able to comply with this order within three years, which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a condition of his discharge."
6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father.

The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in together. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which could not be explored. The petitioner asks that the principal residence be varied and awarded to the respondent. HELD: 1) The respondent is 34 years of age and has four older children of other relationships. He abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the past two years have made him non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. There are three children of the marriage, two of whom are now in assisted living. Despite his physical injuries, the respondent has made it clear that he will make a positive change in the next six months. He has made an effort to improve his living situation. The respondent has been a positive influence on the parties' children. The Court found that the respondent is a model parent. He is responsible for the care of the children and has made a significant effort to ensure their safety and that of their families. The court found that it is appropriate for the respondent to have primary residence with the petitioner. 2) The parties met at a settlement conference. The parties lived together for a short time. They moved to live in a mobile home in the evenings. The husband is employed full-time and is currently assisting the mother with renovations. Despite being physically injured, he is assisting with the renovations. The boys live with their mother. 3) The petitioner is a stay-away mom. She is expected to plead not guilty. 4) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the respondent professed to have no intention of pursuing mediation with the parties, he has abdication a significant portion of his parenting role to the petitioner mother and has been heavily dependent upon others. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. This never occurred, purportedly because the respondent was unable to afford it. The judge has not shown any willingness or willingness to facilitate the best interests of each party and the child to take the next step in their relationship."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. The accused is a repeat Violent and Sexual Offender who was in prison for 15 years. He is currently serving his sentence for a sexual assault charge and was out on parole. HELD: The accused was granted one recognizant. The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, and indeed Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years are reasonable. The only issue to be determined is whether that objective person agrees with the accused's subjective belief that he will commit the offence. Although the accused has 59 prior criminal convictions and is a high risk to re-offend sexually, there are a number of factors that suggest there is a real risk that he may re- offend. The fact that he is in the penitentiary and that there are three escapes from lawful custody at the same time speaks to his lack of self-control and impulse behaviour. Although he has had some success in escaping custody, there is still a real danger that he could re-Offend and that his security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions or lack thereof while in prison. There is also the issue of access to programming and access to counselling."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has failed to establish a genuine Issue for trial. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on those attacking the will. The test in Quaintance is based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. 3) Where there are suspicious circumstances (such as a lack of testamentary capacity or the presence of undue influence) such as this one will affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption. The Court is satisfied that this is the case where the rebuttable presumption, which casts an irrelevant burden on the challenger. It is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is a genuineIssue to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge is based, such as lack of a testamentary memory or the absence of undue undue influence. 4) It is pertinent to note that one of the deceased's daughters was also named in the challenge. She deposed that during one of her visits to the nursing home, a real estate agent telephoned the deceased and told her that he was unable to deal with the matter, because of his health. The deceased had recently died in hospital and it was difficult for her to visit him. She also stated that she observed her father being very emotional and appeared to be unaware of his surroundings. The application was also dismissed because the applicant had not shown sufficient initiative to prepare the will in such a fashion as to require trial."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court was not hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of settlement unless there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of a party or the minutes of a settlement are too vague to enforce. 2)The fiat ended all negotiations. The appellant was bound by her agreement as of its value. 3)The appellant was to produce a statement of the value as of the date of the application."

Dismissing the appeal, that although the stop was arbitrary, it was justified because it was a routine stop and the driver was asked to come to a stop in response to an appropriate order, signal or direction, the Crown had no claim to the breath sample evidence, and the respondent had no right to retain and instruct counsel."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable the issue will finally put an ending to the proceedings. The Court in Beddow also emphasized the importance of credibility in the quantum portion of the trial. In a review of recent cases, the Court held that a jury that had been recalled to assess damages could be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of the Trial. This was a case where it was arguable that the plaintiffs may well be disentitled from their right to have a trial with a jury decide what is the appropriate quantum of liability."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.

The bankrupt argued that the business failure combined with pressure from creditors such as the Michaluk's caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. The causes of bankruptcy as set out in the s.170(1) report are failure of business, Directors obligations, pressure of creditors and increased taxation. HELD: A conditional order was granted for $1,750.00 from any source to which the bankrupt could be compelled to pay. 1)The facts under s.172 were determined to be relevant and the matter was interlocutory.  2)The bankrupt's claim was for $166,359.72 which represented net goods and services tax assessed for the period January 1, 1991 to July 31, 1992 and $14,223.30 for unpaid personal income tax for the 1991 taxation year.  3)There was no evidence to support the bankrupt's defence that the tax exemption was unnecessary.  4)The debtor was denied the right to defend himself or his company against tax claims.  5)The court was not satisfied that the principles and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of the unpaid remittances in these bankrupt's bankruptcies. 6)Application for discharge granted in respect of the discharge of the bankrupt.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonal. The question is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intention to do so. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The judgment is dismissed. 1) The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the applicant actually recovered. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. 2) It is common ground that Gari took possession of the building and rented it out for storage. These actions on its part reflect the terms of its lease with Lakeland. The Credit Union did not advance a claim either in trespass or on a basis that s. 65(5) of the PPPA itself creates a cause of action. The analysis of the parties' positions must proceed on that same basis, i.e. that, as of September 1, Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal is a separate action and should not be taken as a substitute for a remedy. If the issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari."

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed that she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence of drugs seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. She sought exclusion of the evidence or a mistrial. Application for return to pre-trial steps taken by the accused, including not re-electing a judge by mistake, and undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the trial, had been inadvertent. Mistrial would result in the accused returning to a pre-prejudice position, while preserving her right to remain silent. The accused made important tactical decisions regarding the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her undertaking to testify if her motion to dismiss was not dismissed at the end of her trial were unsuccessful. These strategic decisions were important to her and, in fact, affected her ability to make full answer and defence. The Court held that it was impossible to cure the prejudice of late disclosure by an order requiring the accused to re-examine her prior decisions regarding undertakings and agreements. While not perfect, it could be said that the disclosure of new evidence can lead to the prejudicial effect of a re-election, which could not be cured. The trial judge's decision to not to grant an order for the discovery of the new evidence had a significant effect on the accused's credibility. The fact that the complainant had negotiated with the Crown to disclose this evidence to her prior to her election only made it more relevant to her. The Crown has made it clear that it will not adduce or exclude the evidence which was already out there. It is not necessary to change the law to exclude it from the record. The complainant's right to reelect as judge and jury member was not breached. The disclosure of this new evidence should be allowed, but not by the Court and not in this trial."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not meet the sufficiency of claim. The AGC argued that the defendant's conviction and seizure of property in 1996 did not create a cause of action because the plaintiff did not attack the validity of the 1996 warrant and restraint orders. HELD: The plaintiff's amendment to paragraph 16 did not comply with the rules of the Court. The Court concluded that the accused has a causeof action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the defendants' pleadings."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. They have shared parenting. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. He worked part-time and sold Pampered Chef products. Following separation, the petitioner was primarily a stay-at-home parent who earned a mean income of $4,128. HELD: 1) The parties agree that the meeting is without prejudice. The respondent indicated that he would not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and indicated that it should terminate June 27, 2013. There will be an order granting the respondent interim exclusive possession of the family home.  2) While it may be that parties in a shared parenting arrangement reach a consensus on a number of issues, the Court must be guided by the factors set out in the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985 and the specific facts of the situation at hand. Having regard to the cashflow of the parties, the court ordered that the last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit A of Exhibit B are struck. They are the formal conditions of the privilege and are tools that the court may have regard to.  3) The respondent brought a motion for interim spousal support of $500 per month. The applicant brought a similar motion in October 2012. The latter was struck by the Local Registrar. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; Few would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment. The policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. She also claimed that he touched her breasts and vaginal and anal during the daytime. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that the acts took place primarily at her home, usually on Friday nights when her mother was working and her sister had gone to visit her brother and his girlfriend. The trial judge found that the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. He ruled that the evidence of a social worker was admissible, as it related to a period outside the time frame covered by the information, because it would go to the credibility of the complainant. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in allowing such evidence and as treating it as relevant to the complainant\'s credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to warrant a quashing of the conviction."

The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000.

The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986. Both parties were medical practitioners and each enjoyed significant income. HELD: 1)The applicant was to be responsible for approximately 2/3 of the monthly expenses.  2)The significant income enjoyed by the applicant was a factor to be taken into consideration when determining amount ofmaintenance to be Paid by the Respondent, particularly when I'm prepared to recognize a significant portion of the applicant's claim for extra-ordinary expenses. 3)The child support application was adjourned until May 1997 for any monies made out to the parties.  4)The father was to pay $150,000 to cover nanny and child care expenses. 5)The claim for recreation and a university fund was justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines. 6)The respondent was to contribute to the monies paid out by the parties since 1997."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an aboriginal right for commercial purposes. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed on the basis that the Court erred when it concluded that the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for food only. The defence argued that commercial fishing was not an issue at trial and that the Crown should make an issue of it on its own. As the respondents were Metis, they supported their Aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 based on the standard defence that they had used and found he would have convicted them on count 9 but for the constitutional defence which he had found to be established. The acquittal of the accused on counts 10 and 11 was granted as well as intervener status on the same grounds as the action in the first two grounds of appeal."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of certain statements made to a member of the Regina City Police Force. At issue was whether or not the highway traffic act obligation to give a report to the police renders any statement made during the report involuntary. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court was ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)Had there been a voir de dire, a different conclusion was reached (and possibly a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voir net in order to establish the Charter argument's foundation, the appeal would have been ordered. 3)Had all the Charter matters been properly raise and arguedbefore the learned judge, then a conclusion a different from that reached (by solely on the application) would have resulted, as one based solely upon common law concepts of voluntariiness and not on the imposition of a criminal charge."

He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan.

The defendant objected the defendant had not treated it fairly in awarding the contract to Nielsen Ashdown. The Plaintiff sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist. The person who invites tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally. The privilege clause entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of the tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get the contract. In every case, the person inviting the tenders who had the task of investigating the planes the tendered proposed to use, conducted the investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice. 2)Curniski conducted his investigation fairly.

The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'.

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

There were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she wasn't ready to have the matter rescheduled. Otherwise she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. She was not reluctant to make further applications. 2) There is no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused any delays. The weather caused delay of approximately two months.

The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The former wife applied to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of their separation agreement. Application allowed; the monthly amount of child support was increased; the former wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of support. The amount of support payable was to be varied based on the former husband's increased income and a decline in her income; the court was not prepared to retroactively vary the support terms. The Corollaries Relief Judgment was approved by the court and was not appealed. The court applied based on changes in circumstances since the granting of the last order. Changes in the income of the parties since the change in the date of the order were no reason to reduce the support. There was no evidence of undue hardship on the part of the former spouse as she spent time with the children and did not require the court to look at her finances."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.",The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The applicants have been unsuccessful in this application. The court found enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave to appeal. The issue of urgency is the time between resolution of the action and the appeal. It is not in the interest of justice to strike the action for delay.
8_2011skpc3.txt,"The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the blood alcohol concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. 1)Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b)to be informed of that right; and (c)to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful. 2)Everyone else has a right to choose one’s own counsel. The accused was in the custody of the police and he cannot exercise this right unless the police provide him with a reasonable opportunity to do so. The officer had not specifically asked the accused if he was satisfied with the consultation with Legal Aid, as that would normally be the duty of the officer. 3)The self-incriminating evidence against the accused was excluded."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the penitentiary and have been here for their entire lives. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the prison service within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the RCMP declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by the applicants is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. 3) The court has declined its jurisdiction to issue a remedy on the application guised as a habas corpus application. The Court has established that this is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of the prison."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. She now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The Court is of the view that the connection between the silicone implants and her condition was caused by negligence attributed to the defendants. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs of the application in any event of the cause."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision. HELD: The death benefit was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the respondent the death benefits payable to her as a surviving spouse and for the two children in accordance with the directions of the Court of Queen's Bench. 1)The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $603.25 per week for 14 days. 2)The interpretation suggested by SGI is appropriate when calculating the benefit for dependent children was that of an income replacement benefit. The deceased's gross yearly employment income is $51,343. That is the amount SGI calculated for the deceased's net loss. The death benefits are one-half the income replacement benefits referred to in Division 5 of the Act. The meaning of this term is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis."
9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The accused had been drinking alcohol and was in the wrong lane when he hit a pedestrian. He was given a conditional sentence of imprisonment in the amount of two years less a day. After pleading guilty, the accused argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range was one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be served in the community. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment for 90 days. 1)The Court of Appeal had reviewed the relevant case law and found it appropriate to sentence the accused to a sentence of 2 years less day. 2)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and appeared to be in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his consumption of alcohol appeared to contribute to the fatality or contributing factor. 3)The evidence suggested that the accused sped up to keep up with the other vehicle and hit the brakes. He should have had the benefit of electronic monitoring as part of his sentence."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the 'Action'), pending the petitioner's application or further court order;(b)restricts the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in connection to the Action; and(d)restrorbs the respondent of disposing all of the funds received by the respondent if any amount, whether by judgment or settlement, becomes payable to him pursuant to the action.HELD: The respondent's application was allowed. The respondent was directed to have the exparte order set aside.  1)The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action was the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the Act that was made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. 2)The ex partee order was lifted as against the Attorney-General of Canada."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with. The Crown relied on the presumption afforded by s.258 of the Code, the rebuttal evidence led by the appellant failed to rebut the same. That evidence consisted of the testimony of his three friends whose evidence related to the appellant having abstained from consuming alcoholic beverages in their presence and not to whether he had care andcontrol of his vehicle during time frame No. 1. 2)At issue was whether the trial judge erred by drawing the inference regarding time frame 2. The appellant argued that the conviction must be set aside in the absence of evidence proving the coexistence of impairment and care and care by alcohol. 3)The inference was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants ask that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. They also seek an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs. Much of the defendants’ client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence and the defendants could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that confidence.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the plaintiffs had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This venture requires secrecy. Disclosure would jeopardise the defendants ability to prove they are not breaching that agreement and their contract of employment.  2) There is no evidence of a breach of the plaintiff’s duty to disclose financial information. The disclosure sought by the plaintiff would not harm the defendants. The Court found that this was not the case of alleging one of the traditional classes of fiduciary, such as trustee and cestui que trust or solicitor and client, but rather one which was based on the specific facts proven in the case. The Act was not intended to preclude the disclosure of important information but rather to promote settlement between the parties.  3) The defendants were granted their application pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1), the Queen”s Bench Rules and the Court’S inherent jurisdiction for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages.  4) The application was dismissed with costs."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: 1) The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. 2) The applicant is prepared to make an offer but does not appear to have done so. There is limited evidence with respect to the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with listing the property as to the steps taken. The amount owing under the mortgage was described as being the arrears of principal, $29,994.98 and interest arreaars of $995.03 or total of $30,990.01.

When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008. The Crown had sought admission of the accused's statements made during the course of his detention, first on s. 87 Liquor Control Act violation for public drunkenness and then on the more serious charges as he became almost immediately the suspect in the assault on the complainant as they were known to be heavy drinkers who shared the porch. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and his Right to Counsel by making free telephone calls. He was asked if he understood his rights and his muttered reply created enough uncertainty for the court to call the police officer. The police officer testified that he did not intend to be cooperative witness and so he repeated the caution one line at time and asked after each sentence, 'Do you understand?' The accused did not understand the difference between a verbal warning and a written warning. He must have been aware that the police were required to be alert and aware of the danger he posed to other street people. The officer did not act in bad faith. The court reviewed the video statement now three times and replayed the portion of the tape where the accused referenced John Black. The defence submits that the accused chose not to avail himself of immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of John Black when he went to Court. The entire case rests on three statements made by the accused. The first is a reiteration of his Charter right to counsel, the second is a clarification of the s. 10(b) right to make a statement to the police and the third statement is an elaboration of the second statement. The second statement is a variation of the first statement made voluntarily and the accused must have understood that the officer was required to provide a clarification to the accused as to his choice of words. The Court held that it would be egregious to allow admission of this videotaped statement into evidence."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should been convicted of one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, is in agreement that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. In this case, the court concluded that the accused intentionally hit the complainant in the facial area with a candle holder. There is circumstantial evidence that she broke the window. However, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused is guilty of aggravated assault on a charge of assault causing bodily harm."

The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) of Criminal Code that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and control of the vehicle. The only thing the accused added to his viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This does not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. 2) The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent referred to in the disposition. 1)The judge's award of $110,000 was based on 20.4 months of future earnings. If the severance pay is additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to an extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship, then it should not be shareABLE. 2)The severance packages he received was not a reward of past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. 3)The Court found no basis upon which to change the disposition except to allow the appeal to proceed."

Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant appealed a jury trial decision awarding damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The trial judge had limited the amount of expert opinion evidence available to the jury as a result of the plaintiff's injuries.

The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The evidence of the past loss of income was so extensive as to be perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 2)The trial judge's finding of the future loss in income capacity was so inordinately high that it was perverse, entirely out of proportion, and unsupported by evidence. 3)The plaintiff was not seeking to avoid the presentation of argument through the mouth of this witness and relied on the evidence of an expert forensic accountant."

The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to follow company policy with respect to breaks and overtime.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the costs of the litigation should be fixed at the date of the award. HELD: 1) The Executions Act states that every judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of five percent per annum from the time of entering judgment until the judgment is satisfied. 2) The applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth. The only reasonable outcome was that the judgment in that particular required amendment. The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs were to be paid out of award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This was not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. 3) The respondent was ordered to pay $200,000 in lump sum."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits were to be payable pursuant to s.146(5). The deceased's children were entitled to receive any benefits payable under the Act. JUDGMENT: Section 147 of the Act does not assist the surviving spouse. It merely provides that where there is no surviving spouse or where the deceased was, as is the case here, sole parent, and there is more than one dependant, the surviving spouses death benefit under s146(1) is payable for the youngest child and the remaining children become entitled to the additional benefit which is payable under either s.145(5), or s.147(5); where, however, no benefit other than the minimum death benefit is payable, no further amount is payable."

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's race card and featured a field of eight horses.

HELD: The application was allowed. The matter was remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices were given to the applicants. 1)The applicants are the owners and the costs of their application are denied. 2)The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.

The blood alcohol reading at the time of the blood sample was 47 milligrams of ethanol per 100 millilitres of blood.  1)The Court noted that the testimony of the first witness was of a nurse who had not taken any particular notice of the white vehicle; it had not been weaving on the roadway nor had it been driven erratically. The road had been clear and clear. It was possible that she had not noticed the accused vehicle when she was driving. 2)The accused was found to have been operating a motor vehicle for approximately 3 hours prior to the accident.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was 3 years old when her mother died. The third child (R.M.) was born approximately 15 months later. The Agency found that N.D. was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining the children. They separated again in 2001. This time, the Agency provided more financial assistance to the mother. In relation to the third child, who was now 12 years of age, there was a consensus that the finding be entered under 22(2)(b) pursuant to s40(3) and that finding was made with respect to the Respondent, Nd. On the basis of the risk to the children caused by the failure of the parent to supervise adequately. The evidence was that the mother was prone to emotional distress and had been prone to grabbing her mother by the throat. She suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

HELD: The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender’s Act had been reviewed and the Youth Criminal Justice Act judge was not a Youth Justice Court judge for an offence as set out in s.469 of the Criminal Code. The Youth Criminal justice Act provides the following on interim detention for charge of murder: an application to this court under s.515 of the Code, s.515 of the code, s33 (8) and 13(2) for interim detention in custody of the accused pending his preliminary inquiry. The issue then becomes for a young person charged with an offence set out by s. 522 of the criminal code what is the definition of a Youth Court Judge? Section 13(3) of the Act provides that a judge shall be judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction in the province in which the election is made and no other court, judge or justice, may release the young person from custody under that section. There was no similar provision in the Young Offenders Act."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which the IRB is derived. 2) The legislation strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than half the time.

b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. The primary residence was with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support but sought authorization to obtain passports. The father was to pay child support of $986 per month. Joint custody awarded to the mother with access to the children every second weekend. The matrimonial home was clearly a matrimony asset and must be divided equally. The parents had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonium home with their mother. Although the mother's income had declined over the past few years, the children had been enjoying a reasonably good standard of living and would be able to participate in Sunday School, Mass and lunch with their extended family. The evidence showed that the mother had received significant financial support from the father. Although she did not have any direct involvement with the family business, she was given clear direction as to the appropriate amount of support to be paid."

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2)(a vehicle registered or required to be registered) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATIV on the road. The accused was also charged with operating an uninsured motor vehicle (AATV), speeding and being liable for damages arising in the event of an accident. The use of an ATVs on public highways is clearly prohibited under the Motor vehicle Act. There is no nexus between his driving of the ATVs and the revocation of his driver's licence. The offence of driving on a highway while driving a motor vehicle was clearly prohibited. The words are used within the words of the motor vehicle to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. When the content, context and purpose of section 287(3) is considered find that the legislature intended for that subsection to prohibit the USE of motor vehicles on the highways by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended, cancelled, or revoked. Before one can be guilty of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type or class for which they could properly have beenlicensed to drive a vehicle under s. 11 there is no license that can be issued to drive one on the roadway.

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the daughters were no longer children of the marriage, and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for a finding that the daughter was in arrears of maintenance, and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education. The daughter's father, who was an airline pilot, moved to Hong Kong where he resided with his new wife while the daughters lived with his mother. Pursuant to an inter-spousal agreement, the father was to pay child support in the amount of $450 per month for each child and among other things, he would maintain a scholarship fund for the daughters until they were 18. The mother failed to make any further efforts to contact the father. The trial judge found that this was not a situation where a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters was necessary and it was not reasonable to require the father to pay more. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in his finding the father is not in deficit of child support and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the issue. The case law indicates that the threshold is high for finding that a child's termination of a relationship with the parent is determinative of the child's status and entitlement to maintenance. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdraw by the daughter, the high threshold for a determination that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

The Crown appealed and the appeal was dismissed. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The court found that the appellant’s argument could not succeed because of the lack of a reasonable apprehension of bias.

b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The Court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The plaintiff had been the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) for 5 years and had been appointed director in 2002. The following year he was appointed director of a full-service animal hospital (VHT) full-time clinic, serving approximately 12,000 members of the public each year. The VTH also served as the teaching and research facility for veterinarian students enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan. As director, the hospital administrator was also an active participant in the harassment against the plaintiff, which the Court found was an intentional violation of the plaintiff's duty to protect his reputation. The Court accepted the defence ofqualified privilege by the defendants. The court found that the plaintiff was not only defamed but had been a contributing participant to the harassment himself. The cause of action was intentional interference by the employer in failing to prevent the harassment, which constituted intentional intentional interference. Jurisdiction over the conduct of the employees constituted a serious infringement of the rights of the accused."

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"Civil Procedure – Custody and Access – Affidavits – AdmissibilityCivil Procedure - Affidavit – Admitting AdmissibleSome issues arose as a result of the respondent’s proposal to the court. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal.

The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applied for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: The respondent was found to have paid $55,120 per month for the past 10 years. He now applied to have the support obligation reduced to reflect a lower income than that imputed in the original order. He sought to have his support obligation recast according to what an appropriate, imputed income might be rather than that which was imputed to him in the interim order.  1) The Court found that the respondent had failed in his onus for the years 2005 through to, and including, 2012. The respondent has failed to establish that his mental health problems prevented him from earning the income he earned in 2005. The Court ordered that child support should be calculated from January 1, 2013 ongoing based on the actual incomes. 2) The court recognized the onus on the respondent to justify the need for change. He had been in arrear from the time the order was granted and had avoided paying anything for the entire time. There was nothing to indicate he would not continue to earn the present level of income on into the future. 3) The respondent had paid little towards either the court order or his obligation in the past. He suffered from mental health difficulties in the form of depression. He did little other than live at his parents' home. There is nothing to suggest he will not continue in the work force in the future, but the Court found he had not been able to find employment in his chosen field, or otherwise to continue earning an income. It was concluded that the depression had adversely affected his ability to work and that he should seek professional help to improve his health.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the Minister) is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The Cape's request is based on the submission that the province is statutorily mandated to provide free of cost the buildings required to deliver the basic public school program. The applicant board submits there is an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver school buildings the delivery the basic school program, to lease buildings from a third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. The Church is not a party to the lease. The Province is not required to pay the cost of these leases.

The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","Decision in mortgage loss suit. The plaintiff had purchased two insurance policies for the purpose of indemnifying her against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The defendant failed to disclose the policy to the plaintiff and the insurer of the property. When the property was totally destroyed by fire in 1992, the plaintiff, who had been advised of the possible loss, refused to foreclose. She sought solicitor to act on her behalf. Awarding the plaintiff $200,000 for the loss of the other insurance policy, that under the terms of the arrangement the plaintiff should not be denied coverage on the basis of errors made by the insurer, the standard of proof was still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court accepted the plaintiff's submission that the insurance policies were in place for the protection of the plaintiff company and that they had been 'underwritten by and for the insured by' by the defendant."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during the construction of a sewage treatment lagoon. The defendant had hired the plaintiff's insurance agent to do the work and had entered into a contract with the plaintiff to do Phase 3 of the project. When the project was completed, a sewage system lagoon was constructed along side the plaintiff property. After completing the project, a mud slide occurred causing extensive damage to her property. She sought and was awarded her 'throw away' costs of obtaining the default judgment. Awarding the default, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing it. The applicant should have taken the matter to court to seek default judgment, and found that the Prothonotary had no authority to sign the default judgement. Even if am wrong on that issue, finding the position of the defendant meets the test for strike under the provisions of Rule 12.06. The application was granted. The defendants Town was given 10 days in which to file its defence. The default judgment was set aside."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant, who had been convicted of theft, applied for leave to appeal. Appeal allowed; sentence of 5 months incarceration to be followed by 18 months probation with an emphasis on rehabilitation. The appellant had not consumed drugs or alcohol while residing with him and had not had any problems with his use of drugs since his release on bail. The evidence showed that he had not been in the company other offenders since residing with them. The Court found that the appellant's evidence in regard to his alcohol and drug use had been unreliable and misleading. The negative information contained in the pre-sentence report, not available to the appellant until the morning of the sentence hearing, played a significant part in the disposition reached by the sentencing judge."
c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal; if so, what period of notice was appropriate. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages.  1)It was impossible to quantify the time that she had spent on maternity leave but it was clear from the outset that these changes were fundamental to the employment contract and that the plaintiff was constructually dismissed by the defendant, who had failed to take proper notice. 2)It is not always straightforward to calculate the time period for a claim, but the plaintiff has clearly made it known that she is entitled to damages. 3)It seems to me that the most appropriate period of warning is 8 months. This is not the time to make inferences as to the amount of remuneration, but rather to consider the period of time between the employment notice and the dismissal notice. There was no evidence that the defendant's intention was not made clear to the plaintiff prior to the letter. 4)The plaintiff has explored all possibilities for potential employment and has simply not been successful at any rat of pay. She has turned down no positions because she has not had the option of doing so. She simply has not been offered any positions. Considering all of the circumstances, it is concluded that an appropriate and proper notice is eight months. 5)Costs were awarded in the amount from July 14 to July 14."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 26(2)(b). The defendant offered a different requirement for the exercise of the right of refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. The offer did not require that it be forwarded a letter of commitment directly from a recognized financial institution. It simply required that the plaintiffs 'provide' such a letter. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. 2) The amount of mortgage financing available was reduced from $480,000 to $629,000 as the defendant accepted a written offer from a third party to purchase 14 quarter sections of the plaintiffs' previously surrendered land for a price of $630,280. 3) The plaintiffs had complied with their original contractual obligation to provide a 'letter of commitment' to the defendant by the date of the offer and had incurred liabilities with the defendant on the usualtrust conditions. 4) The loan approval issued by Farm Credit Corporation is not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment to finance the purchase of the farm land. 5) The Court found that the plaintiff had not exercised its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation by offering a different condition for the exercise of the first refusal in the offer enclosedwith the cover letters. In the offer form, it did not ask that the defendant provide a specific amount of money but simply required it to provide within 15 days either an unconditional or unequivocal letter."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The Law Society of Saskatchewan in response to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in MacDonald Estate v. Martin found that there was a strong inference that lawyers who work together share confidences. The law firm had put in place many of the screening measures suggested by the Guidelines in the Code. The lawyer swore an affidavit in this application that she has not had any conversations with anyone associated with the former client's files and that she will not discuss those files with anyone within the firm. HELD: The law office met the legal test enunciated by Mr. Sopinka. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of all the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information had occurred or would occur. The court found that the screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case and there was not a risk of real mischief. There were numerous independently verifiable steps which the lawyer had taken to ensure that no disclosure would occur by her. The instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to. The applicant was found to have received confidential information from both clients."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta. Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court. She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial.","The applicant sought an order against the third party, requiring it to pay $55,000 into court. The third party opposed the application for leave to move to Medicine Hat, arguing that the move would be tantamount to a denial of access. HELD: The applicant was directed to grant leave to the applicant to remove the children from Medicine Hat and to arrange for trial. The status quo as to access should also be maintained, as the respondent had designed the primary residence with the children to be with the applicant and the applicant was granted access every second weekend. The applicant secured an excellent job in Medicine Hat (60 miles from the matrimonial home) and the eldest child could attend kindergarten there. The respondent opposed the applicant's request for leave and requested that the children be moved to Medicine hat. The court granted leave to leave the applicant with the child to move; their primary residence will thereby continue; the status quo in access should remain the same as before: access to the respondent was granted every third weekend, to enable the parties to attend family ski vacation and, on such occasion, the applicant will pick up and return the children. Costs of the move were directed to be paid by the applicant. The property was reserved by the court for the purpose of trial and the court ordered that all proceeds from the sale of the property be reserved to the court. In addition, all costs of the mortgage, rent and sale were to be reserved at the respondent's expense."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read the notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing his arguments. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The Court was unanimous in our opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentencing must be dismissed. Your state of mind at the time you made the telephone calls which were the subject of the charges somehow exonerated you from responsibility for them. This defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. Since the appeal against the sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial, it is now moot: that is, there is no issue to be decided. 2) The appeals against both a conviction and a sentence are dismissed."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The medical resident pursuing certification as a specialist in orthopaedic surgery appealed both his suspension and probation as medical resident rescinded and a prohibition of the investigation committee established to look into the matter from taking further action. An appeal committee was struck pursuant to the provisions of the College of Medicine, Regulations for Dealing with Unsatisfactory Evaluations and Disciplinary Action Part (RTCA) regulations. The appellant's union (PAIRS) brought an application for an order prohibiting the committee from proceeding further and ordering the appellant reinstated as resident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.  There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs of grace and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention. There were other avenues of appeal available, however the appellant's application was premature."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property pursuant to the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a tractor from his uncle and sold it to the petitioner for $2,200. The petitioner had no income from the farm since the separation. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years he has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The father stated that he had no interest in any equipment owned by the respondent. 2) The respondent sold his trailer and the proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the farm. 3) The debts submitted by the father were statute-barred and they were fixed at $800. 4) The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action.  5) The amount of interest earned would not be taken into account as the respondent owned a line of machinery of significant value.  6) Although the respondent gave conflicting evidence, he testified that he owned the tractor. He testified that it was acquired prior to the marriage and that he owed the father $16,500. The Court did not take into account the father's ownership of the tractor, as he was the sole owner. 7) The Court considered the RRSP registered in the name of the respondent and the amount of the proceeds from the sale of the farm machinery. The amounts set out do indicate that the respondent owns a Line of Automobiles of significant Value. 8) In the circumstances the respondent shall have three months in which to pay the judgment and, in the event payment is not made, the petitioner may apply to this court for directions as to sale of family home including the family home. 9) The appellant shall have 3 months to pay judgment. 10) The court weighed the oral testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, while also considering the content of large number of documents. The majority of documents were referred to three appraisals; one which was done at the behest of the petitioner and two for the respondent, and they all took the average value. 11) The oldest son owned a Case 800 tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill which were purchased as part of the marriage (exhibits D-21 and D-23).  12) The father owned a tractor and 1 mill which was purchased"
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages. 2)The employer obeyed its contractual obligation to hold a hearing to conclude all outstanding terms of the first contract. The hearing was held in April 2000. It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. 3)The issue then becomes patently unreasonable. To be unreasonable it must be clearly irrational, absurd, ridiculous so beyond the bounds of reason as to amount to a fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it. 4)At no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board as noted by the union was patently irrational. 5)The respondent had obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April of 2000 which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible.  6)The motion was also dismissed. It did not meet the standard of patently unreasonably unreasonable as defined by the Courts."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the Canadian Armed Forces between 1951 and 1972 and who was discharged in March of 1972. The plaintiffs claim entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' pursuant to legislation enacted July 31, 2000. The claim for damages arising from silicone breast implants designed, manufactured and marketed by the defendants. The plaintiff alleged that she suffered damages arising out of silicone breast implant designed, manufacture and sold by them. She had the implants inserted in 1975. By 1976 she was suffering tenderness, hardening of the breasts, inflammation, fatigue, numbness, cysts, headaches, swelling in her fingers and arthritis. The statement of claims was issued in 1993. In both tort and contract, the limitation period in Ontario is 6 years. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. All the elements necessary for a cause of action such as this to succeed including the plaintiff’s allegation that she was not properly informed of her right to apply for the benefit were found to be individual to the class members. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute-barred. 1) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual. The Court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court.  2) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England. If there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. The issue at the certification stage is not whether the claim is likely to succeed, but whether the suit is appropriately prosecuted as a class action. The issues at the trial stage are some of the common and some of others that are individual."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000 from it. The next day, he withdrew $20,000 in cash from the account and deposited it into his bank account, depositing it in the CIBC Bank account and withdrawing the $24,000. The bank reported the fraud to the Provincial Court, giving the accused a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. The Crown appealed the conditional discharge. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and a 12 month conditional sentence was substituted in place of the 1 year conditional sentence. The accused was fined $24000 and had to perform 200 hours community service. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code, which require that the accused perform 150 hours ofcommunity service work in order to have the probation order lifted. The conditional discharge was not appropriate as he had no criminal record and had no previous involvement with the criminal justice system. He was a low risk to re-offend. The offence was significant and should attract a criminal record. The sentence imposed did not reflect the gravity of the offence. A conditional discharge would do little to discourage others from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 charge and, in his decision, the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and either an acquittal or a new trial ordered by virtue of alleged errors in law.  1) Absent expert testimony interpreting a particular reading, court cannot use the reading to come to a conclusion as to what quantity of alcohol was consumed or what effect, vis-à-vis impairment, such consumption of alcohol had on the particular accused. 2) The Court was cognizant of the fact that the accused's driving behaviour was attributable to his hurt ankle and was not as result of any impairment from the considerable alcohol that he had, he had drank. The only foundation for the conclusion that impairment was a result of his impairment was the references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit.' The conditional stay was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had made an application for ongoing child maintenance based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay the sum of $90 per month as child maintenance and to be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date. The Guideline amount was the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study."
c_2006nssc132.txt,"When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord. Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. The Trustee was appointed as trustee and the Trustee retained Allan Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors. When he attended the premises, he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. The Court found that it was clear that the landlord lost its distress rights on the bankruptcy of the tenant. The landlord was only intended to be a guarantor and the lease prepared by County Realty Ltd. showed that he was only acting as guarantor. It did not state how much the plaintiff was paying on the lease, nor did it say how much it would cost.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence, claiming damages for the injuries suffered by two of the plaintiffs. Both the plaintiffs and the defendant signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the 1998 motor vehicle accident. The third plaintiff, the other plaintiff, filed a Statement of Claim. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs. HELD: Both conditions were satisfied. The defendant should be entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who have already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process. The motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both the plaintiffs were dismissed. 1)There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. The plaintiff had passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim had a real chance of success. They had failed to do so. 2)Both conditions are satisfied. Both defendants were granted judgment for the plaintiff, dismiss the proceeding, allow claim, dismiss claim, or dismiss defence and the parties were permitted to file written submissions."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss.253(1) and 253(2)(b). The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel. The removal of the cell phone from the police cruiser does give pause for thought in that the accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it is clear from the evidence that the made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. 1)The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused’s rights under s.10(b). 2)There was no evidence of interference by the RCMP. The destruction of the video evidence could have been considered in the court of law. 3)The accused had a duty to act with the same diligence as the accused would have done if attempting to contact a lawyer by phone. The officer(s) should have provided a “Prosper” warning to the accused before proceeding to take samples of breath.  4)The evidence was destroyed. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult another lawyer. Accordingly, the officer was justified in assuming he was satisfied. 5)The absence of any evidence of legal advice obtained by the accused (other than his phone book) could have had an effect on the accused. An independent investigation was conducted to determine whether there was any breach of his rights."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a blocked receiving pit. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in the pit. Viterra is charged with three counts under the Canada Labour Code. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal does not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the employee exercised due care and diligence."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The defence argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her towards the side of the road and assaulted her. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness and refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not err in not applying the de minimis non curat lex principle to the offence. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the decision made by the trial court. The court was satisfied that the judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested she did not take a zero tolerance approach to domestic violence. The Court was not entitled to substitute my own opinion for that of the trial trial judge."

For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; in dealing with maintenance under the Divorce Act; alternatively, the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconscionable and harsh to bind the wife to such a arrangement. Awarding the wife $65,000 for matrimonial purposes, that in order to have the agreement continue, the court must also consider the fact that the wife was given financial assistance throughout her marriage, including from the husband. This does not relieve the wife of any obligation to pay child support but, in the absence of such assistance, it does raise an issue of moral and ethical conduct."

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention.

d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the RTM. 2)The plaintiff cannot accept the plaintiff's allegation that there was a common agreement or intention and mistake in the wording of the agreement.

d_1997canlii11230.txt,"The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied. Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","Paterson Sons appealed an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, agreed on an arbitrator, and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him. The award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent. The only issue which the Court could not resolve was whether the arbitrator 'applied the correct measure of damage' as one of law. The second ground of appeal was whether there was any evidence to support the finding of fact.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The sole beneficiary was the estate. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for the elder son until he attains the age of twenty-one years. The codictil directed the executors to rent the farm land with the deceased's brother having the first option to lease. There were gifts over to the mother and to the brother in the event that the deceased dies before attaining the age at which age the children will be entitled to receive a quarter of a million dollars. The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. HELD: The maintenance was reduced from $150 per child per child to $1,245 per month. The Estate was in good standing to liquidate the farm machinery, livestock and other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. A further reduction of 17% was made in the amount of $900 which was sufficient to permit the maintenance to continue until the children reached the age where they would be required to lease vehicles. A more generous award may result. The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery or equipment or other assets which related to or support the family's business andoperations."

HELD: A conditional order was ordered requiring the bankrupt to pay $18,000.00 for distribution to the unsecrated creditors. 1)The trustee calculated surplus income of $435.00 per month and recommended a conditional order requiring the payment be made by monthly installments of $350.00. 2)The bankrupt had a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligation which stretched back at least 15 years. Not only did the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also did not file his returns. The only issue at the discharge hearing was the determination of the amount of surplus income available to pay. Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. 3)A conditional order would be made available to all creditors. 4)Costs of $400 were payable out of the estate."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. She appealed her conviction and raised numerous grounds of appeal. The appellant was fined $250.00 and had to appear in the Baddeck Hospital for a complete stop. On the appeal of her conviction, the appellant took the position that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. Appeal dismissed; the evidence was found to be so unreliable as to be unreasonable."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. Appeal allowed; the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA. The sentence continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. The court found that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had just expired. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the legislation is the same as that in R. v. Zundel (1992), [1998] S.C.R. 45 at para. 33. 2) Section 107(1) of the Act provides for an order for apprehension and review by the provincial director. It also provides that, until a young person is apprehended, he or she is deemed not to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the youth person is then serving. There is no reference to suspension in s. 102(1). Section 102(2) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s. 107 merely as an aid to the reader. In other words, the youth justice court judge seems to have thought s.102(2)(a) incorporates only the 'apprehend' aspect of s.107 because that is all it refers to. The Court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the youth court judge had erred."

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions of the Board's case management division and appeals committee. HELD: The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. 1) Certiorari remains a writ of grace to grant or withhold as, in the discretion of the court, circumstances suggest. The Board began to develop the view that the applicant might be fit for employment after all. The decision of the medical review panel was contrary to s. 64(2) of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. 2) The appeal to the court is determined on the issue of jurisdiction. 3) The Court reviewed the evidence and found the decisions to be contrary to ss. 22(2), 23(3) and 34(1). 4) The appellant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. Whether or not each of the impugned decisions was made without jurisdiction and consequently is a nullity, the applicant had an adequate remedy available. It is not necessary for the Court to decide on the issues of jurisdiction or jurisdiction in this case. In the case of the appellant, the issues are the availability of relief and the issues to which an appeal can be appealed.

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred as a result of the defendant's negligence in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle. The plaintiffs claimed that the accident occurred because of the defendants' failure to operate their headlights when they approached the intersection. The defendant testified that he had had six or seven beers that evening and that the plaintiff had had two White Russians during the course of the day. At issue was whether the plaintiff's headlights were in operation when they were struck by the police vehicle. HELD: The plaintiff was found liable for $824,872 in damages. 1) The evidence of the accident reconstructionist convinced the Court that the defendant was negligent in failing to notice the plaintiff vehicle when he turned his vehicle right in front of it. The Court could not accept the testimony of the witness who said she was about half-a-mile away from the accident scene. 2) The defendant was found to be contributory to the damage to the plaintiffs' relationship and the Court was awarded judgment for damages to the defendants. 3) The Court was unable to recover the damages from the defendant."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been considered a prior warrant issued that day. The applicant claimed the employment records contained incomplete and misleading information and that the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the issuance the search warrant. The application sought the return of the documents alleging that the documents had been found at the applicant's place of business, located in his and Ms. Taylor's residence, and in any storage facilities occupied by the applicant. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant did not say that he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he was more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the Court was satisfied that the respondent's own evidence supports the inference that he Would not have pursued a warrant without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. Unless real bias can be shown, such prior contact is not sufficient to raise an appearance of bias.  2)The nature of the breach of the rules of natural justice is complex and there are a number of factors that can raise the level of suspicion, conjecture, hypothesis or 'fishing expedition' to the same degree as the search warrants. The search warrant was based on an information to obtain (information to obtain) sworn by a lawyer. A search warrant issued pursuant to s.485(1)(a) requires the disclosure of information that is relevant to the purpose of the search. 3)A search warrant is not automatically justified. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the Applicant that did not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll. The Court cannot conclude that they rise above the level that'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant. 4)The application was allowed with costs. The costs were set-off. 5)Costs were assessed in the amount of $108,000. In addition, costs were assessed under the Divorce Act and under the Matrimonial Property Act"
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having care and control of the vehicle contrary to ss.253(b) and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood contrary to the Criminal code. The accused testified that he was in the passenger seat and crossed to the driver's seat of an idling vehicle to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence.  1)The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)The only issue and the one on which requested briefs from the Crown and Defence was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time.  3)There was little, if any, danger of the car being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the public."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The children were to be returned to the father directly but the father proposed that he would continue living with the mother and take anger management courses while he first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the mother had been on methadone for most of her life and that the father had indicated that he was considering returning the children to him. The father had a substantial criminal record, which included 16 offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were primarily property crimes, especially vehicles and failures to comply with the dispositions made with regard to his offences. The youth had been in the care of the Ministry since the birth of the children and there had been some neglect and abuse by the father. H.H. was the mother who supported the father who asked that the children be returned in his care. The mother who opposed the father's proposal to have the children returned to him had a lengthy history of substance use and had spent time in the hospital and it had been clear from the evidence that the parents had not been able to find suitable housing and that most of the time the father was in hospital, it was difficult for the mother to contact the father because of her addiction and because the father would have to pay more attention to the children. Although the mother was a social worker, she had extensive experience dealing with the parents of children and she was intimately involved with their lives and had firsthand knowledge of the father’s drug use and his attempts to control it. The social worker had been involved with the family since the day the children were born and had been with the father for much of their lives. The parents had been estranged for many years and it was important to maintain their relationships with their children and to provide support to them so they would continue to live in safe, secure and appropriate care. Although both children were in care at the time of the birth, the father indicated that the relationship had been tumultuous and that he had not followed through with his programming. H H. was apprehended at the hospital. The issues between the father and the mother were complex and there were concerns about the father having access to alcohol and drugs and the children would be exposed to violence if he"
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs sought to compel the defendant to provide notice to them of the nine property owners who had, to date, received the package. The defendant motion was dismissed. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce a plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre-certification notice. The plaintiff cannot be a class member until class is certified which would in turn suggest that the section was not intended to operate until class existed. It is important to keep in mind that we are in the pre certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. An action is defined under s. 8 of the Class Action Act as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998' and Class Action is defined as an action certified as class action pursuant to Part II. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding that preliminary conflict objection. The purpose of the motion is to give the defendant an opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through'some lawful manner'. The Court will not be suspending the action in the interim."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. The mother was working and living in the trust unit with her father and was disabled. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in gainful employment during the year following the order of Ottenbreit J. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the mother on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student."

The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement in September 2010.

The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence.

d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIIRA compliance Order. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. The Court of Appeal disagrees with the sentencing decision. The Meaning of the Section is plain. offenders who committed multiple designated offence will be subjected to a lifelong SOIra compliance order which is mandatory in these circumstances. Sexual assault is a 'designated offence' under s 490.011(a) of The Code. Where an offender is convicted of a designated offence, s.500.012 (1) requires the sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple 'designation' convictions and the offender's criminal record discloses no prior convictions for 'designate offence' such that the judge declined to order the accused, who had been convicted of more than one such offence, to comply for life (s. 490)013(1). An order made under s.(2) 490.012 or (2) (b) ends 20 years after it was made if the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence is 10 or 14 years; and, in the case of this case, he is entitled to a 10-year firearm prohibition and a 10, DNA order in the definition of 'designating offence' in s.485.011. The meaning and clarity of s.(1) s.476.013 (2.0) is such that there is no need to make a statutory decision requiring an application directly after an offence has been established for a statutory verdict. The statutory decision establishes that a statutory judgment establishes that an offence is a designated one, and a statutory order has been made pursuant to that statute"
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed documents. During the trial, defence counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further time to allow the discovery of the documents and the disclosure of the other documents. In the intervening weeks, Crown counsel also received instructions to allow defence counsel to continue to review the documents, in the afternoon of Friday September 6, 2014, at approximately 5:00 p.m. (UTC). Defence counsel filed a letter of objection stating that to allow a conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge did not err in refusing to adjourn and the Crown sought leave to further cross-examine any of the witnesses. On the basis of the circumstantial evidence, the trial judge drew the conclusion that the accused was guilty of the charges against him. 1) The Court was in the position of the Crown counsel that it was not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available. 2) The Crown failed to establish a breach of s. 11(d) of the Charter. The Court is in the same position as the Crown Counsel in Anderson, 2013 SKCA 92 (CanLII), 300 CCC (3d) 296 [Anderson). The Court reviewed the case and found that the Crown was not able to demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. 3) There is no evidence of breach by the Crown of the disclosure. The disclosure of these documents was of significant importance to the defence in light of the fact the Crown disclosed the documents. It is common ground that an unknown quantity of documents listed in the Index had not been previously disclosed, including, among other things, the information pertaining to two upcoming witnesses. In this case, the Crown did not disclose the documents to defence counsel. In light of that finding, the Court found that a new trial is warranted. A review of the previously disclosed documents is the only appropriate remedy."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their 3-year-old son; and awarded child support to the appellant of $2,726 per month. The appellant appealed only portions of the interim order dealing with the enforcement of spousals support arrears created as a result of an interim order. He argued the amount in issue was the amount required by the order, that he should be credited to and including January 2016 for his payments with respect to the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities, and that there was a real possibility that the appellant would not be able to repay any 'overpayment' by the respondent. Application allowed; stay imposed until hearing of the appeal."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, and two other charges related to the Internet Child Exploitation Unit. The accused had been a member of the RCMP for 10 years and had been part of the ICE Unit since 2013. The ICE Unit investigated the accused's residence and found that the accused was accessing the same server, same Internet address, and obtained the same information from the same physical location. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex and the ICE unit conducted a search of its premises. During the course of the investigation, the Court was able to determine that every time there was activity on the CPS log with respect to his IP address, was time when he was not on duty. The Court was satisfied that the officer had a very good understanding of how computers work and that it was possible that both the accused and the child pornography user could have access to the same file. HELD: The Court held that the second and third file being flagged by CPS was the exact same file and that the third file, the G.U.I.D. number, was assigned to the accused by the officer as the physical address of the particular file and its contents were all encrypted. As the Court found that both of the accused’s computers were being monitored, it concluded that the same address was being used by the Shareaza file sharing program. The second file was assigned G. U.I.(I. D.) and the third was assigned as the serial number of the file. The court ordered that the information be entered by the registered address of each computer on that computer. The result of the search was that all of the information was being shared between the two computers. The residential area was searched and the residential unit was found to be the location of the most recent increase in child pornography activity. The third file was also found to have been accessed by the accused. The home address of one of the two individuals who had been arrested was at the address of another individual. The residence was occupied by a female child who resided in the residence with her spouse. Although she had indicated that her computer was non-password protected, she was unable to obtain the password from the accused because the Internet connection was not secure. The officer testified that he had personally reviewed the file sharing application Shareaza and that he was familiar with the software and its associated features. He also testified that the residential area had a large amount of Internet access and that"
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc. in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and associated Equipment. When required, it would provide shop supplies, parts, and services on a number of occasions. In June of 2016 it ceased to pay invoices as they became due. Eventually the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invoicing and the defendant denied it. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant, in the absence of an express term in a contract, would be $10,902.32. As it has been agreed between the parties that the sum of 8,614.17 was paid, there remains due and payable prejudgment interest of $2,288.15. 1) The plaintiff received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought. The defendant was successful in reducing the amount of money sought and asked that the court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a reasonable price. Although there was no evidence as to precisely when the contract commenced, the plaintiff was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once, but twice. The plaintiff is entitled to costs for both occasions.  2) The amount of travel and accommodation was completely in excess of the amount charged by the parties. The parties were in agreement that parts which would normally cost a significant amount would not be purchased by the defendant unless it had first discussed the matter with the plaintiff. This seems to be an implied term that the parties agreed to charge and pay a fair price for those parts. 3) There is no evidence of cost of travel. Expenses incurred on each and every occasion for which the plaintiff is required to attend at a rate of $.50 per hour. Expansions which would have been unreasonably high in the first place would not have been proportionate to the amount sought."

Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. Fossil was hired as a fund development officer by Tudex. The company incorporated as a result of a market study program which was terminated prematurely. The chief financial officer of the company made the known to the chief executive officer that there were identifiable investors in place. The marketing study was to take three months. During that time, the marketing study did not continue beyond June 2. That was when the contract stipulated that the investment capital should come from the Fund Development Officer. That agreement had failed. The Fund Development officer was retained by the company to survey the market in eastern Canada. That is when the market study was still in progress. The move by the Fund Director to purchase the shares was made. At the time of the market report, the Fund development officer was still employed by the TUDEX. In his counterclaim, Fossil sought rescission of the contract, alleging that the agreement was disallowed. HELD: Fossil's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)A mutual mistake existed. When there was a failure of a performance by the Fossil in an essential part of a contract, the defendant was entitled to repudiate it. The defendant was not required to testify. 2)The claim for $31,500 was rejected on the same ground that rescissions of the agreement relating to the market Study is disallowed on the evidence."
e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year. However, in 1990 the rent was raised from $500 to $515 per month. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The decision of the Residential Tenancies Board set aside the decision and the order of the trial judge. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order and order set aside, that the Board had erred in law in interpreting the residential Tenancies Act by concluding that a landlord cannot increase the rent during the term of the lease. The provisions of the Rent Review Act and the Standard Form of Lease are clear. The respondent could not unilaterally increase rent."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The clause in the agreement also stated that they would cohabit for more than 90 days and that this agreement would vitiate their agreement to live separate and apart. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the separation agreement was between the parties and that they had signed in 1996 and 1997. The respondent was evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. He questioned the nature of the agreement in light of the narrow issue presented to him. He also questioned the circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason for the grant of theit. He asked the question, 'When did the parties cohabitate?'. HELD:(1) The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The husband swore that they cohabited for 10 days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until September 18. The father disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitation extended from June 30 1997 until June 30. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the cohabitations would have extended for a period of at least 95 days.    1) The respondent evasive and argumentative. He was found to be in contemptuous of his own province. His decisions to apply for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings were regrettably short and he was fined $10,000. 2) The circumstances of the signing and the reasons for giving theit were complex and the respondent was deeply unrepentant in his questioning of the petitioner. 3) The law and order in this province does not permit self-regulating destruction of property. In this case, the law did not permit such destruction. 4) The facts did not change in the circumstances of this case.  5) The fact that the petitioner was the only person called at the trial did not result in a change in law.

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

Dismissing the appeal, that the Court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction should not be invoked to interfere in a proposal by a rival for creditors, when it appears the statutory process is being used for purposes not contemplated by Parliament. The Court found that the Registrar did not fail to appreciate the evidence nor err in arriving at the conclusion that the creditors had assigned their rights to the appellant. It would be wrong to allow the appellant to do in the proposal what the respondent had done in 1989, in which a competitor created an improper purpose in voting the creditors into bankruptcy.

The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. The Court found no evidence to support this. 2) The accused had not been drinking. He was in the truck when the accident occurred. The conversation was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges before trial. The accused's insistence that there were was another person in the cab of the truck who he said was driving was rejected. The evidence of the driver of the Sunfire and the accused's accused had been found to be unreliable. 3) There must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. There has been no breach of confidence in the Crown's ability to establish the identity of the operator of the vehicle. The conversations between the Crown and Defence witnesses were found to have been about the width of the boulevard in the intersection. The discussions between the two testifying police officers and the driver's vehicle driver did not affect the findings.

HELD: The respondent was ordered to provide a copy of the lease to the sheriff within fifteen days of its execution or any alternation in the lease or tenants to it. 1)The respondent failed to comply with all the requirements of the Order.  2)The Court found no reason why the respondent should not be required to provide written information to the court as to be too much of an interference and the manner of payment of rental should be subject to the contractual determination of the landlord and the tenant. 3)The court imposed a fine of $10,000 on the respondent. The fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution as the respondent had acted speedily and with diligence to do everything required of him. It was only reasonable that the respondent advise any and all tenants in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit.

It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The appellant filed a complaint under Part II of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code alleging that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. CUPE brought a claim against the appellant for breach of contract and breach of employment agreement. The appellant argued that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the city was responsible for the discrimination, as the appellant had not been properly accommodated for the considerable time that elapsed since the complaint took place. He also argued that there was a burden akin to a vicarious liability or fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the appellant's truck or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1) The appellant was awarded $8,902.00 as damages. 2) The tribunal was unable to find that the appellant was being discriminatory in the manner in which he was categorized and treated. The discrimination resulted in the appellant being awarded an amount of money less than other casual employees. 3) The court was not satisfied by the evidence. The City and CUPe were unable to provide the appellant with employment insurance due to his Cerebral Palsy. The decision of the tribunal was not accurate. It was clear that the issues before the court were determined by the tribunal and the facts before it. The tribunal failed to take into account the appellant’s disability."

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983 and he shall pay the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn, born December 1998 and in 2004 the sum of $568.00 per month. The father will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those arreaars to be paid monthly. See no reason why the overpayment by the payingor should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances. 2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital Cost allowance on personal property owned a partnership. The Court will deal with these issues on a year-by-year basis. 3) The Court was not prepared to add back any of the partnership amounts to the father automatically."

The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the chambers judge had not erred in his decision to require the appellant to pay proportionately to the extracurricular activities of the children in addition to the usual $2,532 for each child. The only issue on appeal was whether all, some, or none of the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines. The appellant’s position was that these expenses were not extraordinary within their meaning of the guidelines. The issue was whether the expenses exceeded what the appellant could reasonably cover taking into account her income and her contribution to health care and day care. The respondent argued that the judge should be required to consider the total income of the parties, including the respondent, and to have concluded that roughly half of this was “extraordinary” in the sense of s7(1.1). The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was no palpable and overriding error in law; the judge did not make a palpable or overriding error nor did he err in law in his interpretation of the evidence."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a deposit they gave to the defendant.

Awarding the defendant $176.22, that a just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The contract was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. Neither party could have foreseen this issue. The parties could not come to an agreement on how to remedy the frustrated contract. The Plaintiff's reasons for rejecting the installation of the concrete pad and pillar system, different foundation type and design, were reasonable in the circumstances.

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a) as of the Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The accused's Charter application was granted. The Court held that the accused had reasonable grounds pursuant to s254(3) to make the demand for breath samples and that the Certificate of Analysis should not be excluded. There was no breach of s.8 or s.9 of the Charter and the admission of the evidence would serve to enhance rather than detract from the public interest in the truth seeking function of the criminal trial process, particularly since the evidence in question is reliable and was obtained in a non-invasive manner. The only issue to be determined was whether the admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Based on the totality of the above evidence, the Court concluded that the officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid. It was well settled that there is a subjective and objective component to finding that reasonable grounds exist within the meaning of s254. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the charter by the officer and was at the lower end of the spectrum of breaches. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused. The officer did make observations indicative of impaired driving, but there is no objective evidence to conclude that the impairment of the ability to drive was the cause of the impairment. Therefore, the grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and the evidence thus obtained should be excluded pursuant to the s24(2)."

With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the children's benefit. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children’s provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of The Education Act and found that the CÉF had not complied with its commitments to the children. HELD: The Court held that the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the school and their failure to encourage the children to learn in French.  1) The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-right holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan. 2) The Court found that it was impossible for the Court to analyze the reasoning and facts of the law in light of the statements of claim made by the plaintiffs. 3) There was no evidence that the Court would be unable to find a satisfactory solution to the problems identified by the Court based on the evidence of the plaintiffs and their non-rights holder parents. 4) There were no reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that the discrimination against the plaintiffs was based entirely upon the failure of the parents to comply with their commitments. The court awarded special damages for out-of-pocket expenses, travel expenses, the cost of training and re-training of the service dog notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 22.3(2) of the Animal Protection Act and general damages for the respondents’ loss of a right to access the school."
e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and a waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. In issue was whether the defendants had misled consumers. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiffs had followed the judicial authority and determined that the defendants' summary judgment application was appropriate. The Court held that there was no genuine issue for trial and that the Court would continue to hear summary judgment applications before having to decide the plaintiffs' application for certification.  2) It was uncontroverted. The plaintiff misconstrued her own pleadings and seized upon what they believed was an admission that then emerged as the singular plank in their case. The case at hand was the one in hundred class action case where summary judgment is suitable. The more stringently the criteria of reliability and necessity must be applied, as it risks usurping the role of the trier of fact. In this case the Court was comfortable with following the steps set out in the Rules of Court and determining the defendants'. 3) The court was in agreement with the plaintiffs that this case was suitable for summary judgment. It was only the named plaintiffs that would be subject to this dismissal. There was no application before the Court with respect to the claims as a class as whole. The expert evidence submitted by the Plaintiffs was conclusive that the Defendants had not specifically directed their mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the Canadian statues or regulations or in short, the matters at hand."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office have rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the application; this is as a result of the request itself and it is not fair. Brabusess has not been paid in full for several bills submitted from January 2013 to October 2014. There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of the legal services the applicant has provided to the client. It is not sufficient to make a general complaint that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect the same amount of money to thereafter be scrutinized in detail."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in $5,250. The petitioner was successful in obtaining medical residency in Canada. The respondent was a pediatric pediatric pediatric critical care fellowship physician. He resided in Regina for several years. The family immigrated to Canada in 2001. They resided in Saskatoon until 2014, when they moved to Regina. They then parted for the final time in April 2014. The court granted the respondent interim primary residence of the petitioner and ordered that he should pay interim support for D.K. in the sum of $5k per month. The parties then moved to Ottawa, where they again took up residence. This time, the petitioner was no longer residing with the respondent. They subsequently relocated to Ottawa. The Court found that the petitioner had an income of approximately $309,700 and, after unsuccessfully applying for and obtaining an answer and counter petition, both of which were opposed to the petitioner seeking shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property. The latter claimed that he suffered from health and safety concerns related to his son. The administration of the federal child support guidelines was found to be in breach of the respondent’ s. 8(1) federal child tax return and the Child Tax Return Act. HELD: 1) The petitioner had a grade 5 student who was attending Montessori school. He was required to remain at the hospital every day. He also shared night call responsibilities three to four times per month and, on occasion, he was obliged to go into the hospital. He did not attend any of the parties’ school functions. The child was in grade 5. 2. 3. 4. 5. The father was to work 5 to 6 weeks a month. He lived in a rented condominium. It was not uncommon for him to be required to work from home. He spent weekends and evenings with the child. He claimed to have a better chance of obtaining employment in the future if he was permitted to travel to Pakistan. The mother was to pursue a pediatric residency. She also claimed that the respondent had unilaterally transferred the child to a private school. She alleged that the father had verbally and physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she did not return to him. 2) The respondent had been unable to contact the petitioner for more than 2 years. He had not taken a single vacation in two years and, aside from one"
