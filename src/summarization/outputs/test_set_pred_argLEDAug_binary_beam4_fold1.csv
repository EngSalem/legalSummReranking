The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of Investment Dealers Association. The appellant alleged that the panel acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging him with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were clearly not his responsibility. The charges involved disclosure of information about federal cabinet minister; permitting employees to take part in'side deals' (trades) in securities not approved by his head office; failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals; and failing to supervise an employee who was involved in side deals. Allowing the appeal, that the Board's findings of fact did not create any new rights, for which there was ample evidence, necessary to support its finding that the Charter had no application in the present case."
1991canlii4504.txt,"The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","The plaintiffs brought an application for exclusion of the grandchildren of the deceased, pursuant to s. 2(a) of the Fatal Injuries Act and s. 163 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia. The deceased had been killed in a motor vehicle accident. The action was commenced by the surviving plaintiffs in their various capacities. At issue was whether the plaintiffs should be excluded from hearing the evidence of each other. The surviving plaintiffs made various claims, including special damages and general damages under different heads. In interlocutory notice dated January 10, 1991, the defendants applied for an order excluding the grandchildren from their discovery examinations. No application had been made to exclude the plaintiff, Ronald J. Downie, who was the executor and trustee of the estate. HELD: 1)The inherent rights of the parties to attend the discovery should not be displaced by the mere assertion that 'the lines of questioning of each of the plaintiff grandchildren will be virtually identical'. There was no evidence before me that it would be of value to the plaintiffs in being able to assess what one another has said. 2)There was nothing to suggest that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the plaintiffs were not excluded. 3)The conduct of the examinations was to be determined by the judge at his discretion. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to costs."
1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.",The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v. Jessome. The defence had attempted to co-operate with the court in setting dates and co-operated to the extent that a witness was not available at the date of the trial. The judge granted the adjournment. The applicant's application was dismissed because he had not provided adequate evidence to satisfy the court's second test of the prerogative writ.
1994canlii3880.txt,"The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","A young offender pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and two counts of dangerous driving prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. He spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest under s.7.1 prior to being sentenced to 6 months' open custody, and two years probation substituted. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody and the amount paid by Saskatchewan Government Insurance for damage to vehicles was $21,062.71. 2)J.M.'s principal partner in these auto thefts was [T.D.] who received 8 months open Custody for some 19 auto thefts and attempts. He had made excellent progress in changing his ways. The father had acted as a strict jailer for a couple of months while he was in remand. 3)The sentences were to run consecutively so that his custodial disposition, in total, would be 10 months of open custody."

The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in Wisconsin, U.S.A.

1997canlii9808.txt,The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,Appellant sought to have support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V of the Court of Appeal at 1:00.
1998canlii13707.txt,"FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors. The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing until November to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. The Commission was not relying on a conviction and the onus is on the applicant to show a degree of prejudice if the civil proceedings are not stayed. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, and unlawfully cultivating marijuana pursuant to S. 6(1). A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed the accused standing at the rear of the van. He approached the accused and asked if there were any problems with the vehicle, asked if he wanted to empty his pockets, and then proceeded to try and open the black box. The accused said he had two cases of wine but that he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed. The police officer asked the accused where he was going and he was advised that he could not find anything of suspicious nature. At this point the officer told the accused that he was conducting an 'investigation' of a suspected drug dealer and the accused opened the door of the vehicle and asked him to open the door for the second case of wine. At the moment the questions were asked, the officer had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession of the accused. He proceeded to ask questions and in particular, questions of an investigative nature to see whether he might discover anything ofsuspicious nature. He also asked what temperature and humidity gauge on the inside of the beer cooler was and what was in the back of the truck. The defence argued the search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law. The Crown conceded there were no exigent circumstances upon which it could have obtained a warrant. The Court questioned the validity of the stop and the detention pursuant to ss. 10(b) and (c.o.o.) of the Charter. It is pertinent to note that the Court reviewed various authorities. In Simpson, a stopping vehicle observed at a suspected 'crack house' was an arbitrary detention from the moment it was pulled over by the RCMP officer. The evidence was found to be consistent with the common law confession rule, the rule against self-incrimination, and the fact that once the accused was arrested he could perform a search incidental to the arrest. In Young it was determined that the conversation was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case that there was reasonable and probable cause for warrantless inspection. The court held the accused had been detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to return to his seat, or when he put him"
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. In September 1998, this Court dismissed his appeal against the convictions and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on the advice of Mr.Halyk and then on the further advice of Dean MacKinnon the Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before them. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, it is not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of s.679(3) (a) and (c) of the section. Turning to the wider public interest, the issue of detaining the applicant would tend to undermine the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served. For essentially these reasons, the application for release was premature."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. The first motion was brought by the former police officer who alleged that the Crown had not commenced a new action against him within the time limit set out in the Limitation of Actions Act. He sought an order pursuant to Rule 188 allowing him to commence his own action against the AG and others for breach of his Charter rights. The second motion was granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die. It was not established until trial when any particular limitation period expires. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. The remaining substantive issues were determined."
2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and appear to be in the child's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this. The petitioner admits that she loves Keanna and has exercised access to her on a fairly regular basis. Both parties were ordered to complete a Parenting After Separation course. Both parents must file a certificate of completion once the course is completed.  1)The status quo is the current status quo for the child. She is doing well and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother. The court stated that it would rather have the child live with the respondent for an indefinite period of time than to have him solely reside with her. 2)Interim custody will be granted to the petitioner in the amount of $193 per month. The child shall have regular access on a second weekend, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods.  3)The petitioner shall have reasonable access including every other weekend, every second week, reasonable phone access and a reasonable access for those periods other than those specified by the order. The Court reviewed the various affidavits of family members and relatives of the parties. They were of no assistance in determining the specific time periods wherein the respondent purported to have access. They are all consistent in establishing one thing; that the child did not have plenty of access to the child at various times from 1999 to 2003. The mother has been exercising access with the daughter on fairlyregular basis. 4)The court found that the petitioner's income for the purposes of interim child support to be $4,921.96 (the average of her 2000 and 2001 income) and that the mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the parties was self-evident and commendable. The father shall pay child support of $125 per month commencing with $206 per month for one year and $207 for two years thereafter."
2004skca100.txt,"The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s. 8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992, s.6.001 and Regulations made thereunder. The stay was granted upon the applications of the respondent corporations and was to remain in effect until an action against them, not a party to these proceedings, was settled or otherwise completed. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was the same, namely certain monies the husband had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The court found that the finding that the Superintendent did not have the powers he claimed to have and purported to exercise was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The decision was left open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced. The matter was addressed as a preliminary issue only without any adjudication on the merits. It is impossible to address the scope and breadth of statutory provision in the absence of a factual context, which was lacking here."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court retained the interest they acquired in their own pensions and spousal support and agreed to designate the parents as joint custodians of the children. The parties agreed to share parenting time with the children every second weekend and to allow the respondent to make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost. The respondent was to apply for a share of the child care costs in the Corollary Relief Judgment. The mother sought to vary the parenting time so that she and the child would equally share their time. HELD: The current parenting arrangements have been in place for five years and there is no evidence that a change is necessary nor would improve the parent/child relationship. The parents have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest for the last five years. The alternating of holidays would not appear to be contrary to the children's interest and would appear beneficial to the parents and grant the respondent's request in that regard. The current arrangements are in effect with the exception of one change regarding Remembrance Day. Child support payments are to be made by the respondent for child care expenses in the amount of $647 per month beginning June 1, 2006.  1)The current arrangements would appear to create a distinct and distinct child base for the children and to be in the best interests of the parties. 2)The respondent would be required to pay $100 per month in child support and an additional $100 for support in the Maintenance Enforcement Program.  3)The parties had been unable to establish a pattern in their interaction with each other. There was no evidence presented to show that this current situation was, or would be, harmful to their children.  4)Each party will retain an interest of $46,240 for the purpose of child support. Spousal Support will not increase as the parents move from one residence to another and the children will continue to spend time with their mother."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and with possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to S. 88. The accused claimed that he was facing an imminent attack when the accused stepped toward the accused holding the knife or that the accused would throw the knife at him if he retreated fully from the property. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes that Mr. Colley intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the accused causing him to suffer wounds. The Court was unable to believe the accused that he could ever have thought that his friend, who was his uncle by marriage, was faced with a threat of armed robbery or that he would throw a knife at the accused if he were forced to retreat."
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.",The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: 1) The children were apprehended from their mother S.D. (the'mother'). The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including one expert witness. The expert witness testified that S.T. was involved in a relationship with another woman and that the mother was hostile to the Ministry's workers and sometimes threatened to sue the school if she did not get custody of the children. She advised the mother that she would not allow the mother to monitor her diabetes closely and advised her of the importance of continuity in the child's care. 3) The mother did not appear for trial because she was ill. The father of two children testified that he did not want the children to be put in the care of the mother. 4) The evidence in this matter focused on the mother's change from being a mother to someone who actually cared for the children and who was willing and able to provide for their needs. It was also pertinent to consider the father's recommendations regarding long term custody.
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations and entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. The quality requirements of the contract had been met. There were no concerns expressed whatsoever by Bio Canada that there was any problem with the oats delivered by the plaintiff. It was the farmer's responsibility to ensure that his oats were delivered with a quality standard. On the evidence he had complied with that obligation. There was nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed.  2) Although the plaintiff's claim for pre-judgment interest was claimed, he was entitled to interest on the sum owing to him from the 26th day of September 2006 until the date of judgment."

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.

Dismissing the appeal, that the evidence was fully informed and voluntary. Even though the accused's written consent was largely irrelevant, the fact that he consented to the sample was nothing more than to ease or bolster the application for a warrant and was therefore 'extraneous'.

2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. The by-laws prohibited the erection of any sign without a permit and stipulated that a sign had to relate to the property on which it was located. The application was allowed and an order was made pursuantto s266(3) of the municipal government act directing the respondents to remove the sign. The Town conceded that the by-law limited freedom of expression and limited it, but the Court of Appeal determined that these rights were demonstrably justified pursuant to ss.2(b) and 3 of the Charter. The trial judge found that the Town had chosen to operate in a manner that was completely outside the scope of its means and effectively addressed unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. He found that by permitting anyone to ignore the requirement for certification on the basis of a religious conviction, which would create an unwarranted burden on the operation of a legitimate legislative scheme to assure a reasonable standard of education. The limiting measures of the bylaw are rationally connected to the objective and it effectively addresses unrestricted useof available space to maximize the use of sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the Sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. The mother's attendance at the trial was not totally supported by the evidence. Whether the mother would be required to produce her father's financial records is another matter. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation, owned by Janice Petersen's husband, should be disclosed. The petitioner's application for payment of child maintenance was dismissed, with costs to the petitioner to the extent of $500.  Although the petitioner's father's income is deposited into a joint bank account, into which the breadwinner deposits his or her earnings, does not justify imputing portion of that income to the homemaker spouse. The fact that the corporation owns but one truck, operated by Mr. Petersen, from which all of the income of the corporation is derived, the suggestion that income from the corporation should be imputed to the mother is nothing less then ludicrous. Although both parties maintain joint bank accounts, unlike in many households, there is not a shred of evidence to support that statement. The respondent has produced his income tax returns, prepared by his accountant, but has no farm/cattle income or expense banking accounts of her own, she has no permit book and offers nothing to substantiate her annual income derived from the farming and cattle operation with her dad other than her annual tax returns. The Court was unable to find anything to support the respondent's assertion that the petitioner has not produced any financial information relevant to the proceedings because she has not canvassed the financial picture in the absence of her father."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the failure to remit the rent, failed to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Certificate of Appeal was upheld. The Law Society disbarred the appellant for fabricating documents to cover negligence in conducting his client's legal action. The Board of Trade fined the appellant $100,000 for violations of the Act and required the appellant to complete a new salesperson licensing course. The appellant was to pay the hearing costs and must complete the new Salesperson Licensing course within 30 days of the decision. In a written decision filed on May 6, 2004, the Committee imposed sanctions. The central issue in determining the standard of review is whether general deterrence is an appropriate consideration in formulating a penalty fell within the Commission's expertise and the Court emphasized that reasons had to be meaningful in the sense of providing some proper basis for review. As the Act does not contain a privative clause, less deference should be given to the decision than a rule, policy, guideline or precedent. The Supreme Court of Canada held that there were only three standards of review and that reasonableness should not lead a reviewing court infer bad faith or that no legally valid reasons existed. The Standard of review as it applies to the imposition of sanctions by administrative tribunals has been discussed by the Supreme Court in Cartaway, and Ryan, and is applicable to judicial review of administrative decision-making. The court adopts the third option. It is a matter of fairness, after the sanctions have been quashed, that the decision be reconsidered, taking into account all the relevant factors."

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for shared parenting. Since that time, the children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of their separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a'shared parenting arrangement'. The respondent argues (3) that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered.  4) There is no suggestion (5) the parties' children have suffered a dramatic drop in income and they no longer desire to be trained as a nurse. 5) The parties' home is now in their former matrimonial home.  6) The respondent is paying $3,000 per month as immediate commission income when new assets are brought under his management and (7) an annual fee or commission that he receives for his ongoing management of the subject assets. The Corollary Relief judgment will be granted in accordance with s. 17 of the Divorce Act."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","PricewaterhouseCoopers, receiver and manager of Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (the plaintiff) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer at separate locations in Rosetown, Saskatchewan and Elrose, Saskatchewan. In 1999, the plaintiff entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers, including New Holland Canada, Ltée, Case Canada Corporation and Flexi-Coil Ltd. The latter two suppliers granted the plaintiff lines of credit on the security of present and after-acquired product inventory. In 2003, the three suppliers became part of CNH Canada Ltd.(CNH Canada). In 2006, both the plaintiff and the defendant companies commenced action against each other claiming that they were entitled to certain security under the terms of the respective priority agreements. At issue was whether the direct shipped parts in this case were'specially ordered' by the plaintiff or whether CNH was obliged to purchase certain parts from the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was adjusted to $88,724.59 because the contractual provisions clearly entitle the plaintiff to refuse to restock direct ship parts. In the context in which the issue has arisen, this is a collateral matter which has no impact on the outcome except as to costs. 1)The priority agreement between the parties was not the same as the receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the receiver to CNH were returned to the receiver. 2)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $19,059.26. The defendant companies were awarded costs of the auction. 3)The court was unable to follow the fine distinctions required to support the plaintiff's position that the goods/parts issue was the cornerstone of the priority agreement. There was no evidence before the court that the plaintiff was seeking to enforce its security or that the priority extended to the plaintiff by paragraph 4.2 includes only assets that are not 'NHCC Financed Collateral'. 4)Each party was entitled to a share in the value of the proceeds from the sale of goods and services. The court was not able to determine the precise amount of credit owed by each party. 5)The parties were on common ground that in agreement pursuant to s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Regulations, the parties had assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements and that they had a mutual understanding that parts specially ordered would not be returnable. 6)There was no dispute that the items in issue were specifically identified as 'goods'.

2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and possession of stolen property. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that he was breathing rapidly and that his 'carotid artery' was 'pulsating' and he was concerned that the driver might have been drinking. The officers observed fresh black caulking around various external panels and at the front corners of both sides of the motor home. The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. of the CDSA was infringed when they approached his vehicle and pried the panel of the vehicle to reveal a large amount of cocaine. 2) There were no obvious signs of gross or alcohol consumption or of impairment. The interior of the car was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The motor home had been issued only one license plate and two temporary operating permits. 3) There was no evidence that the accused, who had a previous conviction for auto theft, was carrying contraband. The evidence was excluded as a result of the violation of his Charter rights."
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility. This robbery took place in a small room with only three persons present. The trial judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant's culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond reasonable doubt based on the testimony offered by the witnesses. While Justice Bryson did not specifically refer to R. v. W.(D), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, he recognized their importance and that he didn't fall into that trap of trying to lump Crown and Defence evidence into a credibility contest."

There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made.

2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused is charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Canadian Criminal Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. After being observed walking through an area well known for street level drug trafficking, where crack cocaine users approach dealers on the public street and arrange to purchase a single stone or rock of crack cocaine in a transaction that takes mere seconds to complete for the consideration of a single $20 bill. At issue was whether the accused stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. HELD: The accused is found guilty on both counts. 1) The evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene to observe the transaction was credible. The encounters between the accused and the seller were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations.  2) The interactions between the buyer and the accused are consistent with the trafficking practices described by the police officers. There was no evidence that the accused initiated the purchase of the cocaine from another source other than by gesturing to another place for the transaction to take place. It was not uncommon for the accused to take something out of the baggy and place it in a rock wall to avoid detection by police. His evidence concerning what he observed of the transaction is consistent with those of other drug trafficking users. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in the plastic baggy was also very helpful to the defence in having an opportunity to challenge the observations of the officers. 3) The presence of a cigarette lighter at the end of the pipe or in the corner of the store was consistent with trafficking offences contrary to s. 4(3)(a)(ii). The observations of both officers were corroborated by the evidence of another officer who testified that he observed the same person walking through the same area at the same time. 4) The observations by the officer who observed the transaction were inconsistent with the pattern of conduct by other drug traffickers and were not helpful in establishing immediacy of the purchase. The officer's analysis of the transactions was helpful in reconciling the conflicting accounts of events that led to the conclusion that the transactions were trafficking offences and consistent with that pattern. 5) There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the person who purchased the cocaine was the purchaser of the drugs from the other location.

They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The applicants applied for solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff 'C' to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements. The Bowsers, who were seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, requested costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of the expenses that the dispute in this case concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The dispute started in May 2011 and was generally conducted in civil fashion as evidenced by the Sheas' consent to late filing of the Notice of Contest and the Bowsers' consent of filing the Rebuttal Affidavit. Ultimately, the sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct."

He sought leave to appeal and appeals from his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently. The charges arose out of an information alleging that the appellant, who had an argument with his girlfriend at her home, had his headlights off and collided with a westbound Mazda pickup truck driven by the three people injured.

The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary the February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury. HELD: 1)It was significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide for a material change in circumstances. The parties had three children. The respondent understandably did not work during the marriage. Fortunately the matrimonial property division provided her with sufficient financial means so that she was not required to seek employment after the parties separated. 2)The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been amaterial change in circumstance. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation pursuant to s15.2 of the Divorce Act, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. 3)There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It is essential that he know now what his future obligations are. As each party has had some measure of success, no costs are awarded to either party."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for delegation to the Minister, for the duty of preparing and filing returns for tax purposes. The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. The question raised is not arguable merit nor matter of sufficient importance to warrant review by the Court. The Court may convict if it finds that the accused participated either as a principal or party. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Section 330 of the Code provides for an implicit scheme of delegation of authority to override an explicit statutory or regulatory one. It does not require the exercise of a Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of his or her rights by restricting any right to appeal. 2)There was no evidence to justify the trial judge's finding that returns were not filed nor to justify his finding that there was unreasonable delay which compromised the appellants' right to a fair trial. The demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign."

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in law in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. The court also found that once ITI decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the students. It also held that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any agreement of sale within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v). The appeal was allowed and an order issued directing return of the goods or payment of their value. The respondent was ordered to pay the appellant costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of costs of the appeal. Leave to appeal was granted as the matter had not been allowed and the order would issue a directing return in the amount of $5,000. The appellant was to prepare the order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court and the respondent's submission to Court."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The application was dismissed. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge's responsibility to ensure a fair and public hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial may be declared. 2)The appeal must be allowed. There is an abundance authority that a disclosure of a accused's Criminal Record to the Court, whether a judge composed of judge, jury or jury alone does not automatically disqualify the Court on the basis of apprehended or evidential bias or bias. The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 3)Every individual charged with a criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fairand public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. Although there is an overriding faith in the jury system, assuming that juries should be properly instructed as to the limited use which may be made of evidence that the accused was previously convicted of criminal offences, one must assume that trial judges fully comprehend those instructions. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced. This evidence was something that could put out of its mind as she put it in her mind. A standard of perfection would then be required of the Crown, which humans are quite incapable of achieving."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. He was ordered to pay $600 per month as support for the child. His application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. HELD: 1) The father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to either pay full-time child support or to rescind the obligation entirely. The mother's decision to work only 3 months of the year and to return only to school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  2) On all of the evidence it is clear that the father's financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support. The court has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding, which delays were primarily the result of his unwillingness to provide adequate financial disclosure. 3) The mother has requested costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  4) The primary questions to be answered by the court are whether the father is underemployed and if so, whether he has intentionally made a decision that appears to be more aggressively pursuing his child's education and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has been successful."

An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","The Court of Appeal dismissed the application for an order for costs. The Court found no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of the 2 year old son of the father to his father. The Father had not previously been regular access to the Child. HELD: The Appeal was dismissed. The award of maintenance was not unreasonable having regard for the length of the relationship (15 years), the husband'swage (approximately $55,000 per year) and the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home. The trial judge also chose to accept the testimony of an expert witness who testified as to relationships within the family.

4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have a member of a previous firm barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a similar ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following a change of solicitors. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. 1)Much is made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By such reference to strategy counsel seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that is, one which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 2)Once it is determined there is no actual knowledge of the case in question and that there could be no actual information of the matter in question having arisen after the change, the onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifts to the party asserting the concern."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant, Medical Services Incorporated for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 for pneumothorax, collapsed lung, and costs to be taxed. 1)The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. 2)The evidence of the two qualified physicians who treated Hurd in Chicago was not clear. Neither doctor detected or made mention that they even suspected bleb, which could have resulted in a condition pre-existing the policy. 3)Travel was dangerous and put Hurd's life in jeopardy. The Court concluded that Hurd was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery. 4)The term of insurance exempts MSI from payment because of a condition existing the effective date of the policy (e.g. pre-existing the condition). 5)The fact that the insurance policy was purchased by MSI in 1998 was essentially pre-conditions for the plaintiff's return to the United States, which precludes reimbursement for expenses incurred while outside the province of Saskatchewan for medical services which could reasonably have been delayed until the patient returned to Canada, unless the medical condition reasonably prevented the Insured from returning to Saskatchewan prior to such treatment or surgery. 6)The Court accepted the opinion of the attending physician, who expressed views contrary to those of the defendant's physician, but did so in support of one of the reasons for non-payment. The defendant did not raise this issue as an issue."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. HELD: 1) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. As the child's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support, no support shall be ordered at this time. 2) There are two lines of judicial authority dealing with the meaning of 'intentionally under-employed or unemployed' One line of authority holds that “intentionally” means “voluntarily”. It applies where parent chooses to be under- or unemployed. This case does not. 3) The evidence does not support a finding of intentional unemployment. The child has been unemployed since May 2003. There is no evidence that he is being anything other than honest with regard to his financial circumstances. The only issue is whether the Court can impute income to him pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Child Support Guidelines set out the basis for an undue hardship claim. Such a claim involves two steps. First, the applicant must establish that the child is capable of earning more income than is normally required; second, establish that her standard of living is less than that of the other spouse. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to establish why the table amount would cause undue hardship for her."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence was the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The Crown argued that if the court agrees that the warrants as issued are invalid then the resultant search of Smith's residence and its surrounding premises was warrantless search. The evidence satisfied the court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The Court found that both the warrants were valid and that they authorized the search. However, the Court questioned whether the evidence obtained as a result of the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. HELD: 1) The Court accepted the Crown's argument that only if both warrants are found to be invalid the CDSA and Code warrants are valid that the seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and the vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and valid. 2) It was unfortunate from the perspective of the Crown that none of the reviewing supervisory officers, the issuing Justice in Saskatchewan or the Endorsing Justice in British Columbia read the warrants presented with sufficient care or attention. Nor do they read properly from the standpoint of simple English. 3) The evidence satisfies the Court on the balance of probabilities that the search was authorized by reasonable law and carried out in a reasonable manner. The accused was the only occupant of the premises. During the search the Court was able to conclude that the various elements of an offence must be sufficient, even in a warrant, to identify, to person confronted with a warrant to search his dwelling, the offences in respect of which the warrant authority is required and therefore the search warrant authorization pertains. 4) In the absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the drugs, these investigations and the informations to obtain the search warrants were the responsibility of and the effect of exclusion/inclusion upon the repute of the administration of justice."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The application is pursuant to s17 of the Divorce Act. The relevant portions of that Act have an effect on how the Court deals with the request. 2) There is a presumption in favour of retroactive support (i.e. that it is reasonable and consistent with the obligations of child support that payor be required to pay) and that the presumption applies regardless of the nature of the application, whether it is an interim or final one.  3) The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed with many of the factors on this issue. There was no evidence before the Court as to how that presumption was to be exercised. 4) There are a number of factors that may militate against or favor retroactive child support orders. In L.S. v. E.P. the presumption is not supported by the evidence. 5) The British Columbia court of appeal identified a non-exhaustive list of factors which may mitigate for or against the presumption. It was not possible to provide a comprehensive list of all of the relevant factors. 6) The parties have remarried and they continue to live in close proximity to each other. The Court has no power to order a variation of the existing support order."

The learned judge did not make an error in law.","The appellant appeals the judgment of the Provincial Court pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.

The learned trial judge erred in allowing the Plaintiffs claim against a body corporate duly registered in the Province of Saskatchewan when it had agreed to honour its warranty by repairing the transmission provided the plaintiff bring the same to the defendant to have it repaired. The respondent shall not take any steps to enforce the judgment within 30 days to enable the appellant to comply with the order. An appeal is not a trial de novo but an appeal on the record and the findings of fact by the trial judge must be given a high degree of appellate deference. Housen v.

Kivela (2006) that same court dismissed the appellant's appeal. The court did not make an error of law based on the standard of correctness. It was not aware of any palpable and overriding error during trial. In the trial, the appellant was able to cite numerous grounds respecting the warranty, the term and condition of sale, the vehicle which had an odometer reading in excess of 300,000 km and the agreement to reduce the sale price from $4,995 to $3,360 for the plaintiff accepting the vehicle with some repair to the steering mechanism.

4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The mother sought shared parenting with the father. The parties had been in a relationship for approximately thirty years and had two children, aged 15 and 18. The children were in the mother's care every second weekend. The mother alleged the husband was abusive to the wife and had sought an equal time shared parenting arrangement. The father sought to have the custody of the children placed in the wife's custody. The wife did not participate in the parenting process as she was not a credible witness. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate for the children, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the best interest of them. Both parties have demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. This has resulted in the vitiation of virtually all direct communication with the children. They do not meet face to face and do not talk on the phone. Their e-mails are curt at best. They use their children as a means of communicating with them. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties is one factor that must be considered."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure.HELD: The accused's rights were infringed. The Operational Checksheets and any reference to Exhibit P-2 in the re-direct examination of the accused were excluded from evidence at this trial.  1) The police officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the condition at the detachment. The information operating or in care or control of a vehicle over.08 was dismissed by the defence application for nonsuit. 2) The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Chechsheets and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown Prosecutor. That said, the prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during Cst. Pshyk's re-direction testimony and introduced the Checksheet into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. In the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this trial, the Court was satisfied that his rights under s. 7 were breached. The officer would not have challenged the prosecutor on his failure to made mention that the accused's speech was slurred. That is because, had he known the full contents of the original check sheet, he would have known that such a question would have inevitably drawn the Re-examination examination which occurred in this case."

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and for inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate causes of action. The first claim, wrongful dismissal, was advanced by the plaintiffs against both the defendants and the plaintiff. The second cause was for defamation. HELD: 1) Rule 7-9 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for strikes on pleadings submitted by the applicants in relation to various issues of claim. The pleadings contain indirect quotes attributed to the defendant and other defendants. 2) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) of the statement of claim describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 3) The plaintiff's claim for moral damages was struck as being material to the issue of wrongful dismissal. 4) The facts in para. 50 were immaterial to the plaintiffs' case as they were not relevant to the issues to be tried. 5) There was no attempt to connect extrinsic evidence reported on by news agencies and the issues between Banga and the defendant with the pleadings. Rather, they were mere platitudes.  6) The defendants were granted costs of the application in the amount of $35,000 to the plaintiff for the cause of defamation."

She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.",HELD: The Court held that the two actions would be heard because of common issues and because it would be a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if the patient was well enough to leave on her own.

5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.",The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The applicants had entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with the intention of carrying out their business. A fire in 1995 had damaged the landlord's insurance policy and the landlord had insured against loss of business for 30 years. The tenants were in arrears of rent by more than 2 months and had failed to obtain and maintain suitable insurance. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenants of the lease as alleged with respect to the demised premises and the alleged failure to maintain proper weed control. The respondents admitted the payment due May 1998 was not made because the tenant had breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a pre-condition to the lease wherein the landlord promised to repair the damage. The affidavit evidence did not draw the inference that that is failure on the part of the tenants to use and occupy in a good husband like manner. With respect to all of the other allegations raised it would be necessary to have a trial.

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"An application under Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for income replacement benefits contending that the accident caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance denied the claim. The applicant applied for review of its decision and appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities. Based on the evidence of his family physician and the doctor who treated the applicant prior to the accident, there is no doubt that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit calculated pursuant to this section.  2)Accident is defined in s.100(1)(a) as any event in which bodily injury is caused by an automobile. The onus on the plaintiff to establish the claim to these benefits is on him. 3)The applicant was not diagnosed as suffering from a herniated disc or from any injury or dysfunction of the discs. He was generally in good health and had no evidence of any back problems. His back pain, which was already worsening post-accident, was in the same area as the pain he suffered after the accident.

The respondent shall bear interest from the day such payment is due for the account of the operator at a rate two (2) percentage points higher than the then prevailing prime bank interest rate charged by the operator with respect to the operation of the joint account. 6) There was no question the respondent was not responsible for all of the costs incurred.

He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'.

In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused, a young person within the meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the accused. The police had intercepted the stolen vehicle at the Halifax Youth Justice Court and, in the presence of a third party, they had also intercepted the vehicle's registration plate. The driver and sole occupant were not completely undressed at any one time. The strip search was conducted as a result of the arrest and was conducted for the purpose of preserving evidence and preventing its destruction.

5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused applied to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the accused had not seen the video of the alleged assault when he plead guilty, nor that a language/communication issue prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of sexual assault. The accused’s evidence regarding his lack of knowledge of the nature of the allegation and its effect on his ability to have contact with his son was not credible.

In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused.

5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving a motor vehicle contrary to Criminal Code s.253(1)(a) and (2)having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1(b) of the Criminal Code and having been in possession of a small amount of stolen property. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no error of law. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The accused was not provided an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The officer did not return to the accused to check the spelling of the name. Rather, another name was sought from and provided by the accused. When that was not done, the accused was transported to his home in Carlyle."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter, and that evidence obtained should be excluded. At issue was whether the Information To Obtain Search Warrant (ITO) was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO, and whether it could have been used to support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. HELD: The application of the Court was dismissed. The search of the computer immediately after the voir dire was held did not result in a breach of the accused's Charter rights. Although the Court could have taken judicial notice of the capabilities of a cellular phone generally, and guess whether this particular one would be within the broad description of a device capable of storing images or other relevant data, it was never suggested that relevant material was found on this cellular telephone. The seizure of the cellular phone does not appear covered by the warrant. A search of a computer without further authorization or in the presence of a lawyer or other adult was not an unreasonable step in an investigation. It is of significant importance that the Court be able to determine the adequacy and reliability of the information contained in such a comprehensive manner, without prejudicing the justice's assessment of the facts in this case.  1) The Court was satisfied that the Information to Obtain the Search warrant was valid. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence of sexual assault, or creation of child pornography, but rather that it was a reasonable and probable ground to believe that evidence of that offence would be found in the specified location. 2) There was no evidence obtained as a result of this search by the respondent, who did not wish to be associated with the investigation of this matter but wished to be advised of the gravity of the breach by the justice in this matter. It was of significance that no prescriptive evidence could be obtained by reason of the alleged denial of rights, which is of significance in considering an appropriate remedy if a breach is established.  3) The court found that given the detail of the documents to be searched, the omission of cellular telephones, and the suggestion to search for explicitly sexual pictures, (which could suggest unwarranted sexual inferences) could not be found. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief which is not sufficient to nullify the"

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.",The vendors and their predecessors in title had established a good and marketable possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property. The plaintiffs brought an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants was without merit. Application granted in part; the evidence submitted by the vendors/plaintiffs was so remote as to be frivolous and as such was not a valid object to title.

6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. HELD: The defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded by ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failing of yield, the defence of due diligence was established. 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. 2)The plaintiff failed to yield properly.  3)When he commenced his turn across the path of the Tempo, any vehicle lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to have a reasonable opportunity to the driver of the approaching vehicle to avoid collision.  4)The court found that the defendant did not have an absolute right, nor did it relieve him from compliance with his common law and statutory duty to drive with due care in the circumstances.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for filing a bond contained in s. 55(1). Almost every application would so qualify because in most cases the nearest relatives and public trustee consent in writing. 2) The Court was not able to conclude this was an appropriate situation to dispensed with a Bond. The application to be appointed personal decision making-makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. With respect to the application for property guardianship no order was made. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so.  3) One answer was to request the public trustee to become the property guardian pursuant to s. 30(b). The fees charged by thepublic trustee are set out in Regulation to The Public Guardian and Trustee Act and are not to be requested by the court. 4) The court should impose more strict conditions where the applicant is seeking to be appoint without the need of bond."

The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period.

The appellant appeals. He argues the Rules gave the judge discretion to grant the amendment; and that the judge should have granted it. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the order of the chambers judge and ordering that the appellant be allowed to renew the application; and allowing the proposed new defendant to apply in the Supreme Court, that the decision of the judge on the limitation period is made with the express purpose of giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard.

The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.

6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and thus misapplied them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. The convictions were set aside and the fines and surcharges were restored. 1)The circumstances in this case were such that an appeal was appropriate. The appeal should not have been allowed as it went beyond the extent and effect of the trial judge's decision. 2)The court was of the opinion the judge had misapprehended the provisions and in consequence mislied them and mislied the Act. The judge was too much concerned in the abstract with the potential scope of these provisions, fearing, as he did, that as one moved from the meaning of them at the centre to their potential meaning at the periphery, they reached beyond the contemplation of the legislature, especially in the context of the commission of an offence.  3)The Court of Appeal did not err in its division of the appeal. It was not concerned in its abstract analysis with the intent to narrow the scope of licensing provisions well beyond that which it intended by the legislature in light of the overall purpose, the licensing scheme and its objects and the cast of the provisions in question."

The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The appeal revolves around s. 2 of the LCRA. Where land is hereafter sold under an agreement for sale in writing, or mortgaged whether by legal or equitable mortgage for the purpose of securing the purchase price of the land affected, or where mortgage is hereafter given as collateral security for the sale price of that land, the vendor's or purchaser's interest payments are to be divided and applied proportionately. 2) The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings are the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision.  3) The interest payments on the purchase money debt and non Purchase money portion of the debt is to be paid to the purchaser first. 4) The sale proceeds of the sale should be used against the mortgage balance first or sue for the balance. 5) The conclusion in Andrew is not binding. The loan is decreased to $132,582.48 and is protected by s. 25 of The Land Contracts (Actions) Act. 6) The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take out deficiency judgment against the appellants in $31,160.23. 7) The court referred to the decision of the Chambers judge in Andrew. In that case, the respondent sought an order for solicitor-client costs being set aside. In its place, the court provided an order that either party may return the matter of costs relating to the motion for a resolution of the foreclosure proceeding. 8) The respondent appealed the decision and sought determination as to the extent to which s.2 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to the mortgage debt on a pro rata basis and to the balance owing of the mortgage.

The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time of trial was an inmate. The police officer testified that he asked the doctor for permission to take the blood and that the doctor advised him that the accused would be kept in hospital. The attending physician testified at trial that he had no recollection of who actually took the blood, the doctor's opinion that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health, and he described the accused as being focused on the needs of his patient. HELD: On the evidence as whole, the Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. 1)There was no evidence to suggest that the officer had ever obtained information from the doctor which would have been of any assistance to the Crown in this matter. 2)The facts were in the officer's mind when he made the demand. 3)The Court found that the medical practitioner had no real recollection of taking the blood nor of signing the second certificate. The doctor clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that there would be any danger to the life of the other person. The Court was also satisfied that the Certificate of Analysis was not signed by the doctor. The Certificate of Recognition was not issued to the officer."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","An action for divorce based on separation. In issue were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance and division of the matrimonial home. The petitioner sought costs. HELD: 1)The marriage breakdown was established. The parties had been living separate and apart since January 1998. The divorce was granted.  2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the husband. Maintenance for the couple's two children was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 3)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of $21,804.38 to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as, in the case of each child, that child continues to be a child of the marriage as defined in the Divorce Act.  4)Spousal support in the form of $900 per month payable every month commencing January 1/01/2001 was reduced to $485 subject to any additions pursuant to s.7. 5)The parties had agreed on joint custody of the children in addition to the loans from the Canada Trust secured against the title to the property, and that the parties would equally share the children's time during school vacations.  6)Costs were to be divided according to the formula adopted in Hamel v. Heron (2000), 157 Nfld. P.E.I.R. 42 (Sask. Q.B.). 7)Each party was to contribute his proportionate share of the orthodontic treatment expenses for the children that is not covered by insurance. 8)The wife was to convey half of her share to the respondent for the purposes of distribution pursuant to the Matrimonial Property Act, 1997. 9)Any adjustments would involve considerable speculation and the court was not prepared to allow such speculation. 10)The court ordered that the value of the termination benefit as of the date of the petition was $27,333.50 and that it should be divided 73 percent."

He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had never paid any child support voluntarily under the previous orders and was in default of the disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order. He applied to vary the maintenance order even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; dismissal of the application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material; the court erred in allowing the application to proceed even though the father had not disclosed any income tax information for the 2002 and 2003 years and claimed a medical disability of which he had given no previous notice. The absence of disclosure was unfair to the mother as it prevented her from making full response to the father's application."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08) and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty on all charges.  2) The officer was surprised that he did not see the signs of impairment in the accused's person that his driving suggested and, most significantly, that his level of intoxication was in his view borderline and he required an ASD test to give him the grounds to make an Intoxilyzer demand. 3) The evidence was not credible. The accused's evidence was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the history he gave to alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott. 4) The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, effected his recollection of this day and what he drank."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arose. In concurrence with the court of justice, that a new Trial was ordered. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. 1)The Chief Judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 2)If indeed the Provincial court judge had found that under s.(213)the actus rus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. 3)The facts before the Chief Judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female personfor the purposes of exchanging in sexual intercourse and for which he intended to pay. The evidence was that the Respondent approached a woman unknown to him in an area where prostitutes were plying their trade, invited her into his automobile, inquired if she was interested in sex and wanted to know if the police officer was a police officer. She was not adding the need for specific conversation. 4)A new trial ordered. This appeal arises from the judgment of QBCA 18 of 1995. There is no need in view of our disposition to conduct an extensive review of the facts. A new trial is ordered."
8_1999canlii12618.txt,"Plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the AAIA requiring SGI to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in an earlier judgment. The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded in a 1998 judgment. The defendant applied to strike the plaintiff's claim, saying s.102 of the Act precludes an action for damages as a result of the intentional inflicting of harm on a victim by use of motor vehicle, “then it is an actionable tort to beat someone up in Saskatchewan with a baseball bat but not so if the assailant uses an automobile”. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of The Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. There will be no order as to costs. Herbert v. Misuga (1994), 116 Sask. R. 292 (C.A.) involved claim against the defendant motor vehicle driver for damages for assault and battery. The action was brought more than 1 year after the injuries were inflicted. The question to be resolved was whether s. 143 of the then The Vehicles Act, 1983, repealed by The Vehicle Administration Act, S. 1986, c. V-2.1 applied. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion and stated that the limitation period in s.143(1)(a) of the Vehicles Act was indistinguishable from the wording in s.(1) of The Vehicles act, 1983. The plaintiff had no cause of action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile."
8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses, by the plaintiff's unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras, and for which it has never been paid. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contractual obligation and any variation in wording between the previous invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender is inconsequential. The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to do this it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being banked and thereby reduce the build up of methane gas and the risk of fire within the banks. The equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender, and no objection appeared to have been taken with the equipment delivered to the site."

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: break and enter a dwelling house; theft; jewellery; breach of an undertaking given to a justice or a judge and being bound to comply with a condition that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour and fail without lawful excuse to complywith that condition contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code; break and enters; theft. The sentencing judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that he was released early at his own request in December 1999. The community support for the respondent, his education and technical trade training and the fact he spent time on remand were factors in the decision. HELD: A sentence of three to four years is allowed on the basis that when one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. The conditional sentence must be considered when the Crown begins monitoring the record for post-sentence offences. A community disposition is likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the offender. As the Crown has already acknowledged the gravity of the offences and the seriousness of the sentence imposed, the community must be put on notice that these offences are a danger to the public good and that this offender is in a position to make an effort to get out of the prison and into the good behaviour of his community. This offender was 38 years old with 49 prior convictions. He had 49 previous convictions. The sentence imposed was based on a three-year conditional sentence."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced a class action against the defendants and third parties in June 2006. The defendants appealed that decision and applied to stay the action. They sought the same discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court. They argued that the action and these proceedings were an abuse of the court”s process and that the court had the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. HELD: The application to stay was granted and the stay application was dismissed. The court found that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were not directed to this court but to be considered by the court during the certification application. These concerns were specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the Court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted.  1) The Court was not inclined to engage in an exploration of the general approach which Saskatchewan courts should take in the face of typical overlapping multi-jurisdictional class actions (see: Wuttunee v. Merck Frosst Canada Ltd., 2008 SKQB 229). 2) Traffic control as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in Canada in respect of CFB Gagetown claims was the responsibility of the Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and (3) of the Act. The Court reviewed the history of the various types of class action and chose the Saskatchewan action as representative of a class of persons residing in each province and territory (including Newfoundland and Labrador). 3) The Saskatchewan action was unique in that it was commenced in different jurisdictions. There were significant geographic and other scopes to the New Brunswick action, including a far wider list of damaging'substances', a larger group of defendants and broader scope of causes of action."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The Mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and was an abuser of marijuana. The Mother was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child and would be in danger of physical harm if he were left in the care of the Father. Both parties during the most recent incident had an opportunity to prevent escalation. The mother could have allowed the father to take the jacket and leave without getting into a tug-of-war with the father. The father did not admit to threats to harm the child nor about his placing her in situations where there were peanuts present. HELD: 1)Joint custody does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. 2)The Father is to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. 3)There must be evidence to suggest there is a realistic likelihood that the Father would take the child away from the Mother and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. If there is no reason to change the existing situation, that situation should continue until trial."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appealed a decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The father argued that the chambers judge erred by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis for imposing a maximum contact principle on all of the evidence. 2) The evidentiary record as controverted as it is, is not lacking to the point where the judge had no proper basis for her decision. She was obliged to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination; and 3) there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence on material issues which could not be used to support a decision made on affidavit evidence alone.

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.",This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal set aside; conviction entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm. Both counsels for the respondent requested that the matter be remitted to trial judge for sentence as there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had the requisite intent for the offence of common assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed. 1)The trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude that the respondent had the minimal intent required for a general intent offence. 2)The Court was of the view that intoxication falling short of insanity or automatism is not a defence to crimes of general intent. 3)The evidence of his wife showed that he did not strike her. The wife's evidence indicates he had an appreciation of the circumstances of the assault at the time.

Husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons. One of them was the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work. Wife filed a motion to vary the November spousal maintenance order in light of hisbankrupt financial situation. HELD: 1)The respondent was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division of the property. 2)The petitioner paid $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claimed this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 3)Division based on asset values at this stage problematical. The petitioner required income to live on and the barley fell into that category. He paid one half of the net proceeds to his wife which covered the maintenance payments ordered for November, December, January and $300 of the $1,100 payment which came due on February 1. He was now in arrears $4,100. 4)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $5,975 for cattle squeeze sold at $9,000 for a total of $8,682. 5)Discretion was granted on the basis of the value of the respondent's assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings.  6)Allowing the wife's claim for set-offs, that there was no doubt he used assets to revive the farm income and that it was a viable farm operation which he wished to continue. The court reviewed the assets of each party and awarded the respondent the same privilege as the respondent. 7)The court allowed the wife to have her share of the sale proceeds from the cattle squeeze sale which would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors under his bankruptcy. 8)Divisions were to be divided according to the values indicated by the evidence including the valuations determined by the trustee in bankruptcy."

The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing or in attempting to interfere with the lawful use and improvement of the plaintiff's premises. The defendants granted an order abridging the time for service and return of the notice of motion and permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the trial of the action. The injunction was granted on the basis of the following grounds: 1) that the picketing was lawful in the sense that it was merely peaceful picketing for the purpose only of communicating information; 2) that there was no question that picketing took place at the entrance to the construction site adjacent to the pollution control plant and that those trucks had been delayed by the presence of a picket line; and 3) that in some cases the picketers had used baseball bats to the effect that they were trying to intimidate and frighten the opposing employees. HELD: The plaintiff's application was granted. 1)The defendants were ordered to pay costs.  2)The plaintiff was ordered to file materials respecting the actions of the defendants. 3)The picketing continued even if the defendants were granted an adjournment as requested. 4)The court was unable to find a clear and unequivocal precedent for the principle in any of the numerous decisions at all relevant to the question, to be found in Canada."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were found not guilty of any of the offences listed in the charges. 2) There was no evidence that the defendants, or anyone who wished to do anything on a public reserve, could have done so under the possible authority of the Department of Municipal Affairs. 3) The evidence did not support the charge that they were breaking the law. It was plain the defendants did not have the legal right to do what they wished with the land. 4) There were no breaches of the plaintiff's rights under either s. 197(b) or s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Public Reserve Act. 5) The plaintiff had a boathouse built on the public reserve in front of his cottage lot. He complained to the provincial department of planning and development about the structure of the reserve. The department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 6) The defendant was found guilty of trespass to public reserve land. The defendant's claim for costs was dismissed. 7) The court found that the defendant was entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000 to the plaintiff for his costs of preparing the complaint. 8) In the circumstances, the defendant had chosen not to prosecute the plaintiff as a landowner, but rather because the costs were borne by the plaintiff in this case. Nine months after the plaintiff filed the complaint, the municipality did not act. The plaintiff was ordered to pay $2,000 in costs."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable.","The appellants appealed a decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court ordering a new trial on seven counts against them under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act and (failing) to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused.

(1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 (SK CA), [1982] W.W.R. 249. 2) The appeal judge misinterpreted his decision. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus, there is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payment of taxes or whether there was any intent to make a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. The bookkeeping was haphazard and sloppy."

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The trial judge found that the respondent did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(the P.P.S.A.) and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s.30(2). The Credit Union appeals this decision. HELD: The issue is reduced to whether the respondent authorized the sale. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The Court of Appeal relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., a case that the trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It follows that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest. It is not necessary for the appellant to find priorities as between the parties. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. In this case the respondent concluded that the Lanson didn't authorize the Sale of the Mobile Home (the mobile home had been sold and attempted to seize it). At trial the Court of Queen's Bench judge concluded that Mr. Justice Krueger concluded Lanson did not authorization the sale (i.e., authorized the Sale). Lanson's security interest continues and takes priority over the security Interest of the Credit union. The Credit union appeals. Issues: 1) The issue of priority is reduced on whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized the sales. He clearly gave the secured creditor (Lanson) an express authority to deal. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay a secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyers. The appellant relied heavily upon Canadian commercial Bank. 2) It is unnecessary for the Appellate Court to have jurisdiction over the claim for priority issue in a case such as Battleford. 3) The Appeal Court judge found in favour of the appellant based on s.29(6) of the PPSA.

Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA warrant applications with respect to the baby and its mother refer to a blood sample obtained from a confidential source (without naming the confidential source) but the means of testing the reliability of same must be afforded to the justice. If this is not done, it will ordinarily be impossible for the justice to be satisfied that reasonable grounds exist. The court was of the view that a DNA warrant application would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. Given the natural mother's allegation as to the birth father of the 19 year old and the latter's denial of her paternity, the information, if any, contained in the Registration of Live Birth concerning the Birth father would be of assistance in providing a complete picture to the court."
9_2003skqb459.txt,"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest. At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession with intent to distribute marijuana in the presence of a person under the age of 21. The evidence was excluded from the search because it did not raise any symptoms of impairment. HELD: The Court found that the accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed and that all evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). The Court rejected the defence argument that it should not believe the accused when he stated that he saw green material in the complainant's purse because he did not enter that in any of the four documents he prepared in connection with the investigation. The Court distinguished between s. 7 and s. 24 of the Charter. It held that during the course of highway traffic stop the police are authorized to make certain inquiries and need not turn blind eye to matters which legitimately raise their suspicions. The strong odour of marijuana seen emanating from the interior of the vehicle gave the Court the impression that it was marijuana. The accused was in the back seat of her vehicle and screaming and crying. The police observed that the vehicle was cluttered with blankets and there was a small child in the driver's seat covered with a blanket. The cracked tail light caused the smell of marijuana to radiate out from under the hood of the accused vehicle. The child was crying and she was screaming. The Crown did not require the accused to avert her eyes from any evidence of activity, whether criminal or otherwise, that could be observed by any vigilant member of the public. Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during their course of their duties. This is particularly true in light of the current state of affairs in the province."
9_2004nssf51.txt,"After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material. The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise. The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant. The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","The petitioner received a letter in which he stated that he was not served with the Applicant's application and supporting material. The court had previously received from the applicant that he had until the 23rd of April 2004 to contact the petitioner. The petitioner returned the Court's calls but was not able to return the calls. The Court made numerous telephone calls to the petitioner's office from the Courtroom and on several occasions left messages on the respondent's telephone and messages on his behalf. HELD: The petitioner is entitled to additional costs in the sum of $250 for a total of $550.00, inclusive of disbursements.  1) The petitioner received adequate notice of the hearing and was not made available for cross examination. His affidavit is struck. 2) Because he did not make himself available for the telephone conference and was unable to appear for cross- examination, his Affidavit is struck as invalid. 3) The Court is also adding costs for the costs of preparing the court's calls (which continued at approximately 5 minute intervals up to and including 2:50 p.m.)."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders of the Board made in May 2004 and June 2004. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The Board has conceded that two exceptions to the general rule apply. The first is that it has no jurisdiction to issue subpoenas or make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced. The second is that the Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record.  1) There are virtually no reasons given by the Board for why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW other than to say that it is seeking documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was without jurisdiction to do so. 2) The Board acknowledged that the error of law must appear on the face of the Record and that the rule should not be relied upon to thwart meaningful judicial review in appropriate cases. It is not in dispute that the case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The Court will consider the issue of whether the question to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal, Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 778 (SCC), [1998] S.C.R. 982. 3) It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy requirement for documents. These portions would normally have been struck. However, the Board did not address these provisions in its decision. It declined to comment on them. 4) The application for discovery and document production is allowed in the first instance pursuant to s. 24 of Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.; 1978, c. T-17, unconstitutional and of no force and effect insofar as it infringes the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Trade Union and s. 3(c) of Canada. 5) The portions of a transcript are attached as Schedule C to this judgment."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended, contending that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, and by rejecting in total the evidence of only one Crown witness, a police officer, and three other civilian witnesses. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; there was insufficient evidence to prove that the appellant was in fact the driver of the vehicle; and other grounds as may appear from the record. The scope of the appellate review in summary conviction appeal is well settled. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. It remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable. The Crown has established a prima facie case, having proved all the elements of the offence necessary for conviction, and on the basis of the acceptable evidence heard, is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused in this matter."
9_2008skpc147.txt,"The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties to this action signed handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: Contract between the parties is to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm. The plaintiff did not have a copy of the final invoice given to him and he, Dobson, did not bring copy of that bill with him to Court. Because the parties are so close in their estimate of the amount of final cost of the feed, the court cannot accurately determine whether the figure should be $800 or $900. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $850 to the defendant. 1) The parties did not reach an essential consensus on the issue of the pay-off of the first year's feed which was essential to enforce the second year's agreement. This agreement was never enforceable except for the partial success of the claim.  2) The plaintiff was not entitled to the sum originally owed to him except for an essential adjustment in the balance of the balance. This was not an essential agreement which could have resulted in the plaintiff paying an essential sum for the failure of the parties to reach an agreement where they agreed that an eight-figure sum was owed to the plaintiff. This sum has not been reached and the plaintiff cannot enforce it except in the term of this case. This case has been largely successful in that no agreement has been reached as to the actual amount owed. 3) Each party was to submit an invoice for any costs associated with the above conditions. The defendant shall pay the plaintiff $850 for the outstanding balance."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert (the 'City') with certain conditions. Although the demolition order was dated November 18, 2004, legal proceedings have extended the life of the building. The building was at the time of the respondent's demolition. The respondent sought and was granted an adjournment to prepare his appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed on all grounds. The board's order was confirmed and the respondent was granted a period of 6 months from July 2009 to bring forth his written proposal. The appeal court found that both the board's decision to confirm the demolition and to demolish was appropriate and continues to be appropriate. The Board was also asked to extend the suspension of enforcement of the order by six months to allow the respondent to reply to the second appeal. 1)The appeal court judge found that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide on the basis of law or jurisdiction. The fact that the respondent had not disclosed any of the police files relevant to the appeal until now did not disqualify him from pursuing other avenues including an application to the Court for subpoena or other Order directing production of documents. 2)The Board was given an opportunity to reconsider its decision. It was not appropriate to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they considered relevant. It would be unfair to the respondent in failing to act in the circumstances of this appeal. 3)The respondent knew the case he had to meet and acted accordingly. There was no error of law on this ground."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.",The applicant appealed the decision of the Chambers judge dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The applicant's grounds of appeal were not questions of estoppel or collateral attack as they were not in issue. The Chambers judge’s decision was based on the principles of fairness and was not the same as that of the Supreme Court of Canada in Sagon.
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused, accused, is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent? The evidence of the defence witnesses raises reasonable doubt about the respondent's non-consent."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count one.  1) The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The Court found little if any evidence to support the charge. The observations that the officer makes from engaging the accused in conversation at the door are very similar to the ones that the accused made in the Rogers case. 2) There was no evidence of driving at all. The accused walked to her vehicle carrying a small child put the child in the car seat in the backseat and drove away. The officer did not ask the person to open the door. There was a very young child present. The interactions were serious. The implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit 'convenient communication with the occupant of the dwelling' (at 18). The Court reviewed various authorities from the Supreme Court of Canada and concluded that the unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 and 8 was serious. It affected the accused”s privacy, liberty, and human dignity. 3) With regard to the voir dire, the Court found the accused not guilty of impaired driving on count two. The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and it was found to be reasonable on a balance of probabilities. The Police officer”determined that she had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for impaired driving, even if they did so with the intention of gathering evidence about the state of an occupant” (as determined by the court in the dissenting opinion). 4) On the count two count of excluding evidence from the trial, the evidence will be excluded.  5) It was found with respect to the constitutional provisions that require a warrant to enter a dwelling house for the purpose of securing evidence for an impaired driving offence, but not to permit that evidence to be obtained at the time of the breach. The court found nothing in the jurisprudence extending the principles articulated by the majority in that decision as far as Crown counsel."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The parties were involved in a spousa relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband has children from a prior relationship for whom he pays support. During the relationship the wife suffered from health problems which resulted in her becoming disabled and unable to continue her employment. During this time the husband secured full-time employment with CN. The wife has resided with extended family members, most recently her mother, with the result that she has no costs for housing. Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each former spouse in the immediate post-separation period, and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in affordability of lifestyles of the former spouses, spousousal Support is the appropriate mechanism to diminish those disparities. 2) The net assets for distribution are not far exceed the amount requested. In addition, the wife has made no adjustment for the husband's child support obligations nor the fact that he is supporting a minor child in his care.

At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant. Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.","This was an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 346 and for an ORDER setting aside allgarnishee summonses issued pursuant to Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee as well as a letter of understanding between the applicant and the union that employees would notify the company if they were to be absent from work due to illness or other reason. The respondent took the position that the Mutual Agreement was a last chance agreement. Based on this agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The patently unreasonable test is absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The penalty imposed on the respondent was not discharge."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The court answered the question as to the causation of the plaintiffs injuries.  1)Did the collision cause or contribute to any ofthe plaintiff's injuries or damage? 2)Had the defendant been a medical doctor, he would have been qualified to diagnose injuries. The court would have found the defendant to be a qualified expert in the field of biomechanics. 3)The court was not prepared to accept the evidence of either expert. The expert was not qualified to give an opinion as to causation of injury in the human spine because his research appears to be limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports which may have been prepared by researchers having limited knowledge of human anatomy."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. This is because the debt at the time fixed for payment is conditional upon the vendors being able to make title, and where he has no title the purchase-money never becomes payable. This argument mixes two different streams of the law of garnishment: the law pertaining to 'conditional debts' and that dealing with the garnishment of notes."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month together with renewal compensation calculated using the average renewals for the prior two quarters. The contract provided for a two year period in which the compensation would be calculated pro-rated in accordance with the number of renewals received. The termination of the sales agent's contract provided that he would receive no less than $1,800 per month for the first two years of his employment, as well as support from his former employer for the next two years. Awarding the plaintiff 20 months salary, that his course of conduct was not unreasonable and did not constitute a failure by the plaintiff to mitigate his damages. 2. What is reasonable notice to which dismissed employee is entitled? The factors cited in Bardal v. Globe Mail Ltd. (1960), 1960 CanLII 294 are often cited as factors in deciding the period of reasonable notice. In this case, the issue was whether the terminated employee had made reasonable efforts to seek alternative employment. The evidence showed that Grant did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment. Rather, he prepared neither a resume nor sought a recommendation from former employer in order to assist him in such pursuit."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preservingand detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)The applicants failed to meet the first test of prima facie case, irreparable harm. 2)The court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do, and set forth with some particularity in the brief filed by PetroCan. It is acknowledged that ss.22(2)(a) and (b) of the BLA expands the lien rights contained in ss. 22(1) to prevent the continuance or recurrence of wrongful acts. However, this test goes much further than the 'prima facie', or strong, case that must be proven in a negative injunction application. In the case before the court the applicants must prove a very strong probability that grave damage will accrue to him in the future. 3)If the plaintiffs' application is successful and the order sought is granted, the applicants would be required to pay full compensation to the defendants pursuant to Rule 390 of the Queen's Bench Rules. 4)The Court failed to consider the relative strength of the applicants case (that being their entitlement to compensation based upon the liens registered by them) when those liens are not before the Court."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages for damages arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff had leased a vehicle from the defendant, Christian Ruhr, pursuant to a standard lease agreement. After the accident, the plaintiff took the vehicle to Saskatchewan Government Insurance for repairs. During the repairs, damage to the vehicle's exhaust system was assessed. SGI deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'. The claim was allowed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. HELD: An express election is not necessary. If SGI elected to repair the vehicle, it will be liable for the entire cost of the repair, whether it exceeds the limits in statutory condition 8(4) or 8(2). An election to reinstate is not an election. The statutory scheme is clear. The fact that SGI did not expressly notify the plaintiff, nor Crestview, that they intend to exercise their option, effectively increases the insurer's liability for the damage. It is an election under a statutory condition. In this case, SGI took no notice of the alternative claim for reinstatement, but simply paid the full cost to the repair shop."
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and the separate Statement of Defence of Helen Rilkoff. The issues raised in the statements of defence were not susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis and neither did the issues in the counterclaim show a reasonable cause of action.

She appeared to have an interest in the equity redemption.  3)The pre-trial motions filed by the defendants were frivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. 4)The Court refused to expend time and effort resolving these rather serious questions. It was also noted that the preconditions for hearing applications pursuant to Rule 188 are quite different to those relating to Rule 173 in that an application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justiciable dispute is revealed.

b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff, who delivered her daughter by caesarian section, was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital as a result of a sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. She was subsequently hospitalized by ambulance, where she appeared to be improving as well as could be expected despite extensive blood loss. The defendant had performed a successful hysterectomy. The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were that the likely cause of the bleeding was retained products of conception. The medical evidence conflicted as to whether or not the defendant actually performed the D & C, a procedure which the plaintiff alleges would have remedied the haemorrhaging which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing thehysterectoromy. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery.  1)The Court held that it did not believe that the specific determination of that point would affect or change the resolution of the causation issue. 2)There was no evidence to suggest that the operating room nurses' notes were fabrications of something that did not happen. The doctors were not called to explore any possibility of error. The report of operation was realistic and reasonable. 3)Although the plaintiff had the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the defendant failed to perform C, it was her responsibility to prove on a prima facie proof of the facts stated therein in Ares v. Venner. The Court adopted the reasoning in Ares (1970), 1970 CanLII (SCC), 73 W.W.R. 347, and held that the Court's conclusions must be based on a reasonable standard of care. 4)The court found that the surgical procedure was not the most appropriate in the circumstances. The surgical care provided by the defendant was not in line with the standard accepted by most medical experts. 5)Given the advanced stage of the necrosis and degree of deterioration it is readily apparent that the condition had been in existence for some time. It was also found, in the opinion of two other qualified obstetricians and gynaecologists, that having the maker of the hearsay statement available for cross-examination is not prerequisite to a statement being admissible. 6)It was the position of the plaintiff that the continuation or recurrence of bleeding after September 1992 was caused by the failure of the surgical staff to remove the remaining blood from the uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The primary issue on this appeal was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. In the circumstances, either party may apply to a youth court judge for an order under s. 16 of the Act to decide the proper forum to hear the charges. 1) The Court reviewed the factors set out in R. v. A.(E.A.) and found that there was no evidence on which he could find the accused guilty. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Young Offenders Act and in particular s.79(4) of the former Juvenile Delinquents Act which permitted judges to initiate transfer applications of their own initiative. It would appear there are no adverse consequences from such an order. 2) The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge was not required to assume jurisdiction over the transfer of the matter. Rather, he was required to consider the competing interests of society, the accused's background and any record of previous findings of delinquency under the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, or previous evidence of guilt under that statute."

Defendant awarded costs to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff's claim was dismissed due to conflicting evidence as to whether there was an unusual danger on the premises, if the door threshold was not adequate, and if so, whether the defendant used reasonable care to prevent damage to the plaintiff's health and safety and whether the plaintiff used his own part for his own safety."

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order for the payment of child support.

HELD: 1)The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The principles of law governing child support for infant children are well-known and specifically provided in The Guidelines and The Act. 2)Both parties are restrained from removing the children from the Province of Saskatchewan without the written consent of the other party or an order of this Court. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  3)The total annual income of the respondent was $22,993.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.

It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.

It was permitted by the hospital that this obligation could be performed by a fellow doctor having privileges in the hospital but the obligation itself always remained with each individual doctor. 2)There was no evidence either in fact or in law supporting the existence of a trust/fiduciary relationship between the doctors or the defendant. 3)Discretion was exercised by the doctors not to enter into an arrangement which compromised the hospital's statutory and contractual obligations to deliver the patient care to the hospital. 4)The court dismissed the action against the doctor who had refused to attend upon him or her for several days because he was a party to the arrangement.  5)The common characteristics of a relationship between a class or category or of such nature in fact as to have given rise to one of them were discussed by Cameron J.A. in Baskerville v. Thurgood, 1992 CanLII 8313 (SK CA), [1992] W.W.R. 193 (Sask. C.A.) at 203: As the judgments in LAC Minerals, supra, suggest, actions founded in breach of fiduciaries fall to be determined along these lines: (1)Was the relationship between all the medical practitioners having privileges to practise in a hospital to be on- call to answer the needs of patients admitted by him or herself on a continuous basis, 24 hour day and 7 days week, and to respond to emergencies; (2)The relationship between doctors and the hospital was not defined by the legislation; and (3)No breach giving rise to an action for damages was found."

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,FIAT: The applicant applies for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The only other claimant who had been asked by management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case are standing by pending a judgment whereby they will be able to measure the success or failure of their claims. HELD: The order of severance sought by the plaintiff was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial.  1)The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by the counsel for the Canada government if the issues are severed are groundless. 2)It was in the best interests of justice to have the order granted so the issue could proceed only from the litigation of the issues with respect to the third parties. 3)The plaintiff was stung by the delay in the pursuit of resolving the issues. It would be a very lengthy period of time. 4)The applicant was pushed to the forefront of the effort to resolve the issues (except for minor matters) which were of no concern to him.
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is attending university. HELD: 1) In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for support of the petitioner during the months of September to December. This would be logical conclusion that Table support is not intended to cover all of the respondent's personal expenses. 2) Both children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act are expected to contribute to their own support to the extent reasonably possible before looking to their parents and their exceptional legal obligation to continue to provide support while adult children attend university and are, for that reason alone, unable to get by on their own. 3) The Table amount of support for children does not increase with their age. There is no doubt that the needs of the children are significantly different from an elementary school student's needs. It is logical conclusion, therefore, to award the amount prescribed by the applicable Table. 4) The petitioner's income in 2000 and 2001 was expended on his own living expenses and any part-time income that the children may have will reduce their entitlement to a living allowance under their student loans. 5) The respondent's annual income in 2001 was $18,000 per annum. He is paying Table support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans for the period July to December 2001.  6) Costs in the family amount are $1,153 per month based upon the respondent earning $96,300. The Court was satisfied that the chamber judge misapplied s. 3(2) of the Guidelines by failing to have resort to the provisions of s3(2)(b)."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claimed that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. He claims that its predecessor, the Trimark mutual fund, was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as a result of the defendant's negligence. He shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the Date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed. The claim against the defendant is dismissed. Given that the defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant, no evidence was led against it and the claim against it was dismissed. Although the disappointed beneficiary principle has usually arisen and may well usually arise in the context of solicitors and will preparation, this “disappointed beneficiary” principle is not function merely of a defendant’s occupation. In Esser v. Brown, 2003 BCSC 246 (CanLII), (2003), 223 D.L.R. (4th) 560, the British Columbia Court of Appeal saw as analogous to the role of the solicitor, that of notary public who ought reasonably to have contemplated that carelessness would cause harm to a third party. See also: Burnett v. Took Engineering Inc., 2000 BCSC 1630, [2000] B.C.J. No. 2302. [19] Nordstrom was professional who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to Mayer was provided in the course of his business. The mutual fund had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of Mayer's intent to benefit Garry Mayer was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by Nordstrom are frequently used as estate planning tools why else would there be beneficiary designation? The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the third party, the applicant, would bear the loss. To this case, the situation is analogous to that which occurred in Wilhelm v. Hickson, (2005), 189 Sask. R. 71 (C.A.)."
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff, who had been injured in a motor vehicle accident, applied to set aside the jury notice filed by the defendant and his wife, who died shortly after the plaintiff's treatment. Awarding the plaintiff $2,500, that the jury will not be able to understand the complexity of the evidence and will need to further consider the effect of her death on the action before taking any steps in response to this information.

b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The golf course was operated for approximately 10 years without any residential development adjacent to it. In 1997, the defendant, which was then owner, entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to open up the land beside the Golf Course for residential development. The plaintiff contended that the golf balls which were hit from the adjacent golf course onto their property were and continue to be an interference with the use and enjoyment of their property. HELD: The Court held that few golf balls of 10-20 over a 5-year period with limited damage to property did not constitute continuing nuisance. The defendants were liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  1) The plaintiffs were awarded injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years.  2) The Court refused to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem. The Court ordered that the plaintiffs not be permitted to use their lawns or play their golf balls on the property for any length of time. 3) The plaintiff was ordered to pay costs to the defendant in the amount of $6,000 to resolve the litigation.  4) The defendants refused to accept the recommendations in the Optionee's Indemnity Clause as contained in s. 2.12 of the Option Agreement between Great Plains and Parkview Homes Ltd., which was later assigned to the defendants. 5) As the plaintiffs were not parties to the original agreement, they were not bound by the wording in that clause. They were ordered to enter into an indemnity clause with the defendants that resolved the litigation by allowing them to operate their golf course in a manner that caused the errant golf balls to enter their lawn.  6) The defendant was to be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiffs for those special damages as set out in the affidavits filed pursuant to s. 952(g) of the Order of the Court.  7) In addition, the defendants were to be separately liable for any damages that arose from the litigation relating to the plaintiff and the defendant optionor. 8"
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence following his conviction in Traffic Safety Court for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's. 66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations'. The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. As result, the appeal must be allowed and the charge declared void because it does not charge an offence known to law. The Certificate of offence, form of the Summary Offences Procedure Regulations, 1991 permits a person, to whom a ticket is issued, to accept responsibility by making voluntary payment in the prescribed amount in certain cases. There does not appear to be the legislative authority for the utilization of voluntary payment for an alleged violation of operating a motor vehicle on a public highway which has after-market tinted side windows regardless of the way the charge was framed. HELD: The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is quashed. 1) The count is a nullity and is void ab initio.  2) It is not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect. It is the standard procedure in Criminal Law that a conviction based upon defective information ought not be found to be nullity. 3) The Crown did not provide proper notice of the alleged offence or the sufficiency of its charge. The Crown was given an opportunity to address the issue of sufficiency.  4) With regard to the appeal, the count cannot be amended so that there is a miscarriage of justice."

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of the aggravated assault on the complainant and in the information, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertakings. The Court also found that the accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which takes him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was acquitted of both counts of assault on a police officer. The court considered the totality of the evidence without any reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt on count 1. No evidence was offered to contradict any Crown evidence and the evidence considered left the Court convinced beyond a reasonable doubt."

He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed.

The court ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation with regard to the election of the members of the Board with a view to determining the voting rights of the commercial owners. It found that principles of contract interpretation had no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of a condominium bylaw. As there were only seven positions on the Board, a vote was required. The commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three persons for election to the Board and the board members were not entitled to vote separately as a class to determine their nominees.

b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor.  They sought to have the actions heard together on the basis that they were former clients of the defendant RBC, having held investment accounts during certain periods of time. The investment advisor personally responsible for the accounts was Mr. Bagnell. The actions brought against the defendant were identical, raising the same issues as they did in each action. Each plaintiff alleged that the defendant negligently managed their accounts, and all were seeking the same type of financial damages, along with punitive and exemplary damages. The defendants were found to be the employers of both men. As the plaintiffs indicated that they intended to proceed by way of jury, so too did the motion. The motion was dismissed.  1)It is not possible at this juncture to determine the degree of commonality, in what the pleadings disclose as being four relatively complex actions. 2)The Court relies upon the principles outlined in Stone v. Confederation Life Insurance Co. (1993), 117 N.S.R. (2d) 194. 3)There is little evidence before the Court as to how similar, and potentially duplicitous, evidence at four separate trials will be. 4)The pleadings and submissions of Counsel do not appear to have sufficient commonality regarding the nature of evidence intended to be called at trial. Rather, they suggest that experts will be called in relation to each action, to assist the Court in fully appreciating just how similar the issues to be dealt with in common, among the actions, and in the context of these matters. In any event, the Court will be at the forefront of this effort. 5)In terms of trials, there should be a broad approach to assessing motion for consolidation. The Court can proceed to the alternative remedies sought, namely that the matters be heard together or in sequence.  6)The Rule 37.02(c) of the Judicature Act is intended to allow the Court to consider the application of well established legal principles to uncertain facts. The decision to make consolidation is necessarily discretionary, and particularly difficult to justify to a rigorous standard, because the judge is asked to predict the timing and context of not just one, but two previously separate proceedings, and compare the consequences of such an outcome to that of the other actions.

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the city had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence.

The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal. Recognition of a discount for tax on RRSPs was explicit in the wife's pre-trial calculations, in her calculations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter. If the wife had laid out discounted values for the RRSP, she would have been required to pay $5,000 cash and $100,000 in RRSP rollover to satisfy the trial date. 2) The wife is entitled to $105,000 of the family property. 3) The parties were urged to try and resolve the matter themselves. They were unable to do so and four months later the application was returned to chambers. 4) The dispute arises because the wife claims she is entitled $105k in cash or cash equivalents with at least $65,000 being the cash composition. She says this is what the husband said he could borrow. She was not aware the husband had significant RRSP's. 5) The husband argues that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSP to adjust for tax implications. He argues that RRSP assets should be significantly discounted to reduced after tax cash value as at the date of division. The petitioner shall have judgment as against the respondent in this amount. Should the respondent choose to rollover RRSP monies, the amount of RRSP funds to be transferred must be increased by a factor of 1.3. This is to account for the taxable nature of the funds and for the remaining family debts. The parties cannot hide behind restrictive and literal interpretation to circumvent the order and make mockery out of the administration of justice."
b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the assault because of the way he treated her. She also alleged that he touched her inappropriately and that she no longer felt the same way about him. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. The Court found that the credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D. could be made to the jury. It is entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by applying the incorrect mens rea and actus reus to the offence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. In this view, the Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). The jurisprudence currently recognizes four situations: an error of law, a mistake of fact for which there is no evidence, an assessment of evidence based on the wrong legal principle (e.g. a wrong law); an error in fact of fact (i.e. a failure to consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence); a trial judge's failure to act in a manner that would have accorded the accused with a material bearing on his acquittal; and an honest and complete failure to provide the court with the necessary information to properly process and apply the evidence. The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the dangerous driving."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s.35.1. The Director's application was not statute barred and there was no limitations issue.  1)The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is an in rem remedy. It provides that the person does not have to be charged with a criminal offence for the Director to pursue civil remedies under this statute. The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. 2)The language employed by the Director is preceded by the words 'Notwithstanding the Limitations Act'. These words are not superfluous. They operate as preface to the rule itself and as such hold interpretative significance. Under both regimes the terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in the same manner. The term 'property obtained in connection with a specific unlawful act' has never been challenged. The present case may seem akin to the second instance but think the true view is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 legislation thus the Director's authority to pursue the forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. The 2009 Act did not change the state of the law or Mr. Butler's rights from what it was before the new law came into effect. In fact, it was a transitional period.  3)There is no evidence that any of the individuals present at the time of the search were there to purchase drugs of any sort. The current legislative mandate reflected in the2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. 4)The Court accepts the Director as an expert qualified to express an opinion in the area of controlled drugs and substances, trafficking in controlled drugs or amending the CDSA. Both statutes contemplate an application to the Court for forfeiture of such property. Both apply the same legal test and standard of proof. There is no obvious or identified unfairness attached to the legislative change in relation to the triggering events or definitions, nor to the ultimate consequence."
c_1992canlii4474.txt,"This was an application for an order prohibiting the law firm that represented the respondent bank from acting as counsel for the trustee of the bankrupt company's estate. The applicant argued that there were significant areas where the interests of the bank conflicted with interests of the creditors. The trustee, who must act in the best interest of all creditors, should not be advised by the bank's counsel. Granting the order. The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application by the applicant for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be creditor of that bankrupt. This conflict of interest demanded the removal of the present counsel. The respondent acknowledged that there are areas of potential conflict with the interests of both the Bank and Trustee, but argued that to order the trustee to retain other counsel would create a great financial burden because of the time required by new counsel to acquaint itself with information already in the knowledge of present counsel.(1)The Trustee was to present the applicant with full particulars of the claim including copies of relevant documents.  2)The applicant was not seeking independent legal advice. Rather, he was seeking the advice of his former law firm which represented the Bank in its dealings with the bankrupt estate.  3)The conduct of the Bank's solicitors was not a practical solution as it was not an appropriate forum for the applicants.  4)A clear distinction must be drawn between the duties and obligations of a receiver manager appointed under the terms of a debenture and one appointed by a court. In the latter case, the authority of the receiver-manager is derived from the court and not the instrument. To so decide would mean that any shareholder of bankrupt need only commence a spurious law suit in order to cause financial hardship to the petitioning creditor or generally to disrupt bankruptcy proceedings. This type of litigation is so blatant that the Court must consider whether the Bank should not be in a position where it could even appear to be influenced by the bank in making that decision."

c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated at the second knuckle. The Court assessed the plaintiff's damages for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities at $10,000. 1)The non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated and the court concluded that an ordinary user of paint sprayers should be aware of the danger at the nozzle. 2)The plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of inflation for all the years 1989 to 1994 because there was noexcuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for six years. Had the claim been adjudicated in timely fashion, only a few years of inflation would have intervened. 3)The court found that the defendant's waiver was ineffective. The plaintiff had no reason to be scrupulously careful about the position of his finger because he was unaware of the risk. 4)The defendant was awarded judgment for $18,789.5 plus costs and pre-judgment interest."

c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1994. There were two children of the marriage, Chad, born in 1976 and 1978. The parties were engaged throughout the marriage and had two children, Chad and Ryan. Chad was in high school and was dependant on the mother. Through the circumstances of the debts and Scott's bankruptcy, the mother had been employed as a nurse but had not retired. She was also an undischarged bankrupt. HELD: Spousal support was to be divided among the spouses. The only marital asset of any value was the husband's pension. It was not unusual in this family that one of the parents must carry out the primary parenting duties. However, as the boys got older and Scott became more involved as a parent, the retirement method was not acceptable to calculate the value of the pension. The wife was to pay child support of $260 per month for 12 months until Ryan was a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. Child support would be reduced by 30% due to a liquidity problem and the mother was required to make additional contributions. The court determined that the fairest way to divide the pension was to have the maximum amount of child support available be paid to the spouse immediately."

Further documentation would be required by a trial judge in determining the issue of thevalidity of the applicant's interest in the leases involved, including the matter of whether Home's lease violates the rule against perpetuities. Further clarification of the reasons for the continuance of the caveats was ordered.  1)There is a prima facie agreement in existence, and Home Oil is the valid successor of the interest of the Freeholders Oil Co. 2. Home Oil has failed to produce all necessary documents. 2)It is not conceded in this case that there is an agreement for sale in existence and the reasoning in the three decisions referred to is not applicable. The question is whether it is the caveator or the challenger that should be required to initiate an action. Home's application for further clarification was dismissed as there was no evidence that Home had an interest in establishing the agreement. 3)There may be a number of circumstances in applications under s.159 where established agreements are not in issue. Home may by summons call upon a caveator to attend before judge to show cause why the caveat should not be withdrawn. There has been no termination of any of the agreements by a process of rescission or cancellation or the like.

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order of a Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income.

Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute.

The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the Court should order a single psychiatric examination as it would be unwise to act on a single recommendation. HELD: The Court granted the application on the basis the competency examination had been obtained by the subterfuge and abuse of process used to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetent. The Court's process will not be offended should the litigation continue. A certificate of incompetence issued under the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed.
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children claimed that the accused had given him money to buy cattle. When the accused hung up the phone, the accused became so angry and his voice was so loud that he woke the baby granddaughter sleeping in the next room. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The accused was found guilty of uttering the threat. The Court held that there was no need for the accused to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. It was always open to the Accused to make Corbett applications and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In a non-jury trial, the Court should look charily at admitting such convictions or giving them any probative weight whatever. There is no need to draw a prima facie inference from the criminal record during a trial such as this one."
c_2000skca39.txt,"The appellants sought to admit fresh evidence. HELD: 1)A new trial was ordered. The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence. Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence. The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.  2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000. In default of payment the appellant's claim may be struck.","The appellants brought a motion to admit fresh evidence, which if allowed, mandates a new trial. HELD: The Court allowed the application. The strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson. Although the expert evidence of Mr. Jones was available, his counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants. The appellants also found that the proffered fresh evidence could have affected the result at trial, particularly with respect to the 'cause of the fire'."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT. An application was brought to determine the issue of costs reserved in 2001. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and could have handled the trial without difficulty. 2)The costs were reduced by 15 percent when failed claims for punitive and exemplary damages were treated as separate causes. 3)The medical report charge was not recoverable. 4)A great deal of the expert medical evidence introduced was of marginal value. The plaintiff was entitled to recover $1,000 of the fees paid for testimony and consultations but no part of the payment for the locum tenens or his medical report. 5)The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file medical practitioners' reports without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. Questions as to what effect pain disorder had on the plaintiff and when that pain disorder first occurred were major matters.  6)Profitable court costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. 7)Exorbitant fees may be recovered from the opposite party. 8)A second counsel fee is allowed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee. 9)Costs are in the discretion of the Court. A party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure that their testimony will assist the case is not deprived of costs. 10)A third party fee is not to be granted solely because that person is a senior member of the Bar. Counsel referred to the guidelines laid down in Electronic Superstore Ltd. v. Geransky Brothers Construction (1991), 90 Sask.R. 150 (Q.B.) for determining whether to allow all or part of expert witness fees in the event of a failure to comply with court directions.  10)Expert medical evidence expenses must be reasonable; the witness testimony contribution to the case and relevant to the issues are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the court. Counsel suggested that they are not adverse to having the Court provide some guidance. Counsel provided little assistance to the Court in relation to the time spent testifying."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court applied the principles in McKenzie to the evidence of credibility, while not necessarily believing the accused am left in reasonable doubt by it, as such the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The accused brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. He also sought an order pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under provisions of the Act, and particulars of the convictions. Crown counsel did not oppose the application. HELD: The application was denied. 1)A reasonably serene environment for trial is still possible in Saskatoon despite the fact that media reports regarding the use of knives and related acts of violence often referenced the victim and/or the incident giving rise to this trial. However, a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial. 2)Pre-trial publicity is not alone sufficient to suggest that a full, fair and impartial trial cannot be had. There are safeguards in our judicial system to prevent public bias from prejudicing an accused's right to a fair and unbiased trial. 3)The law accepts that jurors may enter the trial with biases. But the law presumes that jurors' views and biases will be cleansed by the trial process. It therefore does not permit a party to challenge their right to sit on the jury because of the existence of widespread bias alone."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which they object to produce by reason of claim of privilege. HELD: 1) The first order is for the defendant to provide the plaintiff with responses to two undertakings concerning the sale of cement.  2) The third parties are obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the defendant revises the position set forth in its initial response based on after acquired information, it may file the questions and objections with the local registrar in whose office the proceedings are pending.

c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The parties were married in 1976 and ceased living together around the end of 2001. After the separation, the child continued to live with his mother. In October 2007, the mother made an application under the Maintenance and Custody Act seeking retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. She sought an order that would provide: parenting provisions as to their son; child maintenance payable in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses and that the order would be retroactive to the date of their separation. The father argued that his expenses had been'sufficient notice' of his child support obligation that they had to be increased. Application granted; retroactive award granted in the amount of $687.00 for child maintenance that is in arrears with respect to ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008 and $9,833 for child support purposes. The mother's argument that she was pressured or intimidated by the father in order to delay her application to seek formalized child maintenance was not supported by the evidence. There was agreement as to the status of the child that his mother had made overtures to the father for increased child maintenance and that he had resisted such requests indicating lack of income to provide any additional amount. However, the father had 'effective notice' that his current payment was deficient and had not been made to the mother. He requested retroactive payments of child support to date more than three years before formal notice was given to him. HELD: The father's application for retroactive support was denied. The court ordered that the father have a responsibility to provide child maintenance to his daughter for the purposes of this proceeding and ordered that child maintenance payments be made beyond the three-year limitation period."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The Director argued that the Chambers judge had overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime and so forth. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not persuaded that, in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the attention of the Court."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s.23 of the Act and s.35(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. The children are identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: 1)Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b). As the first option, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is for each child to remain where they are on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the order being sought in these circumstances. 2)The Agency is taking the position that if the father has consented to a long-term order, he is not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable and nurturing environment."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the petitioner’s primary residence was in Moose Jaw and that it was imminent with the decision of where Madison would attend school. The court also held that it would defer to the court to determine where she would attend her public school graduation party and whether she should seek employment elsewhere. The respondent”s parents were divorced in November 2012. During his youth, the respondent moved about Saskatchewan with his parents, brothers and sister. They resided there for several years. They were married in 2009 and had two children, ages 11 and 12. The petitioner had one child, who was now four years old. The child was normal and resilient in coping with the parent” s separation and conflict. Although the respondent had some difficulties sustaining stable adult relationships, the court found that the child was able to come out of them well-adjusted and would be better off without the assistance of the mother. The mother was competent and loving. The father of the child who had been separated from the petitioner was found to be a very good father to the child. Although he was a good father, the Court noted that the father had not shown the child that she was capable of nurturing a relationship with the child and that she had not been exposed to domestic disharmony firsthand."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application is dismissed. SMI is obliged to defend the interests of the first defendants and is entitled to attempt to limit the liability of the plaintiffs. 2) There is no duty to third party insurer by SMI in this case. The court referred to a case called Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co. (2000), [2001] S.C.R. 595, where the Supreme Court of Canada dealt primarily with the question of the appropriateness of the award and amount of punitive damages. 3) The case for punitive damages is much the same as it is in the tort for profit situation, and may be justified on both retributive and deterrence grounds. 4) The plaintiffs make an application pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the former Queen's Bench Rules to have the claim against SMI struck in its entirety. The Court referred to another case, called Balsdon v. Red Seal Vacations (2011 SKCA 116), where the plaintiff submitted that because SMI was involved in this claim by virtue of its policy with them, it was entitled to seek damages for damages arising from that claim. 5) Each of the acts specified in the claim was done by the person or persons therein alleged on behalf of himself or themselves and their co-conspirators in furtherance of the said conspiracy to defraud."
c_2018skqb29.txt,HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance. It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not met the threshold obligation to satisfy the court that there was a material change in circumstance sufficient to support a variation application being made. The applicant was directed to apply for and agree to split the CPP credits between the applicant and the child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that the respondent would reapply for child support and spousal support if the child was disabled and unable to work. The respondent was to provide all information reasonably required by CPP to support her application and the applicant’s position was that she was prepared to pursue any variation application if it was not made.

If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial. 2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event. 3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence.","The appellant sought to overturn a conviction by the Provincial Court that he operated a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol and/or drugs contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code.

d_1997canlii11011.txt,"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody of the 7 year old daughter and the respondent would seek an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents and was doing well in the parenting role. She had discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture and allowing him to move back into the matrimonial home. She was not opposed to her leaving for Kelowna. 2)There was no legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, although her views were entitled to great respect. There was also no evidence that she raised any objection to his move. 3)The respondent was a good mother and there was nothing to dispute the close relationship between the two parents. 4)The applicant was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal from the community."

The matter was remitted back to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to its finding that the closure of the vacuum truck division was not a 'technological change' within s. 43(1)(c) of the Act.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

The accused sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached. Defence counsel took the position that at no point along the way did he waive delay and the delay of approximately 7 months which resulted from his desire to have a ruling made on the conflict of interest alleged was solely attributable to the Crown. The Crown did not share in the responsibility for this period of delay. Pre-charge delay was sufficient to raise the issue. There was no evidence as to why the accused's right to a fair trial had been affected by the delay.

The board held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal because the taxpayer failed to serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act.

In his affidavit he attached to his affidavit a letter in which he disagreed with any attempt to deny a hearing before the Board, taking the position the municipality was sufficiently notified by the Board of the appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the requirements for service contained in s. 63(6) do not go to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear a appeal from the Assessment Review Court. Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that a party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s.(63(6)) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions.

The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a hotel employee who had been employed for ten years as front desk manager for the Delta Sydney hotel. She filed a grievance alleging that her work hours were reduced because another employee with greater departmental seniority returned from maternity leave. The arbitrator found that the hotel seniority of the grievor had not been affected by the maternity leave; rather, she was the first employee to experience a reduction in work hours. The hotel applied for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision and sought to have it set aside under s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act. The appellant alleged that the wording of Article 9:01 can only be triggered where there is first finding that there has been an 'indefinite reduction of hours within department' and that the date of return is not clearly anticipated. She sought allotment of work hours based on her hotel and departmental position and recovery of her loss of loss of wages. The respondent denied this application and sought judicial review. The appeal was granted on the basis that the arbitrators decision was patently unreasonable and the decision was not reasonable. It was also found to be within the range of acceptable outcomes for an individual employee in a given department.

d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failure to provide a sample. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain a sample as his respiratory problems made it impossible for him to do so. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece. The accused's right to counsel was violated."

The respondent also sought a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. In the action, the respondent seeks to set aside the agreement made with the respondent and apply the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court had jurisdiction to vary the consent order under the circumstances as determined by the parties. There was no question that the respondent was entitled to commence her own divorce action in Nova Scotia. She was also entitled to seek division of property under the provisions of the Nova Scotia Divorce Act. Deliberations: 1) as agreed, there is no question the respondent's claim for divorce is entitled to the same relief as would have been accorded to the plaintiff in Welding v. Sanderson (supra). 2) However, there was a question of jurisdiction as the respondent had commenced her own separate action for division of the parties' assets. A consent order is a contract and must be treated as such. Under the terms of the agreement, it could only be set aside or varied by subsequent consent, or upon common mistake, misrepresentation or fraud, or on any other ground which would invalidate the contract. The proper forum was the Court of Appeal in Bank of N.S. v. Golden Forest Holdings (1990), 98 S.R.(2d) 429, which dealt with consent orders. 3) The respondent submits that she should have relied upon the equitable criteria set out in Schoen v. Rothbart (1987), 19 C.P.C. (1d) 48 (Ont. S.C.) (Ontario) for her submission regarding the equitable terms of a consent order.  4) It seems to me that the court has jurisdiction with respect to the jurisdiction of this matter, but that it must also have jurisdiction to deal with the precondition. Since the Ontario court order purported to finalize a property division between the parties, she is entitled, in the same action entitled, to vary, or vary a terms of its own order."

HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and to supply reasonable telephone access to the child for the remainder of the visits. 1)The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that they have been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits.

The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied for a remand for assessment pursuant to section 752.1 of the Code, as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the evidence concerning attempts which had been made to control the offender's behaviour in the community and the failure of an expert who testified to consider this when he gave his opinion. The matter was adjourned to permit an examination by an expert chosen by the defence. HELD: The Court held that it would be preferable to have the accused found a long-term offender because the evidence showed that the accused could manage to reduce the threat to an acceptable level by means of community supervision, including the prescribed conditions to which community supervision is subject and the additional conditions that may be imposed by the Parole Board. A review of the applicable law at the outset was held to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of the accused eventually being controlled by the community, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the code in 1997 which had the effect of making it more difficult for an offender to re-offend. The Court also considered whether there was a reasonable prospect of change in the course of his life, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender. The accused had three previous convictions, all of which related to domestic violence. The predicate offence was an extremely brutal aggravated assault which he caused irreversible brain damage to his sister. He had stomped on the victim's head, stomach and groin area and kicked him when he was lying on the floor gravely injured. Other convictions included robbery which involved him stabbing the victim in the thigh and assault with a weapon for spanking a six year old child with a shoe. In R. v. R.H.L. (2003), the Court of Appeal held that in order to achieve the goal of protection of the public under the dangerous offender provisions, there must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated within a reasonable period of time. This is especially true in cases where the offender does not suffer from an inherent defect of character or reason which may require an even higher degree of certainty in the evidence than the English version,'reasonable possibility'. The error in law found by the Court was the same in Lemaigre."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. In this action each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is here that Hayley was conceived. She was conceived after they began to cohabitate with their mother. She now attends Grade 1. The mother and father live in a duplex located on the Air Force base. Their hours of work are from 2:00 to 10:00 p.m. Each day they are in the apartment with their father. The father works three weeks straight and then returns to the apartment to take care of the child. He is currently employed as an aircraft mechanic. His annual income is $10,000 plus gratuities in this year's budget. 3) There is no evidence before the Court as to how much money the father has left in the bank or if he has any intention of returning to work in the near future. There is a possibility that he may be required to move to Alberta in order to receive specialized treatment for his daughter. If so, how much of that money will he have to spend on the child's education? 4) The father testified that he had no effective communications with either of the respondents, J. O. or C. H., and information is generally passed through his wife or through his own mother and on to himself."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs applied for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written interrogations; and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic. HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. An order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiffs to provide further and better particulars of their claim as set out in the Demand for Particulars dated November 28, 2005 and an additional order requiring them to provide additional particulars as well as undertaking responses.  1) The plaintiffs did not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages. Nor could it be said when assessing the merits of the considerable allegations that have been made that claim for aggravated and punitive damages is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious. 2) It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that it is plain and obvious pursuant to rule 173(a) of the Queen’s Bench Rules that the plaintiffs do not Have a Cause of Action. Rather, it is the position of the plaintiffs that they require particulars of reviews and inquiries in order to determine the level of skill of Dr. Graham in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. His performances both before and after the surgery performed on the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, they claim, are relevant to that issue.  3) The Court was limited to looking at the claim and particulars provided, if any, when deciding whether to strike paragraphs. 4) Counsel would not agree to allowing further examination. The plaintiffs were not required to reply to any undertakings or requests for further particulars.  5) The Rule 173(c) of The Queens Bench Rules allows a party to proceeding, without order, to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters in issue. Such an order would be contrary to the statute and violate the plaintiff's duty to provide the plaintiff with full particulars of the claim.  6) The claim was dismissed with costs."
d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred.

d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties never lived together. The petitioner went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the twins were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the birth of the twins. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to the petitioner's increased costs as a result of the shared parenting arrangement. However, there is some evidence that the petitioner has not met the onus upon him in this regard.  2) The petitioner seeks to have his child support payment as set out in the February 2, 2007 order be varied to provide that his $762 per month payment that he currently makes not be increased or decreased in the years to come. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that had been followed. 3) The requirement of material change in the situation of the child means that an application to vary custody cannot serve as an indirect route of appeal from the original custody order."

d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant applies at the top of the range of protections available to individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the young persons and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The Court is concerned that such disclosure would put both the physical and psychological well-being of the Students and their Families at further risk. HELD: 1) With respect to costs, the Court referred to Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] S.C.R. 835 (CanLII), [2001] and R. v. Mentuck (2001 SCC 76), to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and, the positive effects on the rights and interests of the parties and public, including the right to free expression. 2) Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine in this electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the youth persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them in the view of the Court. The public, who have the right, have the Right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of affidavits that speak to their effects of their assault on are sealed since there is a real and serious risk of further harm. 3) The affidavit of JR, now in Grade 9, were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students including the plaintiffs.

d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, the accused attempted to reach three different lawyers but ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1) Charter breaches were moderately serious. The Charter infringing conduct giving rise to the breaches was the officer's failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did. The accused was arbitrarily detained for that period of time and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. 2) The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body when he noticed slight slur in his speech led the Court to conclude an unreasonable and unnecessary delay occurred in making the demand. In those circumstances, the Court concluded the demand was not made forthwith."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. However, the Crown suggests that the Crown required special qualifications that would justify his opinion. 2) The trial judge accepted the accused's evidence that it was a decorative copy of a samurai sword. He also accepted that the blade of the sword was blunt. While the edges could be sharpened, it would take some time. 3) There is nothing to show that the knife was designed to be used as a weapon. When it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other jackknife; in order to open it, two hands must be used; the locking device renders the knife safer when it is used for peaceful purposes."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.

The Administrative Judge found that both parties agreed that there was a need for one comprehensive database for the purpose of verifying the applicants' fees and disbursements. The applicant applies to have leave denied. Leave to appeal denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verificationprocess along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendant, who was new to Canada and reliant upon the plaintiff for their employment and housing, had filed a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. The issue of damages is whether the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned to a date determined by the parties and the Court. HELD: 1) The plaintiff is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the Record of Employment for Lilia. 2) There is actually no loan given to Lilia as far as she worked 8 days and never received the cheque for her hours or vacation pay. It is not known at this time what the amount of damages Lilia might have incurred if she had now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. If she is unable to obtain the payments that she has lost, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.  3) The amount of the damages is unknown. As the defendant could now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from service Canada, there may be no damages incurred by the defendant if she now qualifies. 4) Lilia is not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the $5k,000 was a loan, as there's no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation.  5) The defendant claims back $2,400, which was paid for wages but it does not show up as wages or an advance of wages. There is no documentation if it is simply a gift to assist the defendants to start their new life in Canada. The plaintiff as well could have received a verbal loan with the defendants.  6) As there is no evidence that Lilia ever asked Lilia to pay back any of the money that she received in November, December and January, the statement of claim is dismissed.  7) It would be a mixed success if Lilia could obtain the funds that she had lost and there if no evidence to support that the refund of these monies was not by agreement by Lilia, there is nothing to show that the plaintiff gave her money to do so.  8) The payback of the loan as shown on the plaintiff's records do not show a cheque payable from the defendant's wages.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and wilfully failed to comply with a youth probation order by failing to attend a youth court session. The accused had been in La Ronge for three months prior to this trial and had sold cocaine to undercover officers for $4,250. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record the accused was not subject to custody under either sections 39(3)(a), (b) or (c). The Court also placed the accused on a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts, which included possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. Pursuant to R. v. R.E.W., the Court held that the youth was the most popular gathering place for older children and adolescents in the district and that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking operation was financial gain."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago the mother unilaterally moved with the children from Nokomis to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. She has formed a new relationship with the father, and she is pregnant. While the father has been in jail since September 2012, first on remand, then as serving prisoner, he has not been seeing the children on a regular basis. His latest affidavit is not entirely clear on how long he will be in jail, but states that he is eligible for early release in December 2013. HELD: 1) The mother's move was unfortunate. While she claims that she has always been the primary caregiver to the children, the father harbours suspicions that she and the children actually remained in Kenaston. While he asks that a pre-trial conference be set, he asks it be delayed until his release. That is not a tenable position. The children cannot remain 'on hold' while he awaits release for, inter alia, beating the mother of the children. There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. 2) There is nothing suggesting the children have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. While this matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded, the mother's willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may well be a factor in her remaining the primary parent."

Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.

The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer had paid $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta by Fraser Brace. The trial judge found the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by the insurer that the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was never required to carry builder's risk insurance. The policy was void and the appellant ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed with costs to be taxed as there was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire loss should be paid to the respondent. There was no contractual relationship between the Province and the insurer, nor between Guardian and Hartford, which could give rise to any obligation on the respondent's part to contribute towards the loss."

The judge was biased. The plaintiff did not receive proper disclosure from the prosecutor and there was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest either he was biased or that there was an apprehension of bias. As for the application to exclude the conditions of a recognizance, the preliminary was not supported by the evidence and the application was dismissed.

The parties married in 1981 and were divorced in 1990. The father was $1,713 in arrears until immediately prior to the matter being heard in chambers. He consented to $1,800 owing for 1997. HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. She also brought an application for an order fixing the amount owing under the previous child support order of Baynton J., dated September 5, 1990.

The court may also impute income where there is evidence of unreasonable expenses, and under s.19(2) of the guidelines, the reasonableness of an expenses deduction is not solely governed by whether the deduction is permitted under the Income Tax Act. 2)The Court declined to include the 1997 income information in this calculation, despite the fact that the guidelines require the court to use the most recent information. 3)The financial evidence filed by the respondent with respect to 1997 was not sufficient nor substantiated sufficiently to determine income.

The appellant identified the defendants as the source of the employment contract for which she had been erroneously dismissed. Awarding the plaintiff five months pay in lieu of notice, that the termination of the contract was in bad faith and the manner of the dismissal was callous. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiff corporations brought an action against the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter transportation by the defendant corporations. The defendants claimed insurance was obtained, and the information was made available to legal counsel for advice and instruction. The action alleged that the defendants knew the helicopter was unsafe, but continued to use it. The court granted leave to reapply for direction. The purpose of having two Kyrgyzstan persons on the Board of Directors of each corporation is to advise when survival gear was placed on board a helicopter, and to that extent whether the budget was over or under is relevant. If the defendant, KOC, was in a position to determine when such survival gear should be placedon board the helicopters, the question should be answered. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue. HELD: The application for direction was granted.  1)It is possible that counsel for the plaintiff will not attempt to introduce the evidence at trial. If he does, the trial judge will be in better position to judge the admissibility of the evidence in question and under what conditions it should be admitted or the weight to be attached to it. 2)A number of internal memoranda were not properly identified. The claimed privilege is too broad and effectively prevents him from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses, which may result in inferences that may be drawn from the evidence. 3)The report of Mr. Rast who was the safety officer at the main camp site prior to the accident is not privileged because he was requested to prepare a safety report prior to this accident but did not get around to it until after the accident."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order to declare that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) This license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. The club's use was not a 'change in use' as it was not defined in either the By-law or the Municipal Government Act. It was common ground that this operation was conforming to the status quo."

On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. Actions of the Crown were not involved. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no breach of the Charter. The delay of two months was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.  2)The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was considered as attributable to C.R. v. Morin, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend. 3)The Court dismissed the application. The remaining delay of one month was either caused by the Crown's delay in calling witnesses or by reasons beyond the accused's control.  4)Discretion was not on the accused to prove prejudice as he had not suffered actual prejudice. The conditions of release he is subject to are not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. 5)The court found no actual or inferred prejudice in the delay as there was no evidence of how this prejudice caused the accused an undue hardship which was different from that faced by other accused charged with similar offences. 6)The accused was released on conditions that restricted him from drinking alcohol. The court found that in this case the prejudice did not outweigh the prejudice that would result if he was not to face trial."
e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff had insurance from his employer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. When he returned to live in the mall, he sought to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. His unsuccessful attempt was refused because the public record still showed he was the registered owner of the vehicle that had been involved in the hit and run incident. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The Court was unable to locate either of them.  1) The plaintiff acknowledged that he sold the van to a woman he had just picked up and wanted to exchange for drugs. He said he did not recall the date of the sale but that he recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to pass on its location and license number. 2) The only clear evidence before the court on the identity of the van is that of the plaintiff himself. His claim that the van was sold to the woman who supplied the drugs was rejected by his lawyer. He retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration which he said he would present to the Court on December 7, 2000. It was this document that led the Court to conclude that the defendant had sold the vehicle to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had no record of the transaction. It is pertinent to note that this statement was signed by the defendant, who is a 12 year old and lives in Dartmouth and has a residence there. He was in Dartmouth when the incident occurred. He did not recognize the defendant from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation file but he recognized him from the driver's license plate when he was alerted to the squeal of tires. The defendant was arrested and taken to the police station where he was charged with several offences under the Motor Vehicle Act. He also testified that he only stayed 5 to 10 minutes in the security office with the police during which time he took a five-minute standing ovation and then took a second look at the van once he was led to the court office. He stated that he was not satisfied with the defendant's version of events, but was satisfied that he had a valid and reliable explanation for the events leading up to the commission of the offence.  2) There"
e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by Patchrite to it. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act.

The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' (a lease that required registration) and it required registration.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents (defendants), the defendants, and the Village of Bjorkdale. The action arose out of burns suffered when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. 1)There was no tenable basis to interfere with the decision of the trial judge. 2)The Court was of the view that expert evidence was necessary to enable the jury to conclude that the actions of the Fire Department fell short of the standard of care and constituted acts of negligence. 3)The Judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable her jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The Court could not have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or contributed to by the respondents."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The issues were that the mother failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child. The application also requested an order allowing the father to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. HELD: 1) There had been a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of the Original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary to joint custody, was possible. As the mother demonstrated that it was not, a review of the order as to custody is justified. 2) The evidence confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. The respondent had been granted sole custody in June 2006 based upon the mother's refusal to accept the shared parenting arrangement. She indicated that she hoped to move away from supervised secured access to the child for an interim period and would work towards joint custody and shared parenting once she was able to demonstrate that she could be trusted not to attempt to abduct her child. There was no evidence that this was done because the mother was unwilling or unable to show that she had any significant change in her circumstances. 3) The custodial parent's reason for moving was not supported by the evidence as it conflicted with the father's other reasons for not exercising shared parenting. The evidence was conclusive that the respondent had not demonstrated that he could improve his parenting skills, the strong bond he forged between himself and his daughter despite the trying conditions, and his fairness in recognizing and reiterating his belief that the child should have the advantage of exposure to both parents despite the unsubstantiated and indeed false allegations made against him. 4) The increased contact between the child and her extended family in the Yukon provides an increased social network that would be in the child's best interest."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant was a First Nations faculty member who was involved in the creation and operation of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. He had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina but believed he was being invited to present the results of research he had done for an Assembly of First Nations national First Nations political organization. After reviewing all of the facts, the board of arbitration concluded that the applicant had not rebutted the requirements of Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Collective Agreement. The decision met the reasonableness test. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1) Before passing upon the merits of the application, it is necessary to determine the standard of review to be applied to the decision of the Board of arbitration. Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction General Workers' Union, 2004 SCC 23, the law in this regard has been reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment, it was clear that the Standard of Review to be apply in this case is one ofreasonableness. 2) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. The reasons as a whole support the decision. 3) The decision does not meet that standard."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The first access issue was for an order that would enable the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The access schedule as detailed by Ryan-Froslie J. was an extrapolation of the previous order. It was reasonable that during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. 2) Access was reduced to two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each during July and August. 3) Applications to alter interim access orders were not the answer. The court moved the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of his non-lawyer agent’s ineffective assistance in the trial. The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was made by the appellant with the assistance of a Law Society member who was self-represented. The appellant abandoned the law society and retained the services of a member of the Law Society to file an amended notice of appeal disclosing the grounds of appeal. The appeal dismissed. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant as he did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the affidavit did not establish a miscarriageof justice. The same conclusion would not follow when an accused chooses to be represented by an agent who is not a lawyer at trial. Nor does the fact that the agent is paid create any presumption as to the agent's competence. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of overturning the conviction on the basis of finding fact.
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence, knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had refused to call any of the witnesses it had called. The accused came before the Court for preliminary inquiry on July 26, 2010. After the Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry and he advised that he wished to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the Defence was not guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The Sergeant was not a material witness in this preliminary inquiry. The Court granted the Defence request for an adjournment so that they could make the necessary arrangements to call the witness as witness for the Defence in the meantime.  1) The primary purpose of preliminary inquiry is to satisfy the justice that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial, with the result that the Crown has discretion to present only enough evidence to establish a prima facie case. 2) It is not possible to be certain that Sergeant Barbar is not a Material Witness. He was present at the accident scene and took measurements, made notes and did some calculations. How he did his calculations and the formulas he used to do his calculations may prove very material especially since the Defence has engaged their own accident reconstructionist. 3) The Defence is not negligent in not going to the trouble and expense of preparing a subpoena that could not be effectively served in any event."
e_2011skqb30.txt,"The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support. HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","A review of the issues of parenting and support as directed by the interim order of August 18, 2010. HELD: 1) The court was not persuaded on this review that it was in the best interests of the children to change the interim access order made in August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it. Those questions are best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility can be considered and adjudicated. The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were also adjourned for review. The court found that considering the existing means and needs of the parties, it was not in the children's best interests to order interim child support since the respondent had not the existing ability to pay it. However, the respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential. 2) The parties shall share child care expenses of $4,380 annually in proportion to their respective incomes, pursuant to s. 7 of the Guidelines. determine the annual income of the petitioner to be $19,500."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that an in-court identification was not necessary; it was sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt had surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice. HELD: The Court found that the accused's identity was established. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was admissible. Although there was no identification in court, the accused was given a Certificate of Intention to Tender and the dates on which the accused might become eligible to obtain a driver's licence were marked as Exhibit P-1 for identification and letter from SGI for identification. The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance notice was the same person who had stood trial."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of a search of her computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. The trial resumed with the Crown presenting all of its evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The determination of their ultimate admissibility was to await completion of argument on s.24(2).HELD: The Court held that the discovery of the computer and the search history of the cell phone did not constitute child pornography. Rather, it was the complainant's testimony that the accused had taken pictures of her in the shower that caused him to ask the officer to look for pictures of the complainant. The officer testified that he did not ask the complainant for the information which he had obtained in the search. The Court found that all of the images were found to be child pornography, and that the search was inexorably inexorable to the conclusion this was the case. Therefore, the exhibits should be excluded."
