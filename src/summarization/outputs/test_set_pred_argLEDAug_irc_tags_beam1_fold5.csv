1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The applicant had been previously barred from entering the investment dealer's premises. The appeal Division found that the test in American Cyanamid does not apply to this case. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. The trial judge reversed the respondent's decision to enter the action and ordered the respondent to return to the drawing board. The appellant appealed the decision. Allowing the application and holding the hearing in confidence, that the application for an injunction was premature. The court should be reluctant to interfere with the affairs of a domestic tribunal such as the I.D.A. Such an application is premature."
1991canlii2535.txt,"This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed, that it was weapon as defined in the Code, and that the appellant intended to use the push dag to cause injury or death to persons."
1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the R.S.N.S.' 1967, and now s. 192 of the Regulations made under the Motor Vehicles Act. The charges were set aside and the fine imposed upon him by the trial judge were restored. The Crown appealed the acquittal of each respondent and the conviction of each of the defendants. Allowing the appeals and restoring the convictions for the three respondents, that on both of these principal issues the trial court judge erred in law. The trial judge had reviewed the record and determined that there were no Charter issues in these appeals and that the summary conviction appeal court judge had erred when he concluded that there had been violations pursuant to the Act. Dismissing the appeals, that s. 174 (now s. 193) was in violation of s. II (d) of the Charter because it completely relieves the Crown of any requirement whatsoever to prove accuracy of the scales. Thus, the Crown has proved its case against the respondents."
1994canlii5206.txt,"The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in the City of Regina. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff sued for damages arising out of a whiplash injury which had been substantially cured over a period of about one year following the accident. Trial Judge applied for the damages to be awarded to the plaintiff and found that the proper level was $18,000. HELD: The proper level at the time of the accident was $10,000 which was adequate to compensate for the non-pecuniary damages. 1)No weight was given to the expert who was familiar with her pre-accident state than to the physical therapist who was unable to quantify that part of her disability. 2)The plaintiff had 10,000 km on her exercise bicycle since the accident and had logged 10,00 km on it. She was concerned only with her diabetes. 3)The physical therapist was unable and unwilling to quantify her present condition. If one adds her pre -accident condition to the two post-accidents falls and subsequent hip replacements it is not possible to conclude on the evidence that the part of the present condition brought about by the accident is related to it. 4)The court awarded $18 million to the plaintiffs cause. This amount is insufficient to compensate the plaintiff for the whiplashes and the loss of housekeeping capacity. Such inconvenience as was suffered during the year following was adequately compensated by the non pecuniary damage award."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would pay the plaintiff a deposit and service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The plaintiff paid the defendant what the terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee in order to help pay the defendant's share of the energy savings enjoyed. The plaintiff brought a motion to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The defendants application to set off the default was dismissed. The court found that the defendants had failed to establish any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. In fact, the Court found that there was no reasonable excuse at all for the defendant to have waited until mid-February 1995 before applying to set it aside."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. HELD: 1)The Court ordered the defendant to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawoline as he now says, at the time of the contempt. 3)The judge ordered the liability to be taxed."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendant medical doctors. He alleged that a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence was impaled on it. He claimed that he was impaling on the fence for half an hour. The triage clerk at the hospital said that the plaintiff had been impaled for a period of time and then fell off the fence. He was hospitalized for 22 days. He claims that antibiotics should have been prescribed, the plaintiff should have seen his family doctor, and the would should not have been closed. He also claims that there was no evidence of infection or of natural disaster. Dismissing the claim, that the defendants and their medical staff did not fall below the standard of care required in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiffs loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other accused took the stand in defence. They were all of the accused's friends. They beat the accused and stole his belongings. At the end of the attack, the accused threw a punch to the face and punched the other two members of his group. The three of them were hospitalized. The victim suffered serious injuries and severe bruising to his eyes, shoulder blades and temples. He required hospital treatment and was given a 10 year prohibition from possessing or carrying a weapon. The accused was also fined $7,500 for robbery. The Court imposed a sentence of two years probation and firearm prohibition. The offence of robbery is most serious offense. The judge found that there was no careful planning on the part of the gang involved in the offence and imposed a ban for 10 years prohibiting you from possessing firearms. The court found that the accused had some talent and some motivation to become a productive member of the community. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to two-years probation. He will benefit from supervision following his release. The mitigating factors were that the Court found that he had a high risk of repeat violent attacks and that he would benefit from supervised supervision following release."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development connected to the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The respondents had met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting and the application was granted. The court found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal or the meetings 'in camera' as the respondent had done throughout the application process. The issue was whether the proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel were invalid by reason of bad faith. The respondents met the prerequisites in that they had not obtained the required information from the applicants, had not taken steps to obtain it from the vendors, and had not proceeded to consider the proposal which was a substantial improvement on the already existing hotel. The proposal was considered but the proposal was not granted in part. There were several issues to be determined, including whether the respondent met the required prerequisites, had the proposal met the onus of proving bad faith, and if so, had met its onus in such a fashion as to make the stated offer."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It did not matter whether the appellants were Indians within the meaning of s. 35(1) of The Constitution Act, 1982 or whether they were Metis. The regulation applied to the appellant as hunters, not as Metis; and 2)It was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: night hunting with artificial lights is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; and 3)It is the position of the appellantes that Metis enjoy hunting rights within the Meaning of s.'12 of the Constitution Act; they are subject to s.'11.1 of the Regulations made under The Wildlife act, 1982. The appellants have aboriginal hunting right protected by the Constitution; the land is an Aboriginal land and is subject to the protection of the Crown. The issue on this appeal is whether the regulation is a prima facie infringement of their Aboriginal right and if so whether it is justifiable. The Aboriginal group has been consulted."
2003skqb550.txt,"The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from Saskatchewan until she obtained a Court order allowing her to do so. The petitioner and her new common law husband had been discussing for some time how best to deal with the child's needs. The child had been experiencing problems at home and at school. The mother took the child to Dr. Verma in Swift Current who prescribed Ritalin, suspecting that the child suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The Ritaline did not have the desired effect and the child was referred to Edmonton where he would have immediate access to medical therapy, consultation with his psychiatrist and advanced modes of therapy including scholastic therapy which are only available in large centres. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice."
2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","Civil Procedure – Rule 173 – Rule 165 The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the applicant's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of Claim to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. 2) A victim who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. The actions of the appellant were justified in the circumstances. The Court takes comfort in the fact that the did not say the crown had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, or that the crown failed to show beyond reasonable suspicion that the appellant did not act in self defence. 3) A decision to strike out an entire claim on a ground that it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuseof process is based on an entirely different footing. Instead of considering merely the adequacy of the pleadings to support a reasonable cause of action, it may involve an assessment of the merits of the claim, and the motives of the plaintiff in bringing it. Evidence other than the pleadent is admissible."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Constitution Act was not a reasonable ground to strike the claim. The claim must survive unless the court makes a finding that the government has breached its constitutional commitment to the grant. The Court also found that, in the clearest of cases, where it is plain and obvious that the claim is not justiciable, the appeal can be allowed."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant was disabled and appealed the decision of the Income Assistance Appeal Board which terminated his income assistance in May 2006. He re-applied for income assistance a second time in 2007. This time, the application was again denied. This was because the applicant had not requested further information. The applicant appealed the Board's decision and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal board on September 6, 2007. The Board allowed the appeal and found that the applicant was 'a person in need' as defined in the Act. The board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. The application for an order in the nature of mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decisionof the Appeal Board enforced. The fact that the board so erred did not mean that it could not exercise its judicial functions under the Act in making determination of whether the DeWolf's were 'persons in need'. The fact is that the Board acted in a discretionary nature and did not have any discretion as to whether the decision was binding generally or as to the time period effected. The Act was required to be done when the Appeal board released its decision, retroactive to June 2007."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a fishing truck without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and with operating without a valid driving licence contrary (Saskatchewan s. 13(1)) of the Act. At the close of the Crown's case, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of the act, alleging it breaches s. and 11(d) of The Charter of Rights. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s 27 of theAct. The accused had a fishing licence issued by the Minister of Environment. There had been no valid ministerial order in place pursuant to s 27. The Court declined to decide the constitutional question as it was moot."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown had previously sought leave to argue its appeal. The accused was charged with assault contrary to s.(1)(a) the Criminal code. The Provincial Court found the accused guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal the Queen's Bench judge quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The Court found that the trial judge did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence, and in particular the trial Judge focused on the fact there were two officers present. The trial judge also found that (1) the accused's mistake of fact was reasonable, but he did not address the appellant's statement that the finger incident occurred twice and he did Not address the respondent's evidence that he viewed the person he viewed as a threat to the officer. The Appeal judge erred in both ways. The failure on the part of the trial court to consider the respondent’s mistake of facts and to assess the proportionality of his response was not an unreasonable conclusion. The appeal judge reviewed the issues and found that: 1) the trial trial judge was not trying to take the respondent into account; 2) the judge was trying to gauge the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused; and 3) the reasonableness of the accused’ s belief that he was being threatened. The respondent was not touched by the officer nor did the officer attempt or threaten by an act or gesture to apply force to the appellant. The officer at the scene did not feel endangered and at no time took any steps such as pulling out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation. The force used by the trial officer in reacting to the perceived threat was justified. The court was not entitled to overturn the conviction."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, aged 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The primary issue between the parties was custody of the children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. The mother, who had recently moved from Prince Albert to Alberta, had special needs that required consistency and stability to ensure she did not regress. The father, who was currently living in the United States, was working and living in a common law relationship. The parties lived in the same home for several years and it was during this time that the mother began to develop new friendships and began to visit the father. The children were in the joint custody of both parents and there was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. HELD: The children's best interests were found to be in the custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.' and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The mother's motivation was to relocate to Alberta to marry a different person. Although she had expressed some interest in staying in the U.S., she did so under the impression that she would be removed from the opportunity to learn and to have a closer relationship with her children. Although there was some uncertainty about the future plans of both parties, the evidence showed that they would be able to support one another in their new home. 2) The father's move would have a significant impact on the children's quality of contract. The parents would have to make arrangements to have their children stay in the common law home with their father. While there was a significant disparity in the income of the parties, their relationship, co-operation and communication with each other deteriorated. It was in their best interests that they be in joint custody and that they reside an equal time in both homes, alternating alternating every 2 weeks."
2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the husband would have interim sole custody. By an agreement in November 1997 the wife was diagnosed with unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar clinical depression and underwent treatment for depression. She had just commenced kindergarten. The husband had recently been discharged. HELD: The application for interim care was dismissed. The court found that it constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of any evidence of risk to the child. The respondent was the more loving and caring parent. The child was in kindergarten for 1 1/2 years. The wife was to have access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:30 p.M. and alternate Sundays from 10:00 a.m.-7:30p.m.. The applicant's emotional health made it difficult for her to cope with the child over extended periods of time. The evidence before the court was conclusive that the applicant could care for the child for extended periods."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to improve her economic prospects and sought to ameliorate the unequal division regime which the husband registration imposed. She was to award him $25,000 against the matrimonial home. The husband had no savings, no pension and had to assume a large mortgage. HELD: The husband was awarded $1,000.00 against the home. 1)The matrimony home was prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties, the long term family home of the wife and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. The marriage was of modest means and had few assets. The matrimonial home was of significant importance to the wife as it was her home base. 2)The wife was awarded the $5,000 plus an award of $5k for a total of $6,945.00.  3)The husband was to claim an exemption for his own house, jointly owned with his mother as protection against any loss of income and property.  4)The court accepted the claim that the matriconial home jointly owned by the mother and Edward Lang was to assume debts of $1 million. The court rounded out the numbers and ignored the fact that the mortgage on the matonial home was reduced by about $10,000 during the period in question. Both parties had the benefit of the matramonial home during the marriage."

Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. The defendant resisted the claim and by way of a counterclaim sought judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $4,007.83. The amount of the unpaid extras was $1,000.00. The plaintiff did not ask for them but he was liable to pay for them. The court found that there was no negligence on the part of the contractor and responsibility rested with the defendant. The Court also found that the appraiser was aware of the problems with the foundation, but did not accept the plaintiff's suggestion that the problem was a minor one. The appraiser had no evidence that the plaintiff paid for the whole of the problem. The defendants should have known that the money owed by the defendant was to be the actual cost to the defendant and accordingly the claim was dismissed."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant entered into a two-year commercial lease with the intention of fixing the problem by arbitration. The landlord challenged the arbitrator's jurisdiction to award damages, arguing that the award should be quashed. The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrators quashed on the grounds the arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the decision was patently unreasonable. The arbitrator was appointed by the court to deal with the issue of jurisdiction of the arbitration panel. The tenants argued that the arbitration clauses in the lease were far broader than that in the other leases and that the arbitration panel was properly constituted. They also questioned the jurisdiction of a statutory tribunal, given its greater degree of judicial deference, and the greater degree to which the arbitrating panel applied the test in Lachance v. Lifchus (1993) and the decisions of the interveners in the arbitration arena. The interveners all agreed that the decision of the Arbitrator was pathetically unreasonable and that it was appropriate to defer to the decision by the intervener. The court adopted the reasoning in Lifchance and the dissenting opinions in Bridgepoint International and in Bridgeport. The decision of Lifchome was the first to be held by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal in both cases. The dissenting opinion was that the trial judge erred in interpreting the clause as if the words 'the interpretation of' any clause or provision of the lease appeared in s. 15.10. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. The Court of Queen's Bench also held that the same test applies to awards of consensual arbitrators. The arbitration clause under the lease was a limitation on the scope of the jurisdiction the arbiter could exercise. The award was therefore subject to judicial review even if patently unrealistic. The disputes were with respect to the repair and the loss of rental opportunity."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The father, who was the only family member who could secure loans to pay for his daughter's education, applied pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the mother's application. Application dismissed; the father had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The mother's original application for relief was for a retroactive order to cover loan payments for educational purposes. The father's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactivity child support order was dismissed. There was no evidence that the mother had declared any interest in the loans at the time of the application. The only evidence advanced in support of the indemnity agreement was that the father was responsible for the repayment of the loans. The daughter had completed high school and was in the university. The loan payments were made to the father by the mother and were part of the child's education budget. The son's application to strike the mother out for child support under Rule 14 was also dismissed. The application to vary in scope and in length was also struck. The applicant's original grounds of appeal were not questions of fact but of circumstance."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

HELD: It was the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in this proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board of directors of 608. The issues are straightforward. The plaintiff and defendants who are in this action have status. The defendant in the proceedings and the board president of 689 have professional and fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff. The nature of the action is such that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 605 as he is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action.

2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. The father was depressed and remorseful. The trial judge found the truck was used for the trafficking contrary, but had registered no lien to protect his interests. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and allowed the respondent to be returned to his parents. The sentence was at the low end of the range but the Court found there was no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. A more significant issue was the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeition of the vehicle used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and deliver them. The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents and he had a previous criminal record. The judge found that 'basically all of the money to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account to the kid to pay the truck'. He found the vehicle integral in the operation of transporting him to various places across the country. The Crown sought forfeiture of it. The defendant was a first-time offender with no previous criminal records. He had 280 pills in his vehicle. The Sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order the forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. The conviction was a miscarriage of justice because the Court had not considered the definition in the Act. The sentences were tied particularly to the offence. The respondent was trafficking out of his truck. The impact of an order of forfeiture made under s. 16(1) would be disproportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of a designated substance offence, and the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. The fact that the respondent had used it as transportation was a significant issue. The mitigating factors were that the defendant was low-risk to re-offend, had no prior record and appeared innocent of any complicity in the offence or collusion. The evidence showed the truck had a low risk of re-accuseation and had registered a lien in respect of trafficking. The principles of forfeiture and forfeiture were clearly applicable to this offence."
2_2007skqb99.txt,"This judgment dealt with divorce and division of family property. At issue was the value of the matrimonial home and the balance of family property. HELD: Decree of divorce issued. Valuations of the family home and property were made, and exemptions and equitable considerations were addressed. Equalization payments were prescribed. As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were in agreement that other family property be divided equally between them. However, the parties separated in 2002. Due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. The sole issue was the issue of the valuation of the family home. HELD: 1) The matrimonial property or its value, both as defined in s. 2, be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions, and equitable considerations mentioned in the Family Property Act. The value for distribution is set aside and the matter is determined as it was before the application. 2) The evidence was placed before the court as it is and it was found that the date of application was to be preferred over the date. 3) The balance of the Family property was not included in the family property to be distributed as a result of the separation. The purpose of the legislation and the practice of the Court is to resolve these cases along the lines suggested by Carter, J., in Rathie v. Rathie (1980), 1980 CanLII 2016 (SE QB), and in 1980 CanMLII 2016. 4) The Court fixed July 2005 as the application date for the valuation. This change in circumstance was not the end of the matter. The matter was resolved with respect to the balance of family land. 5) The Matrimonial Property Act does not require an adjustment for the value of any particular piece of land. The principles of the common law apply. The Court will select the date as it has determined them to be most appropriate. 6) The Act does provide an adjustment in the amount of $478 for the amount arising out of the dispute. The evidence is placed before me as it will be. However the evidence is not as it should be. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead to conclusion that the Date of adjudication is to be favoured over the Date Of Application."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for 'accident' and the Workers' compensation Appeals Tribunal upheld the respondent's decision to exclude the respondent from the definition of 'personal injury by accident' (GECA) and the appellant appealed. The appeal turned on one main issue: whether the Workers’ Compensation Appeals tribunal (WCat) wrong to assess the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. The appellant’s evidence about the nature and extent of the events which he claimed gave rise to the GECA was found to be inconsistent with the approach required under the Policy. The respondent had often decided that it was not compensable under GECA. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the tribunal level and found that there were no workplace stressors which could have been compensable for gradual onset stress. The Appeal Commissioner’ s reasoning process was unreasonable and there was uncertainty about whether gradual onset trauma was compensable. The court reviewed the history of the tribunal and found there was no inconsistency with the standard by which it applied the test in the first issue and how it applied it to the second issue. The decision of the Appeal Commissioner was consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick. The trial judge in this case did not err in deciding the respondent’d gradual onset onset stress claim was correct. The issue was whether the Policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker’S situation. The policy set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable, namely, that each type is compensably subject to change. The Policy also sets out certain of the express statutory inclusions (i.e., “a wilful and intentional act” or “an accident”) which should be included by judicial interpretation. The principles and approach of the court were consistent with those in Dunstan v. N.L.I. The dissenting judge in the trial court in Newfoundland and Labrador (Rees) did not find that there had been unusual and excessive stressors in the workplace which could ground a claim for gradual start stress. It found that the worker did not have unusual or excessive stressor in the work-related events or stressors experienced by him.

It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The landlord self-represented against the landlord on the basis that the landlord allowed mould to develop in her basement, failed to rectify the problem, and ruined her belongings. The landlord paid the tenant $787.50 as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The tenant also appealed against the damages award. HELD: Appeal allowed. The damages were set at $862.50. The Court rejected the landlord's evidence entirely. On a strong balance of probabilities that there was mould in the premises and it only affected the tenant's furniture and area rug. It was impossible to believe that the tenant, had she not been convinced by something as amateurish as spray paint, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it.

He failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health andsafety of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant had been out all night, drinking and had not slept. He had made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy of the dairy farm worker who died in the manure pit. He was in no condition to operate equipment which he needed to remove manure from the pit and placed himself at risk. Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability because he also had no prior record for Occupational health and Safety offences."

The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The Court must consider the subjective and objective grounds of the demand, the fact that the accused was inebriated, the accused's driving actions, the manner in which he was attempting to orient himself and the fact he was trying to find his bearings all support the objective evidence of impaired driver impairment. 2) The accused was cooperative and did not ask what was going on in his head. He was not drinking. 3) The breath samples were taken as soon as practicable after the time the accused left the vehicle, not later than 2 hours after that time, with an interval of approximately 15 minutes between the times when the samples were received. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he was impaired and the manner of the samples obtained were objective evidence that the Court could not reasonably conclude that the impaired driver was impaired."

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The matter required court time on two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. The Applicant was the successful party on the important parenting issue. The Court awarded costs of $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The court awarded costs in the amount of $5,000 to the successful parties; in the case of the uncontested issue of costs, the successful Party was awarded costs at $3 million. The amount of legal and accounting fees may be deducted from total income to determine taxable income. If a party is able to deduct legal expenses from total incomes, the resulting reduction in total income serves to diminish the litigant's tax bill. Costs are assessed against the respondent. The parties litigated the appregation of custody, access and child support, and quantification. The issues on issue were the assessment of child and child care, the assessment on the issue of child care and the award of costs warranted. The successful party's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. The costs award was not for a very good reason and the need for the court to exercise its discretion and to move away from strict application of the Tariffs is often present."

The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized.

At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs.

Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's crop on one occasion but denies liability. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs and together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows: 1)The plaintiff was responsible for crop loss; 2)The defendant's cows were in his canola crop on more than one occasion and that other cattle were not in the field. 3)The judge found that the cattle were found to be the cause of most of the crop loss. The judge found the damages sustained were as follow: 1).The plaintiff had to combine most of his cattle but was put to the expense and inconvenience of having to combine around the numerous yard-square plots and poor areas and combine those plots separately. 4)The court accepted the evidence of a wildlife expert whose findings were supported by the evidence as to the actual damage to the crop. The wildlife expert's findings were not sufficient to establish the actual damages. 5)The damages sustained as result of defendant's livestock were reduced to be as follows. 1)Their grazing was in good condition and they did not move toward the crop crop. 2)Their cattle were confined to their canola fields. 3)'Their transportation was limited to the Carrot River. 4)'Their access to the farm was limited. 5)'Their trail system was of long standing and was of relatively short standing. 5')Their access was blocked by the Carrots River. The fields were blocked by a road. The gravel was in poor condition. The plaintiffs had to arrange for transportation to and from the farm. 5"")Their cattle did not venture out of the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother or his hired help.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired.

The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The injunty relief as a whole seeks to enforce certain restrictive coords, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.  3) The employer or employer is in law obliged to give reasonable notice of an intention to terminate the relationship until after their respective contracts of employment have been terminated by the expiry of reasonable period of notice. In the event that Danka's customers are attracted from its former customers, the issuance of such a notice will not be allowed. 4) The application to strike the respondent's employees for breach of contract was dismissed. The respondent had not established a primari facie ground of imminent danger of substantial damage.  5) The Court found that the respondent had failed to establish a primae facie base of the impugned conduct it alleges constitutes the unlawful interference with Danka’s existing legal rights. The injunctions were imposed to enforce the restrictive coelvenants, restrain the employees from solicitation of customers from Danka, from performing any service work to equipment that was sold or rented by DANKA, and to prevent the respondent from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the customers of the corporation by virtue of having received an employee Handbook from DANKa.  6) The respondent has failed to show a primamie case, in support of that right or a serious possibility that it will succeed at trial.

This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. 4)The Court's task is not solely to decide whether mentally challenged parents can be taught to care for children, but instead, in who's care will [A.]s best interests be advanced.

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.

The respondent proposes to use Canada Savings Bonds as an investment, with the objective of providing maximum contact between the parties. The Court reviewed the access provisions submitted for consideration at hearing of the petitioner. The issue of custody was resolved at trial.

The parties had agreed that they would have joint custody with specific access to the children, however the Court ordered that the custodial alternatives sole or joint custody should be ordered with specific authority. The Corollaries Relief order would reflect the parties agreement for each parent to hold in trust and administer one-half the investments and would remind them that this is the childrens money and they are responsible and accountable to the boys for the monies. 3)The Children's Investments Investments were to be jointly administered and controlled by the parties or alternatively that half the investments be transferred to his control to hold a trust and to administer, and the other half be held and administered by the petitioner with specific ability to access.

After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985.

The parties both expected to outlive their former spouses and on her death he expected thereby to regain the balance of the pension asset.

The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The documents in issue were not ordered for resale. They were merely shipped to the destination designated by the appellant which in the boards' view would not represent the requirement of being 'published' as provided for in the Act. The purpose for which the documents were ordered was to be published and that they contain no advertising. 2)The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 3)The respondent appealed under S. 21(1) of the Act which provides that on an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. Hearsay: The Court's role is supervisory in nature. Questions of law are within the purview of the Court. On questions of fact the Court's job is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not warrants findings of fact made by the Board. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which the purchase of the documentation is an independent purchase but rather the purpose for whom it was produced, distributed and made available. The facts are found to be consistent with the findings made by a Board of Directors decision."

4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and s.62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the adjudication's finding that the respondent's employee had not frustrated or fundamentally breached her employment contract gave rise to the following issues: 1) Did the adjudicating adjudicator err in law by finding that respondent's conduct had not rendered the partiesincapable of performing their contractual obligations; 2) Whether the adjudicators exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that the employer, as the respondent\'s employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that hadhibited her from reporting to work; and 3)Whether the adjudicated adjudicator acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of the respondent`s employment contract were and that Cajon had not fulfilled its obligations therein. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them, in addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at the same. Although not all of the facts presented to him were known to the Court, his decision outlines some evidence upon which he might have arrived at his conclusions. By not engaging in these further inquiries and efforts outlined above the respondent had not satisfied the adjudent it was incapable of carrying out its obligations. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to the circumstances of this case. 2)The Court found that the adjudicate acted well in his jurisdiction and beyond his prerogative to make the decision which would radically alter the original agreement into something other than thatintended. The adjudicator did not make an error in law but was unable to interfere with the adjudicative's findings of facts."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal. He was a guidance counsellor for the plaintiff's education complex from 1988 to 1997. He remained in that position until his 1997 termination. In 1990 he became co-ordinator of post secondary education programs and remained in this position until terminated in May 1997. In 1997 he sought damages as he lost his job and lost his pension. He sought damages against the corporate board of directors for insubordination and damages for breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages and punitive damages. He will have his taxable costs of the proceeding plus all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff was not the only employee dismissed without cause during a currency of fixed term contract. An employee dismissed with cause during the currency of a fixed term is entitled to be paid for the whole of the term. 2)The onus of proving the existence of just cause always lies with the employer and it is not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the employee or dissatisfaction with his or her job performance. 3)The Court could not find any reason to believe that the plaintiff had acted insubordinate or had a lack of initiative or initiative on his part. The facts did not justify summary dismissal.

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards.

4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime. The accused was a student at the time and had been seen on the wharf drinking beer. The police had noticed a large amount of alcohol in the area and noticed a bag of cash stuffed in the passenger seat. The officer went to move a knapsack on the floor to check for further alcohol and noticed it felt heavy. When he picked up the knapsock, it felt heavier and he could feel what he thought might be bottles of cocaine and cash. When the police entered the vehicle, they found a large quantity of cocaine, a large number of cash and a large sum of cocaine. The knapsacks were found in an open motor vehicle and were of the type used by drug traffickers to package cocaine. At the police station, they were found to contain three rolls of cash, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and three rolls containing $1000 were found. The Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. HELD: The accused is guilty of all three charges before the Court.  1) The evidence was admissible against the accused. The evidence established that the knapacks were in his personal possession and that, because they were in small denominations, found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine but rolled in a manner in that drug dealers would hold their money there. The Court accepted that the money was found in a knappedack on a floor near vehicles on the Wharf. 2) The knapping was found to have been used to secure the knapping. The amount of cocaine found in it was similar to cocaine but the knappedapsack had been found in another vehicle. 3) The Court was satisfied that the evidence established the drugs were for the intended purpose of the trafficking and that the cash was found at the hands of the accused knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to proper defend the claim. HELD: The defendant was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The examinations for the discovery and production of documents can provide a defendant with information as to the particulars of the cases and the costs to which the plaintiff is entitled to pay. The defendant is entitled, once the action is set down for trial, to strike out the offending portions of the statement of claim.  1) The pleadings do not fulfill the requirements of Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. Rule 173 requires the defendant name and provide particulars to the court. 2) The defendant clearly states that he has the legal knowledge of the legislation and the applicable laws. The evidence does not establish that the statutory responsibility for education lies with the defendant. The Government is entitled in law to know the case it has to meet. 3) The evidence is not conclusive that the claim is not credible. The pleaders do not provide particulars of statutory schemes. The question is whether the claim has a foundation for breach of trust or is it redundant? 4) The conduct for discovery, production and/or delivery of documents is not the same as in any other class of action. The legislature is entitled only to act in the best interest of the people they represent. The administration is entitled not to strike any of the pleadings."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was an addict and her alcoholism adversely affected the child. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for her child, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence. Even if the hearsay were admissible the mother should have made an order directed at the father. Even though the mother's affidavits were based on hearsay, there was no case for even direction of the trial of any issue, let alone an order in favour of the father, given that the evidence of the expert and the psychologist had been previously made out. Even with the hearsays evidence, there wasn't even a case for an order for trial of this issue, and the father was awarded leave to reapply on proper evidence if so advised."
4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine. The plaintiff also claims damages for breachof an employment contract when the plaintiff employed Sullivan as a manager. Sullivan was no longer employed by the plaintiff and was now employed by PCS. The defendant argues that the plaintiff breached her employment contract by submitting a proposal to the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded costs against the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to costs against Sullivan and the plaintiff amends the contract for an additional three months. The only issue is whether Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity. The law is clear that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although Sullivan had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, he was still employed at the time he submitted the proposal. The claim against PCS is dismissed. The trial judge erred in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The position of Sullivan when he submitted his proposal was almost identical to that of the plaintiff in this case. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiffs company. He did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. The fact that the bid was made two weeks before the contract ended, which persuaded him that her conduct was not breach of fidelity or a breach of his contract of employment. The sole issue is if Sullivan breached the duty of good faith by submitting his proposal when he was no more employed by her. Hearsay: The law has been settled that an employer is underan implied obligation to compete during the period of his/her employment. An employee who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment obligation. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was unable to distinguish the actions of Sullivan and Restauronics. The court awarded the plaintiff $500 in damages. The amount of damages awarded against the employer is reduced to $500. The employer is entitled only to costs."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act,1997. HELD: 1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short-term relationship and the fact that the applicant has always been the primary caregiver of the three children, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. 2) The respondent has always stood in loco parentis to the children, which is a prima facie case for entitlement. The fact the respondent is a parent here does not mean that he may not also be legally responsible to provide support to the child. Given the short relationship and given the long-term nature of the child, a spousal support payment of $1,500 per month would go some way to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were at all material times residents of the Province of Alberta. In August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in the Province Of Saskatchewan. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiff sustained 'right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder' this being the language appearing at para. 8, 9 and 10 of the plaintiffs' statement of claim. The defendants applied for particulars of the plaintiff's statement of claims. Each defendant had furnished a draft order. HELD: The defendants' applications were granted. Each of the defendants was entitled to a further and better statement of the nature of their claim and to better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than I was able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issues for resolution were divorce, custody and access. Divorce, custody, access and maintenance for the children were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The eldest son claimed an interest in the standing crop but the respondent failed to give notice of his interest. The court valued the farm equipment at $300 per month and the petitioner's income at $11,376. The farm partnership had three children of its own. The oldest son claimed a interest in cattle, but the court did not find any evidence as to its value. The auction house had a value of $1,200 but it was found to be over $10,000. There were no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs. The Court of Appeal ordered judgment against the respondent for the sum of $113,155.19 less the sum that was paid to the petitioner less half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment was a charge on the respondent's personal land."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be retroactive; 2) whether costs should be added to the child's costs; and 3) whether this child support should be made retroactive. The child support application was not opposed. The main issues related to s. 7 expenses and the retroactive support order. The only issue which the Court found was whether ongoing support should remain retroactive to August 2000; the child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements set out in s.7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act. The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he had made no financial disclosure to the Court prior to trial, so there was no basis upon which s. seven expenses should be ordered retroactive or whether such an order would interfere with his ability to meet his ongoing support obligations."
5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.",This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive retroactive pay. The appellant had argued that the phrase 'any employer' referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time. The respondent had argued the employee should be entitled to retroactive wage adjustments from every employer for him to the date of retirement. Arbitrator found the phrase to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He concluded in his ratio of 1:1 that this was an error and patently unreasonable error. HELD: The appeal was dismissed orally.  1)The arbitrator found this phrase to have ambiguous and indicated the reasons for each competing interpretation. He then concluded in ratio of 2:1 which was not persuasive. 2)The entire agreement was subject to the arbitration process and the findings of the Court of Appeal were patently unreasonably patently unjust. 3)The phrase in question was ambiguous and the competing interpretation was not an unambiguous one. Arbitrators have not met the burden of proof placed upon them on the balance of probabilities test.
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",The Students' Union and the Students'' Union appealed a Queen's Bench order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The FOI and Students' unions both sought relief under s. 225 of the Act. The former director of the Students’ Union applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to the Act and obtained an order declaring it to be Of no force and effect. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs.  1) The former Director of the Student Union had standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the act. He had been actively involved in the referendum campaign and was a leading voice against joining the Federation. He was a member of the student council prior to the referendum. He is a proper person to bring the application. 2) The Court of Appeal was entirely satisfied that the former Director was a 'proper person' to bring this application. He did not challenge the actions of the students’ union on the basis that they were in good faith or in accord with the broad rules of natural justice. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the referendum participants. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The Court was entirely convinced that the respondent was a “proper Person” to bring that application. The fact that he was a student at the University at the time of the referendum and was active in the debate and during the campaign did not hinder its ability to ratify the result. The issues to which the Court was directed to look at were the same issues in relation to the referenda process. The respondent was clearly involved in both the referendum campaigning and the events leading up to the vote. He played a significant role in the decision to grant the relief requested by the Chambers judge. The appeal was also dismissed with the costs.
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The father sought costs out of the estate. The issues were not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the failure of the representatives of the family's estate to provide an accounting. The central issue in the father's application was not about his mother’s will but rather about the implied promise against revocation, which his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. The issue was whether the will could be relied upon as an accounting for a share of a condominium held jointly by the parents. The family had made a mutual will supported by an implied promise of revocation, a promise his father had breached by not making a Will in favour his sister. The mother had made this gift only after she died. It was not a personal favouritism claim and the father was entitled to some solicitor and client costs."

The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff broker for the defendant real estate brokerage firm applied for and was awarded a commission of 10% on the basis of a'reasonable amount' of information, including information about the client's family, friends and property. The defendant had been a seasonal resident in 1973 and acquired many parcels of land in the area. He eventually sold the land to the private equity firm of a broker who was also his broker. The transaction was negotiated privately between the broker and the various owners.

The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant commenced an action against the respondent physician alleging negligence in the performance of a circumcision. The respondent had performed the circumcision three days after the appellant went into the emergency department complaining of pain. The appellant commenced this action against him alleging negligence. The physician declined to be an expert witness in the action and provided the names of three other urologists whose names were provided by the appellant and declined to act as an expert witnesses. The chambers judge considered this issue of opinion and, in doing so, erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the appellant could only be compelled to answer interrogatories that required an opinion. The issue was whether the opinions sought by the interrogatories were opinions which CPR 19 required be provided to the appellant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part.  1)The chambers judge did not err in providing in the order that in the event the appellant serves further interrogatories or requests discovery of the physician, the appellant will pay the appellant's reasonable hourly rate.  2)The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. The main case the chambers judge relied on in Eckersley v. Terwiel was an interlocutory order and the standard of review is that of a doctor who is a doctor. The doctor is not required to answer all of the interrogatory interrogatories. In fact, he is only required to provide a summary of the medical evidence filed in respect of the operation and the medical reasons for performing the surgery. The medical evidence obtained through interrogatories is generally understood by layman. The court was satisfied the appellant was not required by law to answer questions on the basis of opinion, particularly concerning matters involving the treatment of the appellant who had not previously been treated. The appeal was permitted in part by allowing the appellant to attend discovery."

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning Tristena have been resolved. The issue for this Court is whether Tristeen is a 'child of the' marriage (and if so what his obligations to pay Child Support should be) as defined By the Divorces Act (Criminal Law), and if so if so who his obligation should be. HELD: 1) The threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the natural parental role. 2) The Court was unable to conclude that the respondent did not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made. The threshold is set at a sufficiently high point that it avoids the imposition of obligations and the acquisition of custody rights except where the step-child can be shown to having assumed the roles of the biological parent and in substantial substitute for the Natural parent's role. 3) The respondent is a person of the person in the position of parent in the Divources Act."

His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The bankrupt claimed that he had been insolvent since 2002 and that he relied on financing from the bank. He claimed that the drought had caused his operation to fail, and that his cattle operation had failed to meet his required monthly income.

6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in with the mother. They lived together for several years. The mother later moved in to live with the father. They had two older children, aged 11 and 11. The oldest son, Johnathan, was in the military for a year and had graduated from high school. He was in trouble at school. The other son, a young man, had been in the Marines for a while and had expressed a fear of his stepbrother, Tyler, who was inebriated. The father had recently been charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm, dangerous driving causing harm and driving over '08. HELD: The parties were ordered to forthwith pay child tax benefits of $300 per month. The child support and employment supplement were to be paid by the parties. The petitioner was to supervise the boys' living arrangements. The issues were to determine whether the child should have access to the mother through the mother or by the father through the father; if so, what arrangement the parties had in place to facilitate that access; if any of the arrangements were in good standing with the Court; if anything, the Court should facilitate that contact with the child. The Court must consider the best interests of each party, particularly in view of the child's future. The respondent was to bear the responsibility of caring for the children and to ensure that their needs were met through the home and in the workplace, their relationship and their shared activities were protected. The court must also consider the emotional impact of a child's early years on the family. The parties had no children of their own. The youngest son, who is in the early stages of his life, was diagnosed with ADD and had a history of poor sleep. He had recently had a serious motor vehicle accident. He suffered a fractured leg, a concussion and continued pain in the neck and shoulder. The children had moved in together after the father's employment arrangement fell apart. He no longer worked full-time, and was in a position of responsibility for the older son's care. The two older boys had moved into assisted living and were no longer with the petitioner. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. The judge found the respondent was not entitled to the benefits and awarded him lump sum payments of $8,041.86 retroactive to December 4, 2011. The reason for this was because the respondent had been late in work and had taken extra time off work. The failure of the respondent to pay child support"
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. The accused is A repeat violent offender who is still serving his sentence for a sexual assault conviction and out of a weekend pass when the last of the accused committed his final sexual assault offences against his niece. HELD: The accused was granted one recognizant. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. The Court reviewed the officer's and the accused's individual circumstances and found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, and indeed Ms. Woytiuk, that the accused will commit a serious personal injury offence are reasonable. The only issue to be determined is whether that objective person agrees with the accused’s subjective belief that the defendant will commit another serious personal injuries offence or sexual assault. 2) The Court found that the officer’ s.810.2 recognizable and objective principles apply. The judge found that it was impossible to make generality of that sort of evidence. The officer”s professional experience was sufficient to justify the use of the term “expert” in the context of her job. The court found that there were significant gaps in the officer and the public” s.2”diversity” evidence. 3) The officer testified that she had worked with the Correctional Service of Canada for 29 years and had plenty of experience in the areas of assessing and supervising inmates while institutionalized. The fact that the offender had been denied programming by the prison system for 5 years and then reapplied for a third recognance in 2012 and 2013 did not outweigh the fact that she was unable to assess the officer because she was a parole officer."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made an issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has failed to establish a genuine issue for a trial to determine the will in viva voce. 2) The court was not satisfied that there was a genuine issues to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge was based, such as lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence. 3) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. 4) The evidence is extensive and the court was unable to obtain the specific evidence it needed. 5) The respondent's evidence is inconsistent and inconsistent on material points or when credibility is in issue. The presumption, however, may be short-lived. None of the daughters resided in Saskatchewan at the time of the deceased's death. The court is also not satisfied by the evidence presented. The respondent was found to have had no hesitation in preparing the 2013 Will. In fact, the Court was able to conclude that the will was in good standing. 6) The issues are an option for the Chambers judge if the evidence itself is not in dispute and the only questions are the inferences to be drawn from the facts."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. She suffered a miscarriage while in the marriage. She was seeking maintenance. The parties were divorced in 1990. The respondent is employed by Public Works. He is employed as Public Works Canada. He worked considerable overtime in 1989 which brought his income up to $48,000. HELD: The respondent was awarded $500 per month interim maintenance. 1)It was inappropriate to award the requested amount of $500. The court could well take that into account if on the hearing of the divorce it is determined that the petitioner is entitled to periodic maintenance for a period of time. There was some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to become a pregnant and the fact that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage, the court found. 2)The petitioner should attempt to upgrade her educational qualifications. The Court was not satisfied that, even if it was a causal relationship, the petitioner would not be entitled to maintenance for any lengthy period of period of Time. It was appropriate to award a nominal amount plus a small lump sum with the sum to be paid to the petitioner."
7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order which determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court was not hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of settlement unless there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of a party or the minutes of a settlement are too vague to enforce. 2)The fiat ended all negotiations. The appellant was bound by her agreement as of its value. 3)The appellant was to produce a statement of the value as of the date of the application."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was stopped by a plainclothes police officer (C.C.A.) on June 21, 1993. He was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level (BAA) after trial. The Crown appealed on the ground the summary conviction appeal court decision overturned the appellant's conviction on the basis that the police officer based her conclusions for the breathalyzer demand on observations made after she requested that the respondent accompany her back to the police cruiser. The C.C.'s lawyer then requested that he provide a breath sample. The officer gave the breath sample without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device and the accused failed the ALERT test. The appellant appealed on that basis. Dismissing the appeal, that the C.A.A.'s conclusions were not the only price to pay for the privilege of driving. The Court held that the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned was violated pursuant to s. 9 of the Charter. The flexible approach to the appeal was used in view of the fact that the appellant was not stopped by the police, but was detained for the purpose of the trial."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable that a separate issue will result in an end.

The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000.

The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.

The first was that s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. The bankrupt argued that this was a final matter and Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules required that affidavit evidence must be basedupon personal knowledge. HELD: 1)The bankrupt's claim was dismissed.  2)The court found that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution. Rule 319 requires that affidavit testimony must bebased upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge (see: s.172(1)). 3)The respondent made an application for a discharge under s. 172 of the Act.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the Credit union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit University became tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonsets and was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union took the position that it should be re-imbursed either as Quantum Meruit or a tenant at will Gari for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail. 2) The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the applicant actually recovered. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. The evidence is well short-lived and falls well behind the damages determined in connection with the tenancy at sufferage issue. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The plaintiff could not have derived rent from Garis land had the Building not been removed. The fact that the building was occupied by tenants and not occupied by financers was a factor. The court was unable to accept that the credit union could not be either a tenant or tenant at suffersance and thus liable for use and occupation of the property. The accused had a claim for rent and reimbursement for the unpaid taxes paid by the tenant. The defendant had a duty to pay taxes. It was not necessary to further consider the unjust enrichment claim. The appropriate remedy would be to seek a mandatory injunction that the Building be removed from the premises and for damages suffered during the period after the demand that the buildings not be removed. If that issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by the plaintiff against the Credit Corporation."

The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","A horrible event took place which resulted in serious injury to a member of this community. Several individuals told the police that the accused youth is responsible for those injuries.

The youth was to be released on conditions including continued access to internet and communication with her parents. The Court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the injuries and determined that the appropriate sentence would be imposed.

The accused was charged with robbery at a local financial institution and the present matter. She was cautioned that she could offend in court and that if convicted at trial she will create a dangerous and other danger to the community. She had a previous criminal record for offences committed by other unrelated persons.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused successfully challenged the Crown's decision to adduce new evidence two days into her trial. The accused claimed her right to make full answer and defence was compromised, denying her a trial date. She applied for an order declaring the Crown had not disclosed the evidence to the defence, and for the Court to order a mistrial. Application allowed; trial to proceed as scheduled; the Crown must show that it has not pre-judiced the complainant's decision-making process; the new evidence can be used to impeach, contradict or otherwise impugn the accused's credibility; and, in the context of a trial, it can be of significant interest to the Crown to preserve the Crown’s agreement to disclose the evidence. The complainant had made important tactical decisions regarding the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crowns case. The Court was satisfied that the complainant had been prejudiced. The Crown had made significant decisions regarding how to deal with the new information, including by notifying the defence counsel of the new discovery, and by entering into specific agreements regarding re-election. The court was satisfied there was a breach of the accused’ s. and s. 11(d) Charter rights. The respondent had made strategic decisions regarding her defence, including not re-electing a judge on a motion to dismiss her trial, and making sure that she was re-elected. The decision was so important that she had a right to re-appeal. The trial was to preserve her credibility and to allow her to rejoin the accused in the events of the trial. While not all late disclosure will prejudice a mens rea defence, the respondent took positive steps to place her knowledge and intent at issue. She agreed to have the video tape statement go in without contest and to testify if her motion to dismissal at the end of the Court’S case were unsuccessful. At an early stage, she entered into specific agreement regarding re‑election of her method of trial, which preserved that re-vote until she had full Crown disclosure. The judge was aware that the respondent had not made full answer/defence until just before trial. She made strategic arrangements to ensure that she would not be subject to the admissibility of the video evidence. She also agreed to testify at the conclusion of the court’"

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).",The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not meet the required sufficiency of claim and was not ready to defend on its own. The AGC brought a motion for summary judgement on the basis that the statement of claims disclosed by the plaintiff did not disclose a cause of action and was clearly unsustainable. HELD: The plaintiff's statement of defence was dismissed with costs.  1) The AGc did not provide clear authority for his position that the recovery pursuant to these undertakings does not require an attack on the validity of the enabling orders. The Court found that the amended statementof claim did nothing to comply with the rules. 2) The plaintiff did provide sufficient details in his statement of Claim to enable the Court to discern the basis of his claim for damages. The amendments did not add to the statement's claim.
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. They have shared parenting. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. He worked part-time and sold Pampered Chef products. Following separation, the petitioner was primarily a stay-at-home parent who earned a modest income. In May 2012, he stopped paying the mortgage, but advised in September 2012 that he would no longer contribute to the mortgage payment and would reduce the child support payments. He now sought spousal support and child tax benefit of $1,200 per month. The respondent brought a motion to have the parties have joint custody of the family home and spousals granted in October 2012. HELD: The respondent was to pay child support of $500 per month, plus spousAL and child support. The parties' s. 9(a) Guidelines for child support and spouse support are set out in Divorce Act, [1999] T.L.E. 225, [2003] TKL.220, [2005] TCCMA, and [2006] TCL. The TCCA, and the TCCL, respectively. The issues include child and spousing, child support, child care expenses, and child care and health and child expenses. The mother is to receive half of the spousousal and child child support; the father will receive half. The court reviewed the SSAG calculation and found that while the parties may have reached an agreement on seven issues, they did not reach agreement on all issues. The circumstance at hand was to be distinguished from an application to enforce settlement agreement where it is alleged that all issues have been settled. While it may be that parties in a settlement meeting reach a consensus on a number of issues, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that the girl had been fondled and eventually vaginal and anal, while her father was involved in an ongoing sexual assault investigation. Two medical doctors testified that all the complainant told her was that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. The Court dismissed the appeal. The Appeal Court concluded that the verdict of the trial judge was one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. It was probable that the complainant was not sexually molested every Friday by the appellant; it was probable, however, that the appellant was involved with a girlfriend who was close to the complainant. The trial judge's decision to grant the evidence of a social worker was not so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction."

However, she is satisfied that her claim for nannies and childcare costs is justified pursuant to s.7(1)(a) of the guidelines and theclaim for medication is justified under s. 7(1(c) ofthe guidelines. 4)The child support application was amended to include additional maintenance to cover special orextraordinary expenses and costs.  5)The petitioner was to be responsible for approximately 2/3 of these expenses.  6)The monies from the application were to be made out to the parties until May 1/97."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an Aboriginal rights defence. HELD: The Crown's motion was granted. The issues were set out in the following ways: 1) The trial judge failed to consider the Aboriginal right of fish for commercial purposes; 2) The Crown failed to take into account the fact the respondents were Metis and did not establish that they were hunting for food to feed themselves or their families; 3) The Court found the accused not guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had established. It is open to the accused to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginalright to fish For Commercial purposes as well as to make out all the charges against them. 4) The defence counsel for the accused served notice of the constitutional question they intended to raise on behalf of the accused on the Attorney General. The notice identified their aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada and included references to s. 91(24) and 146 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Order passed pursuant a s. 146. 5) The acquittals based on the constitutional argument were apprised of the change in the Crown's position. The accused made it known to the Crown from the outset that they would also be offering a constitutional defence in which they claimed their aboriginal rights to fish were infringed by the Saskatchewan Fishing Regulations. They were doing so in a manner consistent with their Aboriginal right. The proper characterization of the aboriginal right was that the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purpose. The Court concluded that commercial fishing was not an issue in this case and ordered the defence to revise their Brief in light of the issue."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving.

The voir de dire concluded that statements made made pursuant the HighwayTraffic Act could not have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. A new trial in the Provincial Court was ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)Had there been a voir dure, a different conclusion was reached (and possibly a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voir net in order to establish the Charter argument, a conviction would have resulted as well.  3)Had all the Charter matters been properly raise and arguedbefore the learned judge, then a conclusion a different from that reached (by solely on the application) would have yielded.  4)Had these Charter issues properly raised, and arguedde the trial judge a conclusion that different from what she reached (beneath the application to common law concepts of voluntariiness) could have resulted, a similar conclusion different in that one reached by the common law doctrines of voluntaristiness and voluntarily in the criminal proceedings against the appellant."

The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing price of $120,000). Border Credit Union opposed the application. The defendant had no further interest in the property and was not served with the application.(1) After a decree noisi of foreclosures had issued, the defendant, Border Credit, applied to the court for possession. The registered owners have had ample since their separation to resolve their family property dispute. The foreclosure proceedings have been in progress for six months.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the trial court judge erred in sentencing the appellants to a fine for the offences committed. The maximum fines prescribed by the Criminal Code are $750,000 and the total sentence was $69.000. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' on the charge of obstruction of the court."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: There was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments of the previous two trial dates. The Court found the accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge had affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. The remaining delay is either attributable to both the Crown and the accused or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The court found prejudice to the the accused outweighs the public interest in having her tried for the charge. The just and appropriate remedy under s24 of the Charter is a stayof proceedings."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of the children and share parenting of the two children approximately equally. The respondent asked the court to vary based on the former wife's RRSP income, which was a recurring income figure over the past four years, leaving net overpayment of $494 for the two months. The court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that judgment or the terms under the Corollo Relief Judgment, as there were changes of circumstances since the granting of the last variation order. The applicant had withdrawn her RRSP Income in the four years prior to the application which was not appealed. The Corollaries Relief judgment does not apply to this application. The application is dismissed."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.",The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The applicants have been unsuccessful in this application. The court found enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave to appeal. The issue of urgency is the time between resolution of the action and the appeal. It is not in the interests of justice to strike the action for delay.
8_2011skpc3.txt,"The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.

The Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all charges.  1) The accused had not been informed of his right to choose counsel until after the conclusion of the voir dire evidence. 2) The officer was in a rush and did not give any time or attention to what matters he had specifically been read by the officers at the scene, but paid better attention to their comments once they attended at the Police Services building. The accused indicated that he had not seen any lawyer. 3) The evidence was excluded on the basis that the accused had asked to contact Legal Aid duty counsel. The officer did not refer to Legal Aid as a lawyer. 4) The Court was not satisfied that the officer had not specifically asked the accused if he was satisfied with the consultation with Legal Aid and that he was not seeking to contact another lawyer. The Court could not conclude that the second count was the result of the officer's questioning of the accused."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the penitentiary for the past several years. While the applicants have framed their application under the pretence of habas corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. These remedy fall within exclusive jurisdiction through a review process by the Federal court. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of the pen. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Hearsay that the applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning Sinobert's physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinober't during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. 3) The court has not established a constraint on the access and availability of materials for the Court to review the application guised as a habea corpus application."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (DOW). In 1990, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. She now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. The Court is of the view that the connection between the silicone implants and her condition was caused by negligence attributed to the manufacturers of the breast implant. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs of the application in any event of the cause. 1)Dow Chemical was at law responsible for the liabilities of Dow Corring. The defendant was found to have breached its duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast prostheses. There was also an allegation of link between the alleged failure to disclose and the plaintiff's injuries. 2)DOW Chemical was found liable for the breast cancer and its damages. There were allegations of negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the implants and in the carrying-out of the task they were in reality one and the same entity. The plaintiff alleged that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of the defendant Corning Corporation should be treated as being those of the Dow Chemical Company. 3)The statement of claims did disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendants, the Dow chemical company and there was a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The applicant took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her deceased husband's net income rather than on his gross income. She appealed the decision to Queen's Bench. HELD: The death benefit was set aside and the estate's insurer was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefits to her as a surviving spouse and for two dependent children in accordance with the directions of the Queen's Court. 1)The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $603.25 per week for 14 days. 2)The interpretation suggested by SGI was appropriate when calculating the benefit for dependent children was incorrect.

Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The accused was wearing a mask and was speeding when the accident occurred. He was stopped for a traffic light, but failed to lock his brakes and collided with a pedestrian. The pedestrian was killed and the accused was convicted of dangerous driving. HELD: The accused is sentenced to imprisonment in the community for 90 days. 1)The accused is prohibited from driving in the city. 2)The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed. 3)The evidence did not support the accused's guilty plea. The Court found that he should have been sentenced to more time on probation. 4)The court sentenced him to probation for two years. 5)The principles of general deterrence, specific deterrence, denunciation and rehabilitation were met."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner;(b)rests the respondent from releasing any monied monies that he has received in relation to the action; and(c)restrorbs the respondent's solicitors from releasing and paying any of the monies received in connection to the Action against the Attorney-General.HELD: The respondent's application was allowed. The court imposed a restraining order on the petitioner, restraining her from receiving any monying in relation thereto, and on any other monies in relationto the action against the AG. The respondent argued that the ex partee order was unnecessary and should terminate. He also argued that a preservation order would be appropriate. The Court compared the wording of s. of the Act with s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1997. The wording of the legislation is similar to those in other statutes. The only difference is that the respondent has never had assets of significant value and the court agrees that it has insufficient evidence upon which it could reasonably conclude that if he acquired substantial funds that he would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family. The evidence establishes that the petitioner has never been given any monial assistance. The petitioner agrees that the evidence establishes the respondent hasn't been given much evidence uponwhich it could possibly conclude that the appellant would somehow squander his money without regard to his moral and legal support obligations. The appellant argues that a reserve order granted under s5(1)(a)would be sufficient security for the claim under the Act. HELD: 1)The respondent was granted an ex-parte order pursuant to s. 7(2) of the Family Maintenance act which: (a)retains the respondentfrom releasing or receiving monies; (b)remains the appellant from disposing of any of them in relation/to the Action or any claim against the attorney-general pending the petitioner's application or further court order; (c)represents the respondent with the most assets; (d)restricts the appellant's ability to dispose of any monys that he received in the action or any claims against the lawyer general pending the application or any court order respecting the respondent; (e)removes any assets which may be a source of a source for wasting or improper disposal; (f)"
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants ask that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The defendant also seeks an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs. Much of the defendants’ client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants, who could be liable to the accounting firm, to the defendants in the business of the plaintiff corporation, to which the plaintiffs are entitled.  1) The plaintiffs have developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This venture requires secrecy. Disclosure would jeopardise the defendants ability to prove that the defendants are not breaching their contract of employment. The plaintiffs are required to disclose documents pertaining to Wolff. 2) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the Queen’s Bench Rules have been silent on the issue of disclosure. The Court concluded that the exemption from disclosure for certain documents relating to Wolffe’ past salary and other information relevant to the plaintiff’ s claim was unnecessary because the information would be relevant only to the claim of damages.  3) The defendants were granted their application to have the plaintiffs claim severed so that the threshold issues of liability and damage could be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issues of damages and production and discovery. The application was dismissed. 4) The court found no order as to costs."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. The affidavit of the mortgage agent was filed in support of the application. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. On a renewed application for confirm of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the court any offers received.

9_2009nssc420.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance. The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police. When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and use or threatened use of weapon. The police had been aware that the accused had not been cooperative witness to them since the assault. The accused had made three statements during the course of his detention, one of which was that he wished to have legal counsel now. The Crown sought admission of the other statements made by the accused during the detention, alleging that he wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The defence argued that the officer had been advised of his right to counsel without delay and that he should have taken more time to make that decision. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The court found that the trial judge's remarks concerning the 'time out' component of the Charter did not indicate a state of disrepute. The Court found that this was a different situation than those involving guns and narcotics. This was an absolute fundamental right to get advice from counsel before making a statement to the police. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. It would be egregious to allow admission of this videotaped statement into evidence."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should be convicted both of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. The Court stated that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Code. As well, the Court questioned whether the Fayant had the requisite Intent to sustain conviction under s.(e)burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) of Criminal Code that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and control of the vehicle. He found that the accused rebutched the presumption by definition that the officer who occupies a driver's position is deemed as having care and Control. He adopted the reasoning of Green P.C.J. who found that although the appellant was planning on resting and sleeping for a number of hours before driving to Manitoba, he did not occupy the driver’s seat for the purpose of setting his vehicle in motion. 2) The evidence at the third trial was conclusive that the respondent rebutled the presumption that the individual who occupies or acts in the driver-s seat is considered to have 'care and control' of the Vehicle. The trial court found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the trial judge rebutting the presumption so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. 3) The Court reviewed the relevant factors and found that, in the circumstances of the case, the appellant had care and controlled of the car. The only thing that affected the decision was the appellant’ s. 813 decision. The appellant rebuking the presumption and rebuting the conclusion that the 2008 amendments to s258(1(c)(iii) were retrospective and as such, applied to this charge. The accused rebuked the presumption, just barely, that the defendant was in actual care or Control. The evidence, including the Intoxilizer results and the results of the roadside testing, was sufficient to conclude he was in care or controlling of the motor vehicle at the time of the offence. 4) The appellant was simply mistaken as to his amount of alcohol consumed that day or was deliberately misleading the Court in an attempt to defeat this charge, for these reasons do not accept his evidence as to consumption and do not find it to be capable of evidence to the contrary. 5) The only conclusion drawn"

The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which held that the judge had erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.

If the severance pay is additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to the extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship, then it should not be shareABLE. 2)The judge was of the opinion that if the severances package represented future wages for 20.5 months from the date of termination, then from that date (September 1990) to the cessation of the marriage relationship, it would not be proportionate. 3)The court was unable to find any basis upon which to change the disposition."

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant appealed a jury trial decision which awarded damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The defendant was found liable for $409,251.18. The trial judge allowed the appellant's evidence under the 'guise of expert opinion' evidence, but restricted the evidence on the basis that the plaintiff's future loss of income was so high that it was perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in law in admitting the evidence of Kalesnikoff as expert evidence, and in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesikoff. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge was correct in finding that the evidence was inadequate. The jury was permitted to consider the present value of the earnings, but they were not permitted to assess the future loss as an 'expert opinion' testimony. 2)The judge was not denying the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. The evidence was so limited as to be irrelevant. 3)The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $425,937.18 plus pre-judgment interest of $16,686 for a total of $424,960.00. 4)The award for impaired earning capacity was restricted to the amount assessed for past loss of earnings. 5)The appellant was awarded special damages of 5% which were equivalent to the award of $5,553.18 for the loss of homemaking. 6)The court rejected the appellant on the grounds that the jury was not properly instructed on the use of the approved discount rate and the evidence extended beyond the scope of the expert's evidence."

The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper.

The reason given for the dismissal was that the company had not properly enforced its overtime policy. The plaintiffs had been complaining for several years about the abuse of breaks and overtime.

The court found that the defendant had not proven that the plaintiff was not entitled to a pay day or a reasonable explanation for his dismissal.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails.

It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant appealed its conviction for selling tobacco to a youth contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum.  2)The Executions Act states that interest runs 'from the time of entering judgment' and not from the time that it is entered. The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant’s anticipated needs. This was not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. 3)Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. The jurisprudence is clear that a successful party to litigation who is free of blame should not be required to bear the costs associated with the action. However, the length of time to trial and the number of interim applications are partially attributable to the applicant who continued to make exaggerated claim for the whole of the testator’ s estate well past the time when it was appropriate. This contributed to the respondent’’ unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the Estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded."

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.

b_2000skqb539.txt,"An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds. The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses. The horse that won was disqualified for interference at the gate. The applicants applied for judicial review. Application allowed; decision quashed; the parties' interpretation of the evidence adduced at a hearing was not part of the record. The parties' application for judicial leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that the parties had not breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. It ordered the Commission to immediately notify the applicants of the objection and the opportunity to make submissions."

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The Agency had previously been aware that the mother was neglectful and used corporal punishment as a method of disciplining them. The children had been out of their mother's care for several months and had to be placed in the temporary care of the Agency. The mother had recently lost her second child, S.M., who had been diagnosed with Head Lice. The agency had since concluded that the neglect was attributable to the mother and not the child's natural environment. The child had had several previous adverse events, including a head lice infestation. The father had since been advised by the Agency that the children were in need of protective services and that the Agency had provided some essential provisions. The three children had to remain in the permanent care Of the Agency with access to the Agency Director and the Agency worker. The permanent care application was granted for four children, with the first child to remain with the Agency and the second child to be with the agency. The assessment was held in relation to S.D. The issues before the Court were the nature of the child and her physical health and well-being. The protection affidavit stated that the child had a slight five code type and her anger was caused by the mother's use of corporal punishments. The Court was at a loss to see how that would have an effect on any determination that had to make, or that he had to have made, with regard to the three children."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for interim judicial disclosure on the grounds the accused was in the community awaiting trial. The Crown applied for a determination of preliminary issues including whether the Youth Court judge in the Provincial court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for judicial interim release; whether the Provincial Office judge had jurisdiction in the matter as provided in the Young Offender’’ Act; and whether the youth court judge in a Provincial Court had jurisdiction as a Youth Court Judge in the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The accused was granted interim judicial custody. The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offenders Act had been dealt with by Madam Justice Pardu in R. v. M.R. [2001] O.J. No. 2598.

Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent SGI as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as defined by it as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. The appellant is entitled to an income replacement benefits based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. HELD: The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. His employment income for the first 180 days was greater or less than the IRB calculated under s. 116 of the act and received by the appellant in the first 179 days after the accident. The Court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the First 180 days. The application for the payment of IRB for the 181st day and subsequent days is dismissed. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRBs for the 1st 180 days and for the 182 days and therefore for the whole 180 day period. 2) The legislation strives for one's earning truth. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average approach'. If a non earner has proved on a balance of probabilities that the promised employment reflects his earning reality, a poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earn reality. 3) The Court accepts that the respondent's evidence that his operation continues in inclement weather is not enough to determine the time that the applicant would have actually been employed. The issue is determining the time at which the appellant would have been employed and that finding has been made."
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. The primary residence was with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support but expressed concern that the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. Joint custody awarded; the matrionial home was divided equally; the children were to have exclusive possession of the matron home. The matrimony was evident as the children had moved from Canada to the United States and enjoyed the benefit of a large family. The father was to have sole possession of all the matrons' property and the matriconial home would be divided equally. The wife's position was that she always wanted to study divinity and the children would have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. She did not require any special or extraordinary expense. The history of the family and the fact that the wife had significant financial support during the marriage did not disqualify her from receiving spousals. The children were awarded the matrilineal home valued at $50,000. The Matrimonial Home as a Matrimonial Asset was divided as follows: 1) Piano lessons and musical instruments are extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities and are necessary and reasonable; 2) The mother was to give notice of the activity and the cost. 3) The matriol home was owned by the father and was owned and operated by his parents. The family owned and operates a rental property and was in the commonwealth. The husband was to pay child support of $650 per month for three years. The daughter was to receive spousa in the amount of $1,000 per month. 4) The Matrionial Home was clearly a matrimononial asset and must be divided as described in the Guidelines. The principles of fundamental fairness and the principles of fairness in division of assets were considered. The court found no evidence that the parents posed a flight risk to the children. The fact that both parents were deeply settled into their local community and the family values were at the forefront of their lives. The Court awarded the wife significant financial relief. The child was to retain the matridonial home and the mother was granted spouso in the sum of $50 per month to cover the cost of the tuition at Atlantic. The judge found that the mat"

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revved. At the time his driver's licence was revoked, he was convicted of driving a vehicle on a highway while revoked, which was the charge before the court. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATT on the road. The words 'all terrain vehicle' are used within the words of s. Motor Vehicle Act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. The use of an ATX on public highways is clearly prohibited under the Motor Vehicle act. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV on the highways because it was a prohibited vehicle and it was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the daughters were no longer children of the marriage and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied to have the Court of Appeal disincentivize the daughters from receiving maintenance in the amount of $3,644. He found that there was no agreement in 1997 to pay specified or other maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive maintenance. The trial judge found that the daughter had not withdrawn from the father’s charge and that they were still entitled to maintenance. He also found that, based on the evidence, the daughter was not in arrears of maintenance in September 2006 and that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $3 million. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of appeal found that even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met. The court found that it was not possible to find that the father was in arreavent or that he was in breach of the terms of the Divorce Act. Even if the daughter’ s. 2(b) of the Act was found to be in error, the Court found that this finding was supported by the evidence. The fact that the mother had not taken steps to obtain information about the daughters’ educational needs and to provide for them, despite incurring a series of salary decreases, did not necessarily mean that the girls were no now children of this marriage. The issue of unilateral withdrawal was also supported by evidence."

He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

The appellant sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed. He submitted that the information is nullity and should not be quashed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the appeal could not succeed because the appellant had not yet learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. It was not necessary for the trial judge to deal with the first three counts because the information could not be severed. The appeal must be dismissed.

He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.",HELD: The plaintiff was found to be defamed and his reputation was seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The defendants were found to have breached the plaintiff's qualified privilege by publicly disclosing the grievance to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). The plaintiff sought damages and costs. He was awarded judgment. The court accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The plaintiff had proven that he was defamed. The Court accepted the defence of the defendants in a provisional order for damages. The cause of action was the breach of the plaintiff’s duty of care and protection of the confidential information contained in the grievance. The defendant was found liable.

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"Civil Procedure – Custody and Access – Affidavits – AdmissibilityCivil Procedure - Affidavit – Admitting Admissible Evidence – Settlement Planning – Objection to AdmissivityCivil Procedure– Affidavitation – Admissible Evidence – Adoption – Admissions – Judgment The respondent exhibited a letter to the petitioner's counsel that was from his counsel to the respondent's counsel. It was marked 'Without Prejudice' and read 'With a Praying Eye' in it read 'with a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement'. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could later be used to their detriment. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on a proposal he made because it is not his to waive. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. Costs can be pursued with vigour after trial if either of the parties is of such mind."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1988-89, c. S-17.1 provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce is suspended on the application for an order pursuant to s. 11(1) of the Farm Security legislation.  1) The applicant asks the registration be discharged. The reason the legislature provided a suspension in s. 22 of the Act is because the limitation periods have substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention. Once the suspension is suspended, the notice of intent is deemed to have expired. This absurd result would not flow just to the respondent in its unique circumstances. Acceptance of the respondent's interpretation of the legislation would lead to a situation where any and all mortgagees of farm lands could entirely avoid any limitation period applying to their mortgage by the simple devise of serving notice of intentions under the Farm security Act. 2) The Limitations Act requires debtors and contractual obligees to commence enforcement proceedings within the applicable limitation period, failing which the right to enforce was lost. The legislature could not have intended what the respondent argues. The purpose of the farm security act is to prevent mortgagees from foreclosing on farmers who have a reasonable possibility of and who are making sincere and reasonable effort to meet their obligations. The Farm Security acts provide for a three-year limitation period running from the date of registration to the date that notice of intend is served. The time for making an application is deemed over and the limitation is deemed in the time period set out in the Limitations act. 3) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the Limitation of Actions Act does not apply to mortgagees. The Limitation Act provides that notice to the borrower in the period leading up to the issuance of the notice. The Court found that it would be manifest injustice to mortgagee if the three- year limitation period had expired and the resulting notice of action was deemed to be invalid. The applicant was awarded the taxable costs of her application against the respondent."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applied for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and to have spousal support reduced to an amount equivalent to that of the arrears made in the original order. He relied on s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: The respondent was awarded child support based on an income of $150,000. The petitioner opposed the application to completely discontinue the child and spousals support obligation and further for all support arrearages to be expunged. The respondent had paid little towards either the court order or his obligation, and had been in arreary for the past few years. The Court held that it was appropriate to vary the support order based on the respondent's ability to pay. The court found that the respondent had failed in his onus for the years 2005 through to, and including, 2012. The arrearing from 2005 through was adjusted to accord with the income as found in the order. The reasonableness issue was raised as was the respondent’s failure to provide adequate support in the areas of employment, health, and education which had impacted his ability to continue to earn an income. The issue of whether the support obligation should be varied to reflect a lower income, as imputed in the earlier order, was a question of relevance."
c_1992canlii2468.txt,"The appellant insurer appealed a decision dismissing its claim that the respondent conspired with her sister and brother-in-law to have her cottage intentionally burned. The appellant asserted the respondent acted fraudulently by failing to make full disclosure of the facts surrounding the cause of loss. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent did not wilfully make any false statement, and answered all questions as required on the documents provided. Her silence in the face of uncertainty over her in-laws involvement in the fire did not constitute fraud. If the appellant expects an insured to comply with statutory conditions, it must reproduce them in the policy and provide a question on the proof of loss form to that effect.","The appellant claimed payment of $20,000 plus expenses associated with investigating and adjusting the loss. The trial judge found that the appellant did not know whether or not her brother-in-law had arranged the fire and therefore did not constitute fraud or wilful fraud. The appellant contended the trial judge erred in finding that the respondent did not commit fraud and that coverage under the insurance policy was vitiated pursuant to Statutory Condition 7. The respondent did, however, make a false statement to the trial court as she did not disclose the conversations with her sister. The appeal was dismissed with costs of $1,200. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judgment did not erred on the evidence. Statutory Conditions and inscriptions do not supersede or replace the fact that a loss is caused by the loss, and that the failure to disclose the discussions with her sisters a central point of the proof of loss does not constitute a fraud or a wilful false statement."

The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","This was an application by the applicant for an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for certiorari in aid. Dismissing the application, that there was evidence before the trial judge upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting judicially could convict the accused of first degree murder. The evidence before trial was that the accused had told the trial Judge that she would hit the deceased with a baseball bat and stab him in the head.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

It is the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the CapeBreton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The Cape Bretons have never been required to pay the rent of the buildings from outside the Church and, because of the failure to follow the Education Act, the Province is not required to provide buildings for the service of the public school program."

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","The plaintiff insurer, which represented the defendant defendant, failed to disclose the existence of a second insurance policy under which the plaintiff obtained a cancellation notice of cancellation. The defendant insurer, Marsh, had previously placed a policy on the plaintiff which protected her interests and the interests of the mortgagee. The plaintiff commenced foreclosure proceedings against the defendant insurer after the fire. The defendants were in receipt of the notice of cancelation when the fire occurred. The property was vacant and had been totally destroyed by fire. When the fire happened, the defendant insurance company, which had placed the policy on her premises, notified the plaintiff insurer of the impending foreclosure action. The insured suffered loss of $100,000. The mortgagee was in arrears at the time of the fire and had received notice that the policy was cancelled. The insurance company did not pay any of the $100k. The defence argued that the failure of the defendant to disclose this policy to the plaintiff's insurer raised the bar to a certain level of moral and ethical conduct. Dismissing the application, that the standard of proof in this case was on the balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court found that the defendant breached its contractual obligation to insure the plaintiff against creditors. As a result of the foreclosure action, the insurer was forced to foreclose on the property. The Court also considered the individual circumstances of the plaintiff and found that since the policy had been placed with the plaintiff, she was not adversely affected by any misrepresentation on the part of the insurer."

No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence.

c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol.

Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value.

Appeal allowed; sentence to be set aside; probation to be imposed for the offence of theft of property exceeding $5,000. The appellant's father was given leave to file affidavit evidence. The affidavit evidence was inadequate.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether the plaintiff was constructially dismissed as a result of changes unilaterally made by the defendant in the terms of her employment, and whether there was constructive dismissal. HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her last employment with the defendant, plus vacation pay at 6% per annum. 1)It is not always easy to find employment in a relatively short period of time. This was not the case in this case where the defendant made an effort to find a replacement. It was not to suggest that the plaintiff wasn't overpaid for the work that she did. Rather it seems to be due to a dirth of employment opportunities in the Truro area or an over abundance of qualified people who are willing to work at very modest rate as illustrated by the case of the respondent. 2)The plaintiff has made continuing and diligent efforts to find work. There is absolutely no question that she has been constructively dismissal. However, the appropriate period is 8 months, given the fact that she is no longer employed. 3)Given the plaintiff's previous employment history and the fact she had not been compensated for her time lost in the employment force, it was appropriate to take into account the ten months maternity leave she had taken while in the employ of the defendant prior to her being dismissed. 4)The employer bore the responsibility of providing notice of the proposed changes. The employer bore no obligation to provide further notice. 5)The Court was satisfied that the respondent had not given proper notice to the plaintiff prior to June 15, 1997. 6)The respondent was awarded costs of the action."

The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.",The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 26(2)(b) of The Farm Land Security Act. In issue was the solicitation of a letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration they had complied with requirements pursuant to s. 28 of the Act and that an order that the defendant forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs by the plaintiffs on the usualtrust conditions and that the counterclaim was dismissed. 1) The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. 2) To interpret the letter of pledge as being a letter to the effect of s27(2(b)(ii) in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgagefinancing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of refusal. 3) The defendants counterclaimed that the offer of a tender offer was not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment from recognized financial institutions. 4) Costs of the action were also discussed.

The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","The Law Society of Saskatchewan applied to the Court to determine whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The applicant lawyer had worked with the law office of a client since 1998 and had not had any contact with that client since her employment at the law school. The evidence showed that all the screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation, occurred prior to the applicant's arrival and included an implicit warning of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to. The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not received confidential information from her clients during the time she was with the firm and that there was no risk of disclosure. The screening measures were necessary to ensure that no disclosure would occur and the applicant could continue to represent her client. There was no evidence that any of the applicants had ever discussed the application with anyone within the law company or with the lawyer's counsel."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.

The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.

The farm equipment was $856.00 and the value of farm machinery at $2200. 2) The respondent sold his trailer and the proceeds were used to purchase the farm machinery. 3) The petitioner received no income for the past four years. She should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court declined to take them into account. 4) The Court weighed the oral testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner. The father stated he had no interest in any equipment owned by the respondent. He claimed that 1990 Ford F-150 truck was exempt. The Court accepted the father's testimony that he owned the tractor prior to the marriage and that it was acquired prior to his marriage. The amount of the farm equipment which the petitioner had to pay was $50,725.82. 5) The amount owing to the respondent was $12,000.00.

HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Board did not meet the standard of patently unreasonable conduct and error. While there is a magic formula in how long it may take parties to forge an agreement through collective bargaining, ratify and actually sign a agreement, there is no magic in the date that an application to the Board will be heard and decision issued. It is dependent on a number of contingencies including general application of first in first in the first place rule to the hearing of applications, availability of the parties, their counsel and of panel members, previous commitments, and intervening priorities. It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs applied for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes: Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the military, Civil or Military, or was displaced from their position by the enactment of the Canada Pension Plan Act in 1985. The plaintiffs claimed entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' pursuant to legislation enacted July 31, 2000. The statement of claim was issued in 1993. In both tort and contract, the limitation period in Ontario is 6 years. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pension that they seek. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute- barred. 1) The Court found that only if the class members succeed in this litigation and reach the bureaucratic stage of applying for the ex gratia payment will the question of individual issues arise. 2) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual to the class member. The Court should be reluctant to deny a class member his or her day in court. 3) There is no suggestion Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits. The issue at the certification stage is not whether the claim is likely to succeed but whether the suit is appropriately prosecuted as a class action. 4) There were number of issues, most of which were common and some of them were individual to class members."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge granted him a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work. He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He was 28 years old and had two young children. He deposited a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He withdrew the money five days later, depositing and withdrawing $13,000 in cash. He then returned the money 5 days later and withdrew $13k more than five days before depositing the last $13000 in a CIBC Visa account. This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court judge called a rather intricate kiting system. The total loss to CIBC was $24,000. The accused had no criminal record and had no previous criminal record. The Crown took issue with the discharge and asked that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service work. The Provincial Court granted leave to appeal and substituted a conditional sentence. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the accused was sentenced to 12 months conditional sentence with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hour of community work. He made a restitution order of $24000.00. The conditional sentence was substituted in place of the 1 year conditional sentence which he was already serving. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and 200 hours community service."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge applied the test that showed he was more than twice the legal limit, but the breath demand was stronger than the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s.253. The mechanism for doing so is the entering of a partial judicial stay (CCS253(a)). The reasonableness of the impaired charge was set aside and either an acquittal or a new trial ordered by virtue of alleged reliance by the trial judge on the readings of the breathalyzer readings. The trial decision was set against the impaired driver's conviction. The decision to set aside the conviction and the acquittal by a Provincial Court judge was also set aside in favour of a new Trial ordered by a new Court of Appeal."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had made an application for ongoing child maintenance based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The petitioner had lost her sight in 2001 and had been continuously employed part-time for the past 3 years. He had changed employment in order to contribute to his own support and had ceased to be a person in the meaning in the Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from the mother's charge or to obtain the necessaries of life. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $181 per month for child maintenance. The reasonableness of the choice and the means and needs of the child and parent is discussed."

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in Bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcies. The Trustee was appointed as Trustee In bankruptcy. The former retained the former as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the premises. The latter was unable to gain possession of the premises and the Trustee applied for an interim injunction. The applicant refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an injunction. Ordering the defendant have possession of all the property and to pay reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the assets, the defendant was granted a summary judgment. The defendant argued that the pleading requirements of the Trustees was simply a way to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence, claiming damages for the injuries suffered by two of the plaintiffs. Both were paid damages for their injuries. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The plaintiff now claimed damages for damages for injuries sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of the defendant in the design and manufacture of the vehicle. The defendant motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both Steven and Jody Johansson were dismissed. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and driving while over.breath at the roadside while over..08, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 and 253(2)(a). The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples were obtained. The accused was breath tested at 1:21 a.m. and 1:41 a.M. The officer who stopped the accused and found him to be in good health took the opportunity to tell the accused that his lawyer was available. The defence argued that the accused had expressed dissatisfaction with his call to Legal Aid and that the officer should have provided a 'Prosper' warning to the accused before proceeding to take samples of breath. HELD: The accused's right to counsel was not breached. 1)The removal of the accused's cell phone from its location did give pause for thought in that the offence had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it was clear from the evidence that the defendant made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police to provide the accused with a warning. 2)The accused's rights to counsel were not breached under s. 10(b). 3)The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused’s rights under s10(b) of Criminal Code.  4)The Court could not have found any other evidence of the Crown’ s3(b)(i) or s2(b); or the Certificate of Accrediting. 5)The evidence was not conclusive, but the accused was not guilty of either.  6)The absence of any evidence of legal advice could not and could not been obtained under s3.

c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of the employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a small pit in a grain terminal. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in a receiving pit. The accused had not yet received hands-on training on how the safety procedure was implemented. The evidence of the incident was found to be buried in a large amount of photos, drawings and words. The court was unsure about the accuracy and reliability of the accused's evidence. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to insure the health of an employee. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failing in his duty to ensure employee health and health. The facts were found to rest on the testimony of several witnesses. The trial judge was not satisfied that the Crown failed to adequately instruct the employee on how and when to ununplug a large pit in the grain terminal and failed to ensure that the employee was made aware of the hazard. The matter was remitted to the Court of appeal."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The defence argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the accused was driving slowly and in a manner that created a danger to the complainant and her young daughter. The offence was committed between spouses where minor incidental physical contact can be expected and where minor motor vehicle activity is nothing more than de minimis non curat lex and is not worthy of criminal sanction. The trial judge also found that the appellant intentionally drove in a way which created a dangerous situation for others, and drove in such a manner as to scare the complainant. The Court also questioned the trial court judge's decision in favour of the accused on dangerous drive. The appellant argued that she should have been more alert and aware of the danger to herself and her daughter when she noticed the accused. Appeal dismissed; the trial trial judge's conclusion was that the offence was between spouses and was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver. While a departure from a standard of care expected of an experienced driver in similar circumstances is a departure, but not a marked one from that of a prudent driver, the trial justice was entitled to discount the appellant's deference in her assessment of the evidence."

For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole, in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, because it was unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent and it was an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor. Matrimony Home The parties in their separation agreement indicated that they assumed $60,000 of matrimonial assets at the time of separation. The wife argued that it was entered into under duress or undue influence of her husband or alternatively that the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it is unconscible to bind her to such a level. Matrionial Property Law – Matrimonial Property – Divorce Act, Nova Scotia – Matriarchy – Property – Retirement Home The Matrimonian Property Act is a separate Act and the divorce judgment was granted based on the finding that there were no factors that had been established under s13 of the Act to warrant other than an equal division of matrionial assets. Matrilonial Property – Matrononial Property - Property – Pension The matrimony home was valued at $60 million at the date of separation and the value of the mortgage as of the date it was executed was $28,257.01. The matriolonial property law - matrimonious division in the wife's favour - was not an issue to be tried in a divorce proceeding.

Matrices - Matrices, which denote assets in the family, were not subject to the Matron of Matrimons Act.

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention.

It is clear that the Review Board exists as a final, specialized forum in which matter of complaint against police officer or internal discipline is fully heard de novo before an independent decision making body.

HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant knew the plaintiff did not supply a basement and therefore there was no agreement to pay interest. 2)The plaintiff was not awarded judgment for the extras. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and there was not agreement reached by the parties to pay.  4)The claim for rectification was dismissed on the basis that the plaintiff misrepresented the price of the RTM. The evidence was inconclusive as the defendant had not explicitly stated that an RTM did not come with a basement.  5)The Court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events. The Court cannot accepted the plaintiff’s conversion of events into a sales pitch. The sales pitch was set out in the contract. The defendants had prepared a detailed price for the RTMs. The contract was prepared in a format that incorporated the price for basement. It was not possible to attribute the difference between the bid and bid sheets.  6)The only evidence that the defendants knew the price was $106,000 was not found to be inconsistent with the claim for fixedification. 7)The court was not satisfied that there was an agreement reached between the parties. The claim for error was dismissed for rectified."
d_1997canlii11230.txt,"The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied. Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","Paterson Sons appealed an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to a resolution by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, retained an arbitrator, agreed on an arbitrators arbitrator and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator's award was favourable in most respects to the position taken by the respondent. The issue was whether the arbitrator made the correct decision on the evidence presented. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for costs on a party and party basis was denied. 1)The findings of the arbitrators with which the appellant takes issue were not questions of law but rather questions of fact. The appellant's submission refers extensively to the evidence presenting to the arbitration arbitrator. It constitutes in effect an invitation to the court to retry the case that was heard and determined by the arbitrated arbitrator as well.  2)There was some evidence upon which the arbitrating arbitrator could make a finding of fact, but there was no provision in the arbitration terms of theContract to Arrange Award. The appeal court could not delve into the evidence to attempt to determine whether or not the arbitrations findings of fact are'supported' by the evidence or are 'contradicted' by evidence."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under The Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Widents' relief Act however they did put in place an order which would have the effect of reducing the estate's ability to support the children. HELD: The child was to be allocated equally with the other child. 1)The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. 2)The children were to receive their share of the estate upon attaining the age twenty-five years.  3)The terms of the Will were not to be given as a whole other than its ordinary meaning with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.  4)The application for relief was dismissed.

She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. Appeal allowed; the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA. The sentence continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. The Youth Court Judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision in the YCP. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the Youth Courts is the same as that of the SCC in R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.) and confirmed in various other cases including R. vs. M.D.S. 45 at 1:00. 2) The Youth Courts are not separate jurisdictions. The SCC judge focused underemphasized the use of s. 103 as an expression of her decision. The decision is based on the SGC in Rizzo Rizzoli. The youth justice court judge reviewed the matter in s. 106 and, in November 2004, the provincial directed issued a detention and supervision warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Police located and arrested the youth on November 4, 2004. The director concluded that the matter was serious and remanded the respondent pending review by the Youth court pursuant to s103. The Provincial Director then issued a search warrant for the apprehension and the apprehension the young individual. The search warrant was issued for the young offender. The young person was found not to be serving his sentence during the time between the issuance of the warrant and the arrest. The detention and custody supervision warrant is granted in s102(2)(b) and, after a review by a Youth Court Court Judge, the young applicant is remanded in custody. The Court of Appeal does not accept the Crown's argument that the Youth Centre judge erroded s. 2(1)(b). The Youth court judge focused on the use and application of s102 and the wording of s103 and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of sentence"

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions of the Board's case management division and appeals committee. HELD: The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. 1) The Court found that the impugned decisions were not part of the original decision and that they were not contrary to s. 64(2) of The Workers' Compensation Act. 2) The applicant was entitled to an order pursuant to the terms of the legislation as provided for in the Act. The Court reviewed the relevant decision of the medical review panel and the decision of its appeals committee and found that there was no jurisdiction for the Board to exercise its prerogative power and quash certioraris. 3) The Board did not create a clarification or addendum to its decision or reasons by simply responding to the letter from the applicant's counsel. In that response there was nothing. 4) The appeal available to the applicant was not limited to points of law and so on appeal the Board members would be able to consider the applicant’s issue of fact.

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.",The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. A.D. The plaintiff was in the middle of a road trip and her vehicle was struck by the police vehicle. She claimed she had to look behind her to see if the lights were on. The defendant testified that he had passed the plaintiff's vehicle at dark section of highway and he did not notice the police car approaching the intersection. He claimed the plaintiffs vehicle was in a near perfect condition and that he was not aware that the lights had been in operation. The plaintiffs claim the defendant was negligent in failing to alert the police when the accident occurred. The Court cannot accept the witness' testimony as being from the second floor of the defendants' building. The third floor of a building was also used as a storage area. The Defendants claim the plaintiff failed to observe the police vehicles approaching the accident and that they were in operation at the time the accident happened. The issue before the Court is whether the plaintiffs were contributory to the accident or negligent in failure to alert police. The evidence before the court is not reliable but based on the evidence of the witness.
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been obtained that indicated that the applicant had filed a HST return in 2001. The applicant claimed the accountant had given him misleading and misleading information. He alleged that he was advised by the accountant that the accountants were considered fully taxable supplies with respect to HST sale in accordance to the Excise Tax Act. The accountant claimed he was dismissed as a result of the tax investigation. He demanded the return of the documents. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the informant's evidence did not rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home. The nature of the breach was not difficult to understand. The standard of credibly based probability envisions practical, non-technical and common sense probability as to the existence of the facts and inferences asserted. Without denying the potential seriousness of these allegations, they fell well below the level that reasonable and likely grounds for an arrest warrant to be issued. The informant's information was found to be in error. The facts did not support reasonable apprehension of bias. The fact that the documents were found at the plaintiff's place of business and in any storage facilities occupied by the plaintiff and her husband did not raise the level which justified a search of the applicant’s home."
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having care and control of a motor Vehicle contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of that Code. The only issue on which the defence requested briefs was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of either offence. Although his driving was in poor condition and he was in the driver's seat when the breath demand was read, there was little danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public. The accused's acts did not involve the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. The Court concluded that there was no danger of driving being set into the wall of an adjacent building."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services (MSA) sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The father asked that the children be returned to him directly but the mother opposed him. The mother argued that the father should continue living with the mother and take anger management courses, take anger Management courses and take a anger management course. The issues were: 1) the father's responsibility to get the children into the proper care of the mother; 2) the evidence was conclusive that the parents had not been in contact with the child for the past four years; and 3) the children's history was inconclusive as the father had admitted to using cocaine and marijuana in the past few months. The evidence showed that the mother had been in the hospital for most of her life; the father was in the military; and the children had not responded to any of the parenting services offered to the mother. HARD: The evidence was inconclusively negative. The parents had signed a PSA agreeing that the child would not be exposed to drug use, alcohol or violence, that the family would remain drug free and remain drug-free for the duration of the child's life; that the evidence did not support the father’s position on the grounds that the youth had been involved in domestic violence; and that the young child should not be subjected to the violence of his parents. HOLD: The children were in the care of their mother and her family for most years. The child was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born; the mother was apprehended at birth as was the father. The children had been placed in the permanent care of a social worker for six months in October 2007. The permanent wardhip application was filed in January 2008 and the father indicated that he would continue to reside with the mom for the next four years. HAND: The permanent wardship application for both of the children was denied. The long term custody agreement for both the children and the permanency committee was terminated in September 2008. The permanency agreement was amended in October 2008 to include an order for the father to attend parenting classes, participate in and complete parenting instruction, participate with the Harm Reduction Methadone Program and provide drug screens.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to serve pre-certification notice to all persons who had booked a vacation through the defendant to a resort in Cuba. The plaintiffs also sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre- certification notice. The plaintiff seeks to have that defendant direct it to provide the information of the nine property owners who have, to date, received the package. 2) The plaintiff is not seeking to compel the defendant by any means to produce a list of proposed class members. The only thing that could lead to further motions is the examination of witnesses. 3) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 4) The wording of the affidavit is novel. The affidavit was written for the purpose of providing the plaintiff with a list. The examination may end up being more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt via the defendant at getting information from the plaintiff as to other customers who may have booked through the defendants' office. The examining may be more broad- ranging than the defendant could possibly attempt to get information from other customers that may have been booked through her office. 5) The defendant has had over the last couple of years ample opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through some lawful manner and the Court will not be suspending its jurisdiction in this matter. The Court will continue to look into the complexities of pre certification examination of witness. 6) The application for examination of the plaintiff's affidavit is dismissed."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. The mother was working and living in Hawaii and was taking medication. The father was working part-time and was disabled. The wife was living with her father and was still going to school. The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage, although she testified that she was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. Both were experiencing health problems and the wife had recently lost her position at a food store. She had sold her house, used the proceeds to spend over 4 months out of Canada, living in the USA part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the one year spousals maintenance order had expired and only a few days prior to the hearing of her application. Prior to the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousousal maintenance, she had lost the position and filed no medical evidence to indicate she was unable to work, did not, in fact, say that she could not work, and indicated that she intended to work. She was seeking a full time position. Both had children, aged 60 and 53. The trial judge imputing an income of $15,289 per month based on an assumption she could work 30 hours a week at a minimum wage and did nothing to indicate that she had not been physically or emotionally exhausted. The evidence established that the wife was still relatively young and could do some work but her earning potential was still modest and she had made no effort to obtain employment. Both the mother and the daughter were living abroad and were receiving social assistance. The order of Sandomirsky J. was permanent and no further review was fixed. The appeal was allowed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court found that the Court's order for spousa support in light of the judgment of Otten"

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application.

HELD: Rather than filing an appeal, the respondent should have pursued a remedy in Queen's Bench. The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence. The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back to Court if the appellant is unsuccessful at Queen's Bench.",The proposed appellant filed a Notice of Appeal alleging certain facts with respect to why the order ought not to have been made. The proper procedure for the appellant to have followed was to return to the Court of Queen's Bench and apply pursuant to Rule 271 of the Queen's Court Rules to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of evidence. HELD: The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back before the proposed appellant on five days notice should the proposed applicant be unsuccessful in the Court Of Queen'sBench. The appellant should have pursued a remedy in the court of Queen’s Bench.
d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1) as it did in s.476.012/3. The Court of Appeal agreed with the sentencing court's interpretation of the s.502.013 (2.2.0) of The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIra compliance order which consists of a 10-year firearm prohibition, aDNA order and 20 yearSOIra Compliance order. Nothing in the Criminal code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed documents. The defence counsel disclosed the existence of the documents in the weeks immediately preceding the trial, in the absence of any Crown disclosure. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further time. The delay in access to the documents was significant as defence counsel had not been advised of the impending trial, and it was feared that the documents would contain information that could affect the trial judge's decision. The documents remained undisclosed as defence sought to adjourn the trial and sought new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge did not err in refusing to adjourn and the Crown sought leave to further review the documents. There was no breach of s. 11(d) of the Charter. The Court reviewed the case and found that the Crown had not disclosed the documents to defence counsel in sufficient detail to allow them to be examined. As the trial had been set aside and new trial ordered, the Court was in the position of the Crown counsel that it was not able to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of an order for spousal support in the amount of $10,000 per month. The order provided that the respondent would have exclusive possession of the family home and the rights to spousals. The appellant argues that the Chambers judge's conclusion that he stopped paying the bills for the family house at the end of October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him. HELD: The application is allowed. The stay is in place until the hearing of the appeal. The application to lift the stay of proceedings is allowed in respect to the enforcement of the retroactive spousa support arrears created by the January 20, 2016 interim order.

d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and had been a member for 10 years. The ICE unit investigated a number of incidents involving the accused, primarily involving the sharing of files on a shared computer. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex. The Court found that the accused had in his possession child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, and that the officer had access to the files while he was on shift. The Internet Childexploitation unit investigated three computers that were seized from the accused's residence. The first computer was a laptop computer which had the operating system encrypted so that it could not be accessed without a password. The second computer was an entirely new computer which could not possibly be accessed with a password because the internal IP of the computer was tied to that VIN number and that physical MAC address was not protected. The officer testified that he could not tell if the accused’s computer was the same one because it was communicating with other computers. The court concluded that the second computer, the one with the external IP address, was the one that was being used to access the Internet and that this particular computer could not have been accessed with the password provided by the third computer. As the ICE unit was involved, the accused was subject to search warrants issued across the province. The majority of the evidence was from individuals who had downloaded the file sharing application, including the accused. The bulk of the material was obtained through Internet Protocols (IPs). The bulk was obtained by Internet Protocol Protocols, which is a globally unique identifier, which the ICE team was able to use to monitor and monitor the Internet Protocol. The presence of these particular IPs and their connection to the Internet was a significant factor in the apprehension of the accused and his subsequent apprehension. The arrest warrant authorized a search of a duplex located within the RCMP campground. The evidence showed that the residence was occupied by a person who was viewing files on the Internet from a shared home computer and that person was accessing a different physical location. The access to that location was via an Internet Protocol (IP) protocol. The person accessing the Internet through the Internet could not access the second or third computer because the Internet protocol is a highly secure network and could not allow access to third-party files. The administration of the warrant was lifted and the accused arrested. The last computer seized was a computer which was a completely new computer"
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, was in an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide 'call out' services for the defendant's fleet of trucks and associated Equipment. The defendant initially refused to pay its invoices as they became due, and in November 2015 ceased to pay invoicing as they were due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $10,902.32. The court accepted the defendant’s evidence as it relates to the express terms of the contract. The contractual quantum meruit, or the principle of price to be paid, was established in the context of the provision of goods and services and was not an express term. The plaintiff did not ask for an exact amount but it was satisfied that the figure represented an amount in excess of what it should have been and that it had not been rebutted by the defendant. The claim that the defendant billed too much for services was dismissed. The amount awarded was reduced from $8,528.25 to $1,550.85. The Court was not satisfied that there was any evidence of detriment reliance as the defendant provided evidence that the parties agreed to charge a fair and reasonable price for the goods and products.

Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. Fossil was hired as a fund development officer by the defendants. The defendants were not called to testify. At the material time the three principal officers of the defendants' company heard evidence from the defendant that the defendant was to bring in investment capital. The defendant denied any obligation under the contract to bring investment capital and asserted that his role in the venture was confined to the area of introducing potential investors. Fossils brought the action against the defendants for breachof contract claiming $56,500. HELD: Fossil's claim was dismissed. 1)When there was a failure of a performance by the defendant in an essential part of the contract the defendants was entitled to repudiate it. When there was no failure of the defendant to bring the investment capital, the defendant is entitled to reject it. 2)The defendant was not the only person involved in the transaction. The parol evidence rule was used to disallow the use of the word 'fund development officer' in the parol agreement. When a failure is a essential part to the contract a repudiation of it is legitimized. So an order for rescission is not necessary. 3)The plaintiff was not required to testify on its allegation of breach of the undertaking.

e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year. However, in 1990 the rent was raised from $500 to $515. The landlord gave three months notice of the increase (three months written notice) to be effective May 1, 1990. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months' notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondent objected to the rental rise and made an application to the Residential Tenancies Board for determination of whether or not that increase was valid. The Board held that the three months written warning required, in the context of the standard form, to come three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the decision of the trial judge and the Board's decision, that the Act and the Rent Review Act are clear. The interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act, the Rent review Act and s. 11 of the Rent Board is clear. There is no restriction in s. of the lease as to when, during the term of the term, notice must be given. The three months minimum is required in order for a landlord to give notice of any increase in rent three months prior to the expiration of the current lease. This is not the case that the tenancy agreement did not provide for no rent increase. On the contrary, the agreement by s.11 did provide for one."

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss. 253(b) and 255(3) and driving while disqualified contrary so s. 259(4), all of Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. The Court found no evidence to support this. 2) The accused had not been properly restrained at the time of the collision. There was uncertainty concerning the time at which the accident occurred. The police were operating under very tight time lines. There had been no bad intent on the part of the officers. The conversation was not material to the trial or the charges before trial. The accused's insistence that there were two people in the cab of the truck who he said was driving was rejected. The evidence of the driver of the Sunfire and the accused's friend was found to be unreliable. 3) The trial judge was unable, in a reasonable way, to conclude that the accused was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. The trial court was unable and in a way to conclude there was a breach of fundamental justice. The officer's testimony was accepted over that of the accused."

Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

The proposal was granted a conditional variance and the building was subsequently rented out to separate groups of students. The owner sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the court in the amount of $25,000. 1)The Court found no reason why the owner should not be required to provide within fifteen days the names of all tenants and if the required period of time the manner of payment of rental should be subject to the contractual determination of the landlord and the manner in which rental should occur was in contravention of the Order. 2)The court imposed a fine of $10,000 on the owner. 3)The owner was to provide a copy of any written leases reviewed by the municipality and to provide an alternate lease to the landlord. 4)Random inspections of the entire structure and to be conducted weekly were not appropriate given the history of the matter. The Court considered random inspections of all parts of the property an excessive imposition."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT.

No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) were adversely affected if the order was granted. HELD: The application for the vesting ordered applied for was granted and the form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions was issue.  1)The jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new Land Titling Facilitation Regulations (LTR); the Land Tractor Facilitation Facilitation Act, 2000 combined with the Land Title Facilitation Regulations (LTCs) was reintroduced by the Land Tax Facilitation regulations (LTS) in 2003. 2)The applicant raised with counsel for the applicant the court's jurisdiction to issue the vestencing order in these circumstances. Neither HSBC nor the applicant schooled themselves in the proper procedure. Neither the bank nor the trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. Counsel requested the opportunity to address the concerns raised and to make supplementary submission in support of its application. 3)The application for a conditional vesting of order was denied.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The appellant filed a complaint under Part II of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code alleging that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. CUPE brought a claim against the appellant for breach of contract and breach of employment agreement. The appellant argued that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the city was responsible for the discrimination, as the appellant had not been properly accommodated in the workplace due to his disability and had improperly imparted a burden akin to a vicarious liability or a fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of the appellant's truck or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances. The tribunal also found that the appellant received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees because of the wage differential, which was an appropriate reason for the appellant to seek permanent employment. The applicant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant was not only disadvantaged in his employment, but in his ability to perform the jobs required due to the appellant’s disability. He was also disadvantaged in the manner in which he was employed. The discrimination was systemic and it was done to disadvantage the appellant because he was a casual employee. The City was not able to accommodate the appellant due to its disability. The fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy and was unable to perform his job as a casual did not excuse him. He had the potential to become an employee of the City. He would have been able to access employment insurance sooner if it was available. The appeal was also dismissed. 2) The tribunal was unable, in its own way, to accommodate a discrimination complaint made against the applicant because of his disabilities. The decision of the tribunal was not reasonably based on the appellant as a person of the age of 16 years. The court was unable and unwilling to make the application on the ground that the disability was a factor in his decision to seek employment with the City of Regina. The only reasonable conclusion was that the trial judge was correct in finding the City was in breach of the Code. The trial judge erred when he concluded that the decision of CUPe was reasonably accurate and was therefore correct in his inference that the discrimination was a result of the applicant’d disability. 3) The fact of the disability is a significant factor in the appellant making his application on a disability basis. The respondent’ s disability does not affect his ability or ability to work in the City, and the fact that he was given the option of either driving"

e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

The Court was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's testimony supported the Crown's charge.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] The majority of the claim by the respondent in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges it is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother says that the portions claimed as farm expenses are 10 percent and are not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. The father expensed electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses of $4,675, some of which should be added back to income. In 2003, the total amount claimed in the partnership was $15,000. The Court found that in 2004, the respondent was in a small credit position which he could offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. The last three categories involve the mother's request to add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in his partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father’s personal farming statement. The income of the petitioner is $24,300. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowance and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable. The principles in Rudachyk v. Rudachyck (1999), 180 Sask. R. 73 (C.A.), and Beeler v. Beelers (1997), both at Melfort, are applicable. HELD: The Court held that the trial was the fairest method of coming to the conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance. The issues were determined to be the most representative and fairest way of determining the respondent’ s. 8 income for the purposes of calculating child maintenance.  1) The respondent was responsible for 56 percent of s. expenses which consist of the non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The payment of s expenses in the percentage indicated shall commence on October 1, 2005 and are payable forthwith. 2) The Court was not prepared to add any of the other’S expenses in any of them.

e_2007nssc260.txt,"The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract. Following a two-day summary judgment application, the court granted judgment for one of the three quarters, with damages to be determined. Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production. The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery.","The defendant applied for summary judgment in a claim for costs arising out of a failed supply agreement. The defendant refused to supply on the basis that the agreement contained four separate call options for the purchase and delivery of low Sulphur Coal in quarterly installments of up to 100,000 tonnes. The plaintiff sought summary judgment for the failure to supply in quarters 2, 3 and 4 of the 2004 Coal Supply Agreement. The court granted summary judgment but refused to grant it a reduction in costs. The affiant was an expert retained by the defendant to provide an opinion on the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal by NSPI. The expert advised the plaintiff that he was unable to carry out the analysis due to the insufficiency of materials. After discovery, the discovery hearing took place in New York City in order to reduce some of the inconvenience and costs of conducting it in Colorado, United States of America, where the witness resides. This was done at the suggestion of the defendant's counsel. The discovery hearing in New Yorker took place over a period of two days. The parties ultimately reached a compromise thereby avoiding the need for the hearing in chambers. The judge awarded costs for a one-day application and fixed the amount involved at $1000. Costs were awarded at the rate of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000.00 together with taxable disbursements for filing and the like."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","The appellant appealed a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary within the Meaning of s. 7(1)(f) and s.7(1.1) of the Guidelines. He referred only to the costs of Ashley's Tae Kwan Do and soccer and to Mitchell's soccer. 2) The appellant's liability was for 73% of all eligible s. expenses, which he received tax free. 3) The respondent argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the extracurricular activities, which were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 4) The Chamber judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses are extraordinary within s. seven(1(1) and the Guidelines, and he did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient.

The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiff and defendant entered a contract for the construction of a glass sunroom with the defendant. The plaintiff paid the defendant $2,200 as deposit. The defendant refused to supply the concrete pilings and the plaintiff paid $2.5 million in error. The contract was frustrated and the defendant counterclaimed the amount owing. The plaintiffs sued for the return of the deposit. They argued that the defendant breached the contract by failing to provide the necessary materials and that the plaintiff was in breach of the contract. The defendants counterclaimed against the plaintiff for misappropriation of funds and misappropriated profits. The court awarded the plaintiff $176.22 for the balance owed to the defendant and $2 million to the plaintiff. The Court found that a just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to frustration of the breach should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The damages were assessed against the defendant in the counterclaim."
e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) of s.C. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: Appeal allowed. Following the conviction the Court of Appeal is of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her objectives. The Court of appeal is of opinion the Court erred here in finding that the judge has erred."
e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a) as well as with operating vehicles while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor was it a result of a wilful, blatant disrespect by the employer. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused. The officer was subjectively believed that he had reasonable grounds pursuant to s254(3) ofthe Code to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. However, the officer subjectively thought that he could arrest the officer for impaired impaired driving, nor did he have the grounds to arrest for impaired drinking, thus the arrest was unlawful, the search was unlawful and the rights were violated. The Court held that there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the charter and that the admission of evidence would be beneficial to society. The issue was whether the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The admission was not necessary to terminate the investigation. The Certificate of Analysis was not admissible."
e_2012skqb498.txt,"The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence. This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","FIAT: The defendant applied for an order for an inquiry into statements that the plaintiff alleges were made by the defendant on June 1, 2009. The statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray, and alleged that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The defendant also applied pursuant to Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence by pleading: Such words as were spoken or written by the Defendant are true and the Defendant asserts that the alleged defamation was justified in law. HELD: The application was granted. Costs of the application were in the cause in Q.B. 1607 of 2009."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their four siblings. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend was not extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court granted provisional permission in August 2013 to the Lawlessness children to attend the school. The family applied to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process. HELD: The Court found that the Lawlers had failed to live up to their ten commitments as a parent and family. The CÉF has failed to provide an educational environment free from discrimination, harassment and discrimination. The Family has failed, and continues to fail, to provide a French first language school.  1) The Court rejected the Lawler's application for an interlocutory injunction as an attempt to undermine their ten year tradition of attending a French school. 2) The Family was not consulted with the Court about the application for a declaration that the CÉFS discriminated against the Lawrays because of their disability. The Act distinguishes between 'conseil scolaire fransaskois' and 'conceil ecole fransaska'. The parties consistently referred to the CéF as the 'CÉF'. The CéLeste is a conseil Scolaire created by s. 42.1 of The Education Act to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransascolas in Saskatchewan. The Education act distinguishes between a 'conselil scule fransaspois' (CSF) and 'counsel' (conseile ecole). The parties clearly stated that the CSF's ostensible concern about the Lawling family's failure to liveup to their commitments was not the real reason for its decision to not renew their provisional permission. The CSF has demonstrated that it has a duty to provide quality educational instruction in a French First Language School to its children. The principles and goals of the CCEF are met in accordance with their respective constitutions. The court awarded the Lawlings special damages for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the costs of preparing the materials for the materials and preparing the necessary support to the end of the school year for their continued education.

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. The claims claim that the plaintiffs were misled and misled by the defendants' misleading and deceptive advertising. The defendants claim that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim, because the facts are not disputed and the determination of a single legal issue will decide whether the plaintiffs have a tenable cause of action. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff's affidavit was examined and the dates and times of the certification hearing were determined. The court reviewed the expert evidence and found that: 1) the defendants acknowledge that they have put identical products on the market but labelled these identical products differently. 2) the facts were undisputed. The only reason to label and market identical products is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. 3) While there may be a genuine issue for trial, the Court was not comfortable with determining the defendants's summary judgment application prior to deciding the plaintiffs' application for certification."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the information put forward by the respondent was not sufficient to require an assessment. As the respondent had not followed the court's standard of fairness and accuracy, it was not in the court’s interest to extend the time for the assessment. The respondent’S request was not fair and there were no properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the applicant. The respondents’ affidavits did not establish the length of time between the appointment of the bills and the time at which the assessment was requested."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in that amount. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent had unilaterally transferred their son, ostensibly because he was not receiving sufficient attention at Argyle. The respondent subsequently applied for interim child and spousals support and an equal division of family property. The court found the respondent’ s Federal Child Tax Credit to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed interim spouse and child support of $5,250.00. The Court also found the appellant’S Federal Child Services Guidelines to be in excess in excesses of $250,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded interim child care and spouse support in addition to child support and child and child maintenance.  2) The Court reviewed the financial statements and personal tax returns and found the child to be doing well in the chosen field. The children’re educational needs were met primarily through the care of their son. D.K. was an intelligent and pleasant boy, who was generally well-behaved. He was active in the community and enjoyed spending time with his friends. He and the respondent, who had recently moved to Canada, had a son, who resided with them for the past four years. DK.’d been attending Grade 5 at the time of the birth and was doing well academically. He also had a grade 7 education. He worked part-time and was able to assist with the child’ss education and health care needs. The child was attending classes at a private school and was involved in the daily activities of the child. The father was working part- time and was responsible for the child care needs of the school and the child and the mother. The mother was also involved in her son’situation. The parties had a child and a young child. D’K. had a varied educational background. He had recently transferred from a private university to a university. He earned a C in the sciences and had a doctorate in education. DQ. was attending a public school. He lived with the mother for the first three weekends of each month and for the last two months of that month. He shared night call responsibilities three to four times per month and stayed home with the son. He did not attend any parties. The family relocated to Saskatoon in the fall of 2012."
