The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard.

The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error.

The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given that the presumption of care and control was rebutted, the trial judge next considered whether the accused had 'de facto control' as defined by Boudreault (2012 SKPC 129), [2012] SCR 157, and found that he did. 2) The trial judge found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the appellant did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as rebutting the statutory presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings.","He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code. The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilyzer readings simply could have not been obtained by the consumption of one or two beer while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. [16] In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge’s reasons disclose that he applied the wrong legal test as to de facto care and control. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests. As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed. Accordingly, the appellant was not prejudiced by the trial judge’s error of law. [30] That said, it is my view that the trial judge’s reasons do not disclose an error within the meaning of the third part of the test outlined in Morrissey.  That is, they do not disclose that the trial judge failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue which played an essential part in the reasoning process which resulted in the conviction. This unrepresented accused was given a very strong message by the learned trial judge that there was no point in leading evidence in an attempt to challenge the accuracy of the Intoxylizer results. Further, and although the learned trial judge initially referred to the fact that the appellant could prove either equipment malfunction or operator error, his comments, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the only expert evidence that would have been relevant would be evidence relating to equipment malfunction. [51] In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to hold the appellant responsible for the failure to press the issue of operator error, or to refuse relief because he did not do so. [52] In the result, it is my respectful opinion that the trial judge’s comments compromised trial fairness, thereby resulting in an error of law within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is accordingly granted on this ground. [56] However, this is not a case where the alleged Charter breach was first raised on appeal. In the result, the appeal should be allowed on this ground as well. [73] In this case, it is my view that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested or aggravated if the appellant is tried a fourth time. [76] To the extent that there is any doubt remaining, it is also my view that the balancing of interests called for by the third test confirms that this is one of those “clearest of cases” which call for a stay of proceedings. [77] The appeal is allowed, and it is hereby ordered that the proceedings against the appellant are stayed. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests.

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.

He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case.

The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section.

[3] The Federation and the Students’ Union now seek to overturn that order. [4] I conclude, for the reasons set out below, that the appeals must be dismissed. [21] It is not necessary to work through the merits of these arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, I am entirely satisfied that Mr. Mowat is a “proper person” to bring the application as per s. 222(d) of the Act . Mr. Mowat was very actively involved in the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. The fact that his application was ultimately argued a few months after he had convocated should not, in my view, defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. I see no justice in denying Mr. Mowat’s standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by Mr. Mowat and others about the referendum.

The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order.

HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused.

The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the breathalyzer readings and the accused offered an innocent explanation for them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the trial judge found that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The accused's driving pattern may well have been combination of alcohol and a very hurting ankle but certainly some of the driving was result of his impairment. The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit.' The judge accepted that the accused's unsteadyiness could have been function of the hurt ankle.

2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The court found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The trial judge did not refer to the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused and did not address the respondent's belief that he was being threatened; and the proportionality of his response. The appellant's mistake of fact was reasonable and he did not focus on the fact there were two officers present. It is not unreasonable for the appellant to believe that he is in imminent danger of death or grievous bodily harm and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable.

The trial court found that even if the accused’s mistake of fact had been reasonable, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. 2) The Court found that the trial judge was not in error in that he did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence, and instead focused on the fact there were two officers present. The Appeal judge reviewed the evidence and found that most of the incidents were within the range of what the Crown could reasonably conclude was an attack reasonably apprehended in circumstances where the officer was armed with pepper spray and there was another officer present.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination.

CUPE had no claim to the right to be recalled into the position of permanent employee based on seniority. 2) The tribunal failed to take into account the applicant's disability. The fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy made his complaint within the Code's limitation period irrelevant. It was impossible for the applicant to gain employment with the City because of the entry-level position. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the Applicant. The tribunal was negligent in failing to find the City accommodated the Applicant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship. The Applicant's numerous attempts to gain permanent status were unsuccessful.

The respondent claimed that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The tribunal found that the respondent had made his complaint within the Code's limitation period and that, because of this disability, he was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The tribunal failed to take into account the respondent's disability or the fact that he was a casual employee in the City. It was impossible for the respondent to gain employment with the City because the entry-level position was something he could not do because of his disabilities. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the petitioner because of the entry level position and he received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees. The wage differential was inappropriate and the respondent was compensated in the amount of $8,902.00. 2)The respondent's numerous attempts to gain permanent status over the years were unsuccessful. His frustration with the city and CUPE heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after him, who passed the respondent on the seniority list and then assigned him as permanent employee to drive tandem truck. The decision was based on an informal arrangement whereby casual employees were given priority over permanent employees in bidding for any permanent position, amongst those who were qualified. The City was able to accommodate the respondent by allowing him to move between truck driving duties. The appellant's casual employment hours always entitled him to collect Employment Insurance in the winter.","[1] This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the “City”) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (“CUPE”) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J.

His frustration with the city and with the court heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after the applicant, passing him on the seniority list. The applicant's casual employment hours always entitled him to collect Employment Insurance in the winter.",0.3556443556443556,e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."

Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. The Crown suggests that the Charter breach does not reach the threshold of exclusion, pointing out that the police officers did not act in bad faith.

The court granted the defendants leave nunc pro tunc in the cause.","[1] This is an application by the City of Saskatoon and William Hewitt (the ""third parties"") to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action. FACTS [2] Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology and Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (the ""plaintiffs"") allege that the action of the defendant, Hagblom Constructions (1984) Ltd. (""Hagblom"") caused a fire in the plaintiffs building occurring January 5, 1997. [3] The essence of the defendant\'s allegations in the third party claim may be characterized as follows:

(a) In paragraphs 8 to 12 of the third party claim, the defendants allege that the actions or omissions of the City of Saskatoon\'s fire department either caused the plaintiffs\' loss, or contributed to it. ISSUES (1) Do the provisions of s. 136.1(2) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984, S.S. 1983-1984, c. U-11, and s. 34 of The Fire Prevention Act, 1992, S.S. 1992, c. F-15.001 prevent the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties in this case and, if so, should the entire third party claim be struck out pursuant to Queen\'s Bench Rule 173(a)? (2) Should paragraphs 13, 14 and 16 be struck out, pursuant to Queen\'s Bench Rule 173(a), on the basis that these paragraphs do not disclose a reasonable cause of action in that the common law does not recognize a cause of action for the spoliage or destruction of evidence, nor for the failure to assist in the gathering of evidence, and, further, on the basis that the Third Parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants in this respect? [22] I agree with Hrabinsky J. Here in the third party claim it is alleged that the fire department of the City of Saskatoon was negligent in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. On that basis alone I am satisfied that the defendants have an arguable case and that the third party claim discloses a reasonable cause of action. the application is dismissed. [27] As to s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act, I hereby grant the defendants leave nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings against the third parties.",0.4781849912739964,0.5750000000000001,"This was an application by the City of Saskatoon and the third parties to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The claim was advanced in contract and in tort. HELD: The third parties' application was dismissed. 1)Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for notice of motion and for leave to bring third party proceedings. The only documents to be considered on an application under Rule 173(a) are the Notice of Motion, the statement of claim itself and the particulars furnished pursuant to demand. The defendants claim the fire department failed to properly fight the fire, and that they omitted certain actions prior to the fire that supposedly contributed to its spread.  2)The third parties submitted that Hrabinsky was in error when he held that s.34 did not nullify an action for omitting what was to be done in good faith.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence. (2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.

HELD: The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the person's ability to operate motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drugs.  1)It was assumed that the white vehicle was not speeding but it was coming into collision with oncoming traffic travelling in the proper lane and thus causing an accident. 2)The blood alcohol reading taken from the victim was accurately recorded as 216 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which was within the range of background interference for the test equipment.  3)Although the accused's condition may have affected her ability to drive, the initial reading of her blood alcohol level at 12:10 p.m. was accurate, as was the extrapolation of that reading back to the time of the operation of the motor vehicle in the same day.  4)The accused was found to have been inebriated. 5)The Court rejected the defence's submission that the hospital laboratory analysis was derived from blood serum rather than whole blood as there was no evidence at trial to prove the fact assumed.  6)The evidence did not support the admission of the expert's opinion as to the blood alcohol concentration in the victim's body.","And furthermore, AT THE SAME TIME AND PLACE AFORESAID, did have the care or control of a motor vehicle while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, and thereby caused bodily harm to Raelee KANE, contrary to s.255(2) of the Criminal Code.

There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default.

Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.

In addition, all of the invoices marked unpaid and claimed at trial continued to be sent to the address for Standard at 417 Maxwell Crescent in Regina and there was evidence that these accounts were forwarded to the defendant.  6)The defendant was",0.6208588957055214,3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number."

In 1990 he became co-director of postsecondary programs and remained in that position until terminated in 1997. In 1997 he was appointed co-president of the Board of Directors of the education complex. He now seeks damages for breach of contract and insubordination.  1) The plaintiff's employment agreement provided for an annual salary of $45,760 to be paid in twelve monthly installments. Up to the date of his termination he had received $33,366.38. He was entitled to judgment for the difference and pre-judgment interest on that amount calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act.  2) It was impossible for the plaintiff to adapt to the short-term funding environment created by the proposed method of proceeding with personnel issues within the education system. The fact that he was dismissed within weeks of his contract expiring in the normal course did not warrant summary dismissal. 3) Just cause is not altogether a term of art. In general, it refers to that degree of misconduct or incompetence which warrants stiff reprisal as opposed to some lesser sanction such as a warning, reprimand or remediation.

The father testified he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The mother's request to add back half of the respondent's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners was substantially different than that contained in his personal farming statement. It appears that the more appropriate amount would be $5,000. In 2003, the income of the petitioner was $24,300. In 2004, the respondent was in a smaller credit position, but he could offset against continuing maintenance but only to the extent of $50 so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the over payment has been extinguished.

There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is one of those files where it appeared that the holding of trial, in fact, was more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There was nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to conclude that the capital costs allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed, that any expenses or accounting functions used by partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. Therefore, the Court was unable to find that the respondent has overpaid child maintenance in 2003, 2004 and 2005. It would appear that the amount paid in 2003 and the healthy income to the farmer otherwise in that year, was means of splitting income and as such,",0.6244175209692452,e_2006skqb446.txt,"Division of the matrimonial property is at issue.

d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage.

For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; in dealing with maintenance under the Divorce Act; the wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so that she could retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of the net proceeds if it were to be sold in the future; the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconscionable and harsh to bind the wife to such a agreement. Both parties acknowledge that there are no factors that have been established under s 13 of the Act to warrant the creation of a division such as this; in fact there is no reference to independent legal advice in our statute. A divorce judgment is granted based on the finding that there was no possibility of a reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing. The wife's application for a share in the value of her Matrimonial Home (net equity) was dismissed. Husband and wife separation agreement set aside; maintenance to be increased in the amount of $1,000 per month; wife to pay monthly maintenance of $600; husband to pay child support of $800 per month until age 65; if the courts are not prepared to enforce the maintenance provisions of the contract they will make an order varying the terms of the agreement as the court sees fit.","Both parties acknowledge having been given the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice, without influence or involvement of the other, and by executing these presents confirm that this clause may constitute a full answer and complete defence to any claim of undue influence, coercion or lack of opportunity for independent advice. The asset division achieved by Mrs. Durocher under the separation agreement is far from being unconscionable, unduly harsh or fraudulent. It is an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor. I find as a fact that Mrs. Durocher selected the firm of Farwell & Hines and that she did receive separate independent legal advice.

Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti, in January 2007. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for variation of child support in September 2006. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The mother's poor treatment and disdain of the father and his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with him misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.  2) The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has been set at 1).","Disposition: Appeal Allowed [1] Lori Ann Olszewski (Willick) (the mother) in January 2007 applied to vary an order for maintenance dated January 9, 1992, for her daughters Nicole and Kirsti (the daughters). [2] This appeal is about: (i) whether Nicole and Kirsti, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father’s charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act[1] (the “Act”) and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education; and (ii) whether the maintenance the father paid in the past for them was sufficient and appropriate.

The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.

HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest.

His assets were $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. His statement of affairs showed that he had $50,000 in assets at the time of his assignment, but that amount was reduced to $8,000 as a result of the combined forces of drought and BSE. The bankrupt argued that he purchased cattle for $1,000 per head prior to bankruptcy but could only sell them at his expense. He alleged that he sold cattle post-bankruptcy to save his farm. SCU brought an application to compel the bankrupt to consent to judgment on s.173(1)(a) and sought payment of the cost award of $12,000 coupled with a conditional order of consent of half of their judgment.

The Court found that this ground had been met and that the bankrupt should be able to comply with it within three years which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with such a condition. There was no question that his assets were less than.50 cents on the dollar when he commenced farming in 2001 and they had increased over the years.

His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The bankruptcy judge adjourned the application sine die and fiat issued requiring further disclosure. The bankrupt asserted a security interest over the equity pursuant to s173(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He argued that the drought, which had occurred five or six years prior to his assignment, had resulted in his inability to grow sufficient feed for his cattle operation and he was forced to purchase cattle feed at great expense. He also claimed that he sold cattle in the year prior to bankruptcy because it simply amounted to a sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business. SCU cross-examined the bankrupt and found him to be evasive, uncooperative and un-attentive to his duties under the BIA and at times verbally abusive. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s172(2) and the appropriate terms of his discharge were set out. 1)The bankrupt was 42 years old. He had one son from a previous relationship who did not reside with him. He was employed with an excavating company earning $20/hr but could only buy cattle at night. His farm and personal accounts were in state of total disarray. He should be able to comply with the conditional order within three years, which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a conditional order. The court found that the bankrupt's pattern of breeding and raising cattle with view to selling the calves in the same year constituted the normal course of his farming operation and it made little sense to fault him for selling inventory in that course when it's part of the business operation itself and done for purposes of earning livelihood in a recognized, routine way. 2)In circumstances of significant asset depletion without corresponding satisfactory explanation, the bankrupt failed to meet the onus on him. His failure to produce proper records and to assist the trustee to the fullest was found to have been established. The onus is on the objecting creditor to prove the existence of s173 (2)of the Act if it is not otherwise reported by the trustee. The Court awarded costs of the trial at not less than $300 per month and an absolute order of discharge in the amount of $50,000 which represents half of the judgment.","[1] Robert Alan Burroughs (“Burroughs”) applies for his discharge from bankruptcy through his trustee.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary. He must have found one-half (i.e., five) of these extracurricular activities were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 2) The appellant appeals only this aspect of the fiat, arguing that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the costs associated with the children's activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses'. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73% of Ashley's Tae Kwon Do and soccer costs, Mitchell's soccer costs and Makayla's voice and soccer.

Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines.",0.4355828220858895,0.2360406091370558,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary. He must have found one-half (i.e., five) of these extracurricular activities were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 2) The appellant appeals only this aspect of the fiat, arguing that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the costs associated with the children's activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses'. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73% of Ashley's Tae Kwon Do and soccer costs, Mitchell's soccer costs and Makayla's voice and soccer. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband.

There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v.

Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were to be in joint custody of the children. Their access to the matrimonial home was largely divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. Their desire to eventually relocate to Alberta to marry a speech language pathologist had resulted in the children residing an equal amount of time in each parent's home. Although there was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody, the children's educational needs would be met in their new home. It was in their best interests that they be in their father's home and that they receive the most structure and support in their educational endeavours.","[2] The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. [37] In making an order for custody pursuant to the Divorce Act, I must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. [40] For the foregoing reasons, I find it in the children‘s best interests that they be in the joint custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.] and that they reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.

Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, who were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The motor vehicle accident occurred in October 1998 and both Johansson and Johansson were paid their damages as result of the releases given to Citadel. Both the parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs. HELD: Both conditions were satisfied and the defendant was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process. There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by the Johansson sisters. The defendant GMCL cannot rely on the defendants, who are the subject of this motion only.

[2] Steven and Jody Johansson were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. [4] On September 13, 2004 a Statement of Claim was filed on behalf of all three plaintiffs alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 25, 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being driven by Maria Johansson. The plaintiffs now claim damages for the injuries they sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved. In short there was no privity of contract and since the alleged manufacturing defect was not known at the time the releases were signed there could be no intention to include GMCL. They should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim could result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. Conclusion [20] As between the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, and the defendant, GMCL, there are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial.

They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous.

Rule 14.25 offers a remedy whereby, if an appeal from that decision is allowed, the court will retain jurisdiction to decide whether the claim should be struck summarily.",0.4228571428571428,2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). Appeal dismissed. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it."

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan","[266] In the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary, the petitioner and the respondent are presumed to be joint custodians of their son, D.K. No such agreement exists in this case, and my interim order of August 7, 2014, while providing for interim parenting, did nothing to displace that presumption. [300] The evidence confirms that D.K. is a smart, sometimes sensitive but generally happy child. [304] In assessing the veracity of her claims, I note the respondent acknowledged, under cross-examination, that she had also previously accused the petitioner of threatening her and of sexually assaulting D.K., although she never made a formal complaint. [309] While I accept that the respondent has been D.K.’s primary and psychological parent throughout his life, I am equally satisfied on the evidence that she is generally contemptuous of the petitioner’s role as a parent and she has, except when it has suited her needs, restricted or in some instances, completely denied D.K.’s right to enjoy reasonable access with the petitioner. [310] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that D.K.’s interests will be best served by a parenting regime that preserves the stability the respondent has traditionally provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time he enjoys with the petitioner. [343] Finally, there is considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would work an undue hardship upon the petitioner. Pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he will be obliged to assume significant family debt, to provide the respondent with a considerable equalization payment in respect of her interest in the family home, and to pay increased child and spousal support. [344] Applying the D.B.S. factors holistically to the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate instance in which to make a retroactive order, save and except for the two months period in which the petitioner admittedly refused or neglected to pay child support in accordance with the interim order of this Court. As such, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent, on account of retroactive child support, the sum of $3,898.00. As there was no evidence that these proceeds, or any portion thereof continued to exist or are otherwise traceable as of the date of application, they do not meet the definition of family property. The respondent is entitled to an equalization payment from the petitioner in the amount of $36,850.00, representing one half of the parties’ total equity therein of $73,700.00. [373] On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent has established she is entitled to support on both a compensatory and non-compensatory basis. However, the unusually high amount of debt assumed by the petitioner, coupled with his limited means of satisfying such an award warrant a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the SSAG. [393] There is at present in this case, a genuine and material uncertainty as to the respondent’s future need and the extent to which she will achieve some degree of self-sufficiency. In the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate to make an indefinite award, which will be reviewable on the earlier of December 1, 2018, or the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine. In all the circumstances, I decline to make any order with regard to retroactive spousal support. CONCLUSION [399] The parties shall continue to enjoy joint custody of their son D.K., born --------------------. The petitioner’s obligations in respect of retroactive child support are fixed at $3,898.00.

The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan","[266] In the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary, the petitioner and the respondent are presumed to be joint custodians of their son, D.K. No such agreement exists in this case, and my interim order of August 7, 2014, while providing for interim parenting, did nothing to displace that presumption. [300] The evidence confirms that D.K. is a smart, sometimes sensitive but generally happy child. [304] In assessing the veracity of her claims, I note the respondent acknowledged, under cross-examination, that she had also previously accused the petitioner of threatening her and of sexually assaulting D.K., although she never made a formal complaint. [309] While I accept that the respondent has been D.K.’s primary and psychological parent throughout his life, I am equally satisfied on the evidence that she is generally contemptuous of the petitioner’s role as a parent and she has, except when it has suited her needs, restricted or in some instances, completely denied D.K.’s right to enjoy reasonable access with the petitioner. [310] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that D.K.’s interests will be best served by a parenting regime that preserves the stability the respondent has traditionally provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time he enjoys with the petitioner. [343] Finally, there is considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would work an undue hardship upon the petitioner. Pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he will be obliged to assume significant family debt, to provide the respondent with a considerable equalization payment in respect of her interest in the family home, and to pay increased child and spousal support. [344] Applying the D.B.S. factors holistically to the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate instance in which to make a retroactive order, save and except for the two months period in which the petitioner admittedly refused or neglected to pay child support in accordance with the interim order of this Court. As such, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent, on account of retroactive child support, the sum of $3,898.00. As there was no evidence that these proceeds, or any portion thereof continued to exist or are otherwise traceable as of the date of application, they do not meet the definition of family property. The respondent is entitled to an equalization payment from the petitioner in the amount of $36,850.00, representing one half of the parties’ total equity therein of $73,700.00. [373] On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent has established she is entitled to support on both a compensatory and non-compensatory basis. However, the unusually high amount of debt assumed by the petitioner, coupled with his limited means of satisfying such an award warrant a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the SSAG. [393] There is at present in this case, a genuine and material uncertainty as to the respondent’s future need and the extent to which she will achieve some degree of self-sufficiency. In the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate to make an indefinite award, which will be reviewable on the earlier of December 1, 2018, or the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine. In all the circumstances, I decline to make any order with regard to retroactive spousal support. CONCLUSION [399] The parties shall continue to enjoy joint custody of their son D.K., born --------------------. The petitioner’s obligations in respect of retroactive child support are fixed at $3,898.00. [414] Commencing December 1, 2015 and on the first day of each and every month thereafter, the petitioner shall pay support for the respondent in the amount of $6,000.00, provided however that the said order shall be reviewable at the instance of either party upon the earlier of the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine in Canada, or the 1st day of December 2018. Within 14 days thereafter, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent the sum of $36,850.00, representing her interest in the equity therein.",0.4475524475524475,0.4486692015209125,"HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province.

The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."

The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.

The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonet and therefore was obliged to pay rent.

Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) and (16).Gari's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPPA. HELD: The appeal was allowed. It was common ground that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal evidence that the building had been sold to a third party in the spring and was not removed from the property until the fall resulted in a determination that the Building was not properly removed. The plaintiff had not established its claim for damages until it had paid rent and received a security deposit. The court found that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to removal the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail.  1) The trial court reviewed the relevant statutes and found that s.36 of the Act does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. 2) The analysis of the positions of the parties must proceed on that same basis, i.e. on the same basis that, as of September 1, 2017, the building was removed, the site returned to its original state and the $3,500 security deposit returned to Gari. Gari paid a total of $6,227.88 in property taxes during the time period when it says the Building remained on the Property after it should have been removed. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town. 3) The Court reviewed the circumstances and found there was no evidence that Lakeland intended to seize the building unless it paid a specified amount for disposal.

HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs to the credit union in the amount of $6,227.88 plus costs. 1)The trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The material suggests the Applicant had no use for the building and wished it removed from the outset. The building was sold to a third party in the spring of 2001. However, it was not removed. The defendant took possession of the Building and rented it out for storage. These actions reflect the terms of its lease with Lakeland. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture in the Property, it is not being removed. 2)It is common ground that the defendant in this case will seek damages for unjust enrichment in the same amount as the damages determined in connection with the theft of the building. If that issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by the plaintiff against the credit Union.

At the end of December 2000, it applied for an order that removal of the Building be postponed until the Credit Union paid (a) $3,500 as security for reimbursement for possible removal damage; (b) rent of $500 per month from April 1999 through to the date the Building was removed, and (c) $2,818.04 of municipal property taxes for the period April 1999 to December 31, 2000. With respect to the Applicant’s claim for occupation rent and reimbursement of taxes paid over the past year, this portion of the application is dismissed. In my view the evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the plaintiff actually recovered. [32] That said, I agree with the Credit Union that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to remove the Building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. [40] In light of the foregoing, I conclude that the Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of Gari for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail. As a consequence, I am of the opinion that no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. The appeal is allowed. Further, as indicated, Gari’s cross-appeal is dismissed.",0.6159600997506235,0.6834285714285714,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonet and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) and (16).Gari's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPPA. HELD: The appeal was allowed. It was common ground that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal evidence that the building had been sold to a third party in the spring and was not removed from the property until the fall resulted in a determination that the Building was not properly removed. The plaintiff had not established its claim for damages until it had paid rent and received a security deposit. The court found that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to removal the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. As a result of that delay, it was necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari against the CreditU. 1) The Court of Appeal did not find any principled basis on which person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. That stance would be inconsistent with that regime established in s. 72. The credit union will proceed on that basis but will not wish to be taken as having resolved that point either way. 2) There is a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interests such as Gari. S. 36 creates a special rule in relation to the conduct of the financer of the goods as it generally gives priority to a real property owner over financer. This principle is reflected in the fact that the",0.6834285714285714,7_2005skca97.txt,"The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest.

HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails."

[66] Thus, I conclude that the trial judge erred by (i) misapplying the test in Chaplin, (ii) imposing a burden on the defence, and (iii) concluding that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations by providing the Index.

In the weeks immediately before the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day to allow proper review of the documents. During that time, defence counsel also requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. HELD: The application to adjourn the trial was granted. The Court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to a miscarriage of justice as the accused could not demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. As the accused had disclosed the documents to defence counsel, the Court was in the same position as the trial judge and could not assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available.",0.5542168674698795,d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure."

The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg.

General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt).

2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife had been left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to the judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.00. The husband was given one-half of the matrimonial home valued at $8,358.00 and an accrual to a Standard Life policy during the same period of $2,200 for $890.00 plus an additional $4,445.00 for the home. The father was to claim an exemption for his own house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' property. Such a division would mean that the father was being given one half of the only asset the wife had during the marriage and he was to have to assume a large mortgage or move out of his modest $60,000 home or to a rental accommodation. Both parties had the benefit of the home during their marriage. The wife had no savings, no pension and had little financial problems.

Edward has assumed debts of almost $5,000.00 of which $2,500.00 must be credited to him, leaving a credit to Sharon of $1,945.00. I have also accepted the claim that Edward’s house, jointly owned with his mother as protection “in case he meets someone” is exempt property.

In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to the judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.00. The husband was given one-half of the matrimonial home valued at $8,358.00 and an accrual to a Standard Life policy during the same period of $2,200 for $890.00 plus an additional $4,445.00 for the home. The father was to claim an exemption for his own house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' property. Such a division would mean that the father was being given one half of the only asset the wife had during the marriage and he was to have to assume a large mortgage or move out of his modest $60,000 home or to a rental accommodation. Both parties had the benefit of the home during their marriage. The wife had no savings, no pension and had little financial problems. She was to be awarded the $25,000 or so that she claimed against the home under the Act. Although the wife's claim was inequitable and had she not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs.",0.530214424951267,2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property."

He was dismissed from his employment without notice in 1988 for his 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a fifteen minute break for breakfast and an unpaid supper break for lunch. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to comply with company policy regarding breaks and overtime. Awarding the plaintiff $15.00 for an hour of work over an eight hour period, that day's break was $5.00 less an hour than normal and included breaks of 15 and 40 minutes.

It was apparent from the evidence that the drivers and helpers had broken the rules by making the commutes to and from the warehouse, even though they were not paid at the time they were working. The fact that the breaks were often longer than they should have been and the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. On the evidence, the plaintiff testified that he stopped in at the Seabreeze Inn on most Thursdays when he did the Hubbards run and claimed overtime for the time he spent there. At his corrective interview in September, 1988, the driver and his helper were each given a 15 minute break in the morning and forty-five minute break during the afternoon. They claimed that they were entitled to breaks for lunch and that they had been given extra breaks for their breaks on the nights they were in the warehouse. As the plaintiff had not followed the company's rules, he was dismissed without notice. He claimed that his break was excessive and that he should have taken more breaks during the day. He also claimed that extra breaks were not included in his calculation for lunch break time. The only reasonable explanation given by the plaintiff was that he had been told by his supervisors that these breaks were part of his job.

b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The plaintiff took four years post-graduate course in Illinois and received a Master of Science in 1984. In 1984, he started work at the University of Saskatchewan as an assistant professor. He received his full professorship in 1991. He was appointed director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in 2002. During the long weekend, the part of the hospital was closed to the public. During and after the renovation to the building, the plaintiff kept a log of his work log from May 2005 to January 2006. It appears that the notice was posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and by posting on the CUPE website. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. The privilege extends to all communications made by high executive officers acting in the performance of their official duties relating to matters of state, such as the creation of a grievance procedure or an arbitration procedure. Counsel for the plaintiff is awarded costs. 1) The Court accepts the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 2) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. The words of the grievance were found to be highly impugned in the sense that they would tend to lower the plaintiff’s reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person and to the words in fact referred to the plaintiff. It is not necessary for the tribunal to have all the powers of an ordinary Court. The tort is one of strict liability. Jurisdiction is one in which strict liability prevails. The court found that the plaintiff had not only refused to prevent the harassment but had been an active participant and contributor to the harassment himself. 3) The plaintiff was found to have been defamed by the wording of the respondent in his grievance. The respondent was found not to have acted in a negligent or intentional manner in failing to prevent or to seek the assistance of the defendants in this matter. The claim was dismissed with costs. 4) The court accepted the defendants’ defence in qualified privilege on the basis that the respondent had not established jurisdiction as required by s. 16 of the Trade Union Act. The Court found that jurisdiction is not the only determinative factor in determining whether a claim has been made pursuant to s. 21 of the Act. It was also found in the Court of Appeal that jurisdiction does not lie with the respondent.","OVERVIEW [1] The plaintiff says that his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made intentionally and maliciously by the defendants.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was driving a motor vehicle that was operating in the manner dangerous to the public. The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive a vehicle.

Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan did operate a
motor vehicle on the streets of the City of Regina to

the public, and did hereby cause the death of Vernon
Keith Ward contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal
Code of Canada. Specifically the defence argues that a sentence in the lower
end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such
a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in
the community, rather than in a corrections facility. I am concerned in this matter with the principles of
general deterrence, denunciation, protection of the public,
and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of
justice. I must also be concerned with the principles of
specific deterrence and rehabilitation of the accused. A troubling factor in this instance arises from the
subsequent convictions of the accused for two speeding
offences. Therefore, in respect to the offence of dangerous
driving causing death, I sentence the accused to be imprisoned
for 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre at Regina,
Saskatchewan, said sentence to be served intermittently. In addition, I direct that the accused enter into a
probation order which shall commence after he has served his
sentence of imprisonment for 90 days and which shall be for a

The entitlement to sue for the disgorgement of profits hinges on whether Wolff, as its former employee, was in a position of fiduciary. The documents seized under the Anton Piller order had provided full disclosure to the plaintiff, and the plaintiffs would not seek any further order to restrain the defendants from competing with them. There was no evidence of breach of contract or improper interference by the defendants. The plaintiff's application to strike these portions of the claim was dismissed.  1)The defendants had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This joint venture required confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain their confidentiality. 2)The plaintiff was not disadvantaged in her claim by allowing the defendants to withhold their work product at this stage because the plaintiffs already had an immediate remedy should the defendants poach their clients. It follows that the plaintiffs can easily discern if the defendants are breaching that order. No breach has been alleged.",0.5591939546599496,9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract."

There is a need and ability to pay.  3) The Court reviewed the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties.",0.4872231686541737,7_2013skqb67.txt,"The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference."

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and Tenant and the operator of the Oshawa Group contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents? 2) Was the loss covered by insurance and whether insurance should have covered the damage; 3) Did estoppel apply? The arbitrator was not limited to the interpretation of the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage and whether the amount of damages. The disputes were with respect to two sets of clauses: repair and loss of rental opportunity. The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions. The decision to award damages was patently unreasonable. Both parties agreed that the standard of review was correctness and that it should be extended to the determination of the facts and to the effect of the legislation statutory tribunal is empowered to administer. The issue on appeal was whether this expanded scope of judicial review should apply to the awards of consensual arbitrators. HELD: The award would withstand judicial review.  1) It was the conduct of the parties that caused the error. They did not have jurisdiction to deal with it outside of their jurisdiction. The conduct of their employees and the manner in which they communicated to the other parties was beyond their jurisdiction to interfere with the award. 2) The arbitrators were not limited simply to interpreting the words in the lease and to giving the clauses an interpretation the language will reasonably bear. They were there in the commercial context and they were done expeditiously. 3) There was no breach of the tenants' rights by virtue of the use of the term arbitration. 4) In exercising their jurisdiction, an arbitrator must comply with the recognized tenets of procedural fairness. 5) The Court should only intervene if they find a genuine excess of jurisdiction by the arbitration clause, not simply where they disagree with his findings. The Court must look carefully at the decision. The decisions of arbitrators are often subject to judicial review outside the jurisdiction of the Court. In this case the Court was not satisfied that the standards of curial deference, and judicial restraint, applied to the decisions of a consensual arbitrator, but rather that they were broadly applicable and the Court could not ignore the fact that the agreement","The Tenant seeks to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed.

Had it been a case, in the face of a strong privative clause, that it was immune from judicial review, even if patently unreasonable? 3) If so, what was the extent of the damages? Estoppel should not be limited to the wording of the clauses of the lease. Where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. Here the courts in both directions agree that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal more broadly with the clauses and their contents. The disputes were the result of acts or errors of the tenants and the landlords. There was no evidence that the tenants were contributing to the damage or that the damages were due to the actions of the landlords or the tenants themselves.

He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established.

The impact on the accused was also at the lower end of the spectrum.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them. The grounds relied on by the appellant were not patently unreasonable because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at the same. 2)The employer did not engage in these further inquiries and efforts by the employer.

6. The performance of a contract that

agreement into something other than that
intended. . . I do not believe there was sufficient
evidence to show that the Respondent

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The stated grounds of appeal were that the conviction was against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence; that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight; and that, given the evidence, it was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, Sparrow, which was used in R. v. Grumbo and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The conclusion that night hunting with artificial lights, so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right was justifiable. The appellants had failed to show any error in law by applying the Sparrow test. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not necessary to set aside the decision on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The issue on this appeal was whether the regulations were a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and, if so, whether they were justifiable pursuant to Sparrow. 1)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights; the Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. 2)The trial judge did go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification. That is where the safety purpose of the legislation ought to be considered. 3)The evidence did not show that the accused Indians were Indians under s. 3 of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) but that they had moved to Meadow Lake and now only embark upon traditional Metis way of life during the summer months or other times when their children are not in school. 4)It was not proven that the people of Sapwagamik, who took the scrip in 1906, preferred as a community to hunt in the dark. The Aboriginal group was consulted. 5)It could not be said that the appellantants, like everyone else, were subject to the Saskatchewan regulation that prohibits night hunting by means of an artificial light.

The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants’ right to hunt for food and, if so, whether it is justifiable. Further, the trial judge concluded that the legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right. [18] The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples’ right:
1. Does the legislation have avalid objective?

2. Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples?

3. Has there been as little infringement as possible?

4. Has the Aboriginal group been consulted? But aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. CONCLUSION [27] It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.

The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis (Indians) within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate aboriginal peoples' right (s.11.1) and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights. The appellants have failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test pursuant to Sparrow.  2)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights protected by s.7 and s.8 of the Constitution Act, 1867, were clearly subject to federal and provincial legislation if the legislation does not constitute prima facie infringement of those rights. 3)The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. There was no infringement of aboriginal rights arising from the legislation. The question was whether the legislation had an avalid objective? Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples? Has there been as little infringement as possible? 4)Had the Aboriginal group been consulted? The answer was yes. The trial judge applied the Sparrow test of infringement and justification to the issue. The issue was whether s.11.(3) infringed the accused's aboriginal right and if so, whether it was justifiable.  5)The court was unable to accept that the appellant's argument that night hunting with artificial lights was not part of any aboriginal hunting right, and even if it was, it was justified because of the strong safety factor. 6)The appellants were not subject to the restrictions imposed by the Regulations. They enjoyed aboriginal hunting rights independent of s.35(1). The regulations did not affect their Aboriginal right.  7)The appeal was also dismissed on the ground of an error in assessment of the facts.","[1] This is an appeal by Mervin Maurice and Walter Gardiner from their summary conviction on October 5, 2001, for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants’ right to hunt for food and, if so, whether it is justifiable. Further, the trial judge concluded that the legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right.

2. Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples?

3. Has there been as little infringement as possible?

4. Has the Aboriginal group been consulted? But aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. CONCLUSION [27] It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is dismissed.",0.5803432137285492,0.5505716798592788,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, the Sparrow test, and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The trial judge did not go on to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. 2)The evidence did not show that the impugned regulation imposed an undue hardship on the Metis in general, or that they preferred as a community to hunt in the night with artificial lights. 3)Safety was not the primary purpose of the regulation. The Court was unable to accept that because the appellant were Metis under the Constitution, their rights were not subject to the regulation to the extent that it affected their Aboriginal rights. The Aboriginal group was consulted. 4)The issue on this appeal was whether the appellant's Metis hunting and fishing rights, which are protected by s. 35(1) of The Constitution Act and the right to bear a mose and deer for food that had not been extinguished prior to 1982, were infringed by the regulations.

The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director and it appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals. HELD: The damages are set at $862.50. The plaintiff's claim for general damages is dismissed. 1) The Court rejected the landlord's denial of liability. The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and that her discounting of the value of the furniture, $50 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing went a little too far. It was impossible to believe that the landlord, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed the plaintiff as credible, the Court could not believe that she would have engaged in such a tactics. 2) The damages were set a revised amount of $1,000,000. There was no credible evidence that the plaintiff's original belongings were ruined. The general damages estimate was based on four years of age, which could not be reconciled with the evidence of four or five years old. Jurisdiction was divided between two versions of the facts. The first version was more challenging, had the bylaw inspector's findings been independently confirmed. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The second version was impossible because he could not have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. The landlord testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. The tenant spoke at length about what she regarded as the poor condition of the premises left by the tenant, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She wondered aloud why if there was mould that it only affected the tenant's furniture and area rug, and was not obvious on the other carpeting. This is a legitimate question which, while relevant, is not really answerable at this time. The two versions were as far apart as they could be. The applicant's task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging had I not been able and inclined to rely on the Bylaw Inspector's findings.

The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence.

The plaintiff's claim for general damages is dismissed. 1) The evidence of the original four year old who suffered from mouldy conditions was advanced. Her discounting of the value of the furniture and clothing went a little too far. Because the matter is before the Court on a de novo basis, damages are assessed a little higher. The Court would allow $712.50 for the furniture, $50.00 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing for a total of $861.50 damages. 2) The Court rejected the landlord's claim of responsibility for the original $11,500 cost of the furnishings and clothing. There was no credible allegation of liability advanced by the plaintiff. 3) The damages were set a revised amount of $1,000,000.00. Amounts were reduced as a result of the Court finding that the director erred in her estimate of general damages, which was entirely too high.","[1] This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007.

The plaintiff's claim for general damages is dismissed. 1) The Court rejected the landlord's denial of liability. The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and that her discounting of the value of the furniture, $50 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing went a little too far. It was impossible to believe that the landlord, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed the plaintiff as credible, the Court could not believe that she would have engaged in such a tactics. 2) The damages were set a revised amount of $1,000,000. There was no credible evidence that the plaintiff's original belongings were ruined. The general damages estimate was based on four years of age, which could not be reconciled with the evidence of four or five years old. Jurisdiction was divided between two versions of the facts. The first version was more challenging, had the bylaw inspector's findings been independently confirmed. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The second version was impossible because he could not have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. The landlord testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. The tenant spoke at length about what she regarded as the poor condition of the premises left by the tenant, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She wondered aloud why if there was mould that it only affected the tenant's furniture and area rug, and was not obvious on the other carpeting. This is a legitimate question which, while relevant, is not really answerable at this time. The two versions were as far apart as they could be. The applicant's task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging had I not been able and inclined to rely on the Bylaw Inspector's findings.

d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court.

While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS.

HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The children were to reside with the mother H.H. and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems. 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. 2) The father was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both the mother and the father were in care for most of their lives. The permanency committee had explored resources with the Indian Band, A.A. and Narcotics Anonymous once per week. The parents had weekly two hour supervised visits with the social service worker. The evidence showed that the mother was often late for parenting classes, sometimes late for one or both parenting sessions and sometimes late at night. The father indicated that he was not looking forward to going to bed at night because he was afraid of the attention of the Ministry staff. 3) The evidence did not support the father's position on the Harm Reduction Methadone Program notes but the father proposed that he would continue living with the Mother while she first attended anger management class and took anger management courses and he would first attend a parenting class and provide all drug screen results. The mother supported the father on the grounds that he had failed to provide proper programming to the children and that he should continue to live with his mother while he was at the Ministry.  4) H. H. was the mother of two children born in October 2005 and was nearly four years old at the time of this hearing. The two children have been in the care of the Minister for Social Services for the past 12 months and H.O.S. was apprehended at birth as was the father. Both of the parents have had children of their own since they were born.

HELD: The order was granted. The children were to remain in the mother's care for six months and that the mother would continue to work with the Harm Reduction Methadone Program and take anger management courses. The father proposed that he would continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record, including 16 youth offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were dated between May 2000 and June 2008 and the last conviction was in January 2006 for which he received 7 months incarceration. As the mother had been on the methadone program for most of her life, the father was aware that she was prone to addictions and had signed a PSA stating that the children would remain drug free and provide all drug screen results. Although the mother was not opposed to the father's proposal, she questioned the appropriateness of the wording of the PSA as to whether it was for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. Regarding the father, he argued that he was not seeking a return of the children to the mother directly but that he had been advised by the Ministry that he planned on residing with her for the duration of the order and that if the mother did not cooperate with the Ministry's placement plans, he would be responsible for the children's health care expenses and the father would have to pay child support and the costs associated with the placement. The mother was to have regular weekly parenting time with the children and to have weekly two hour supervised visits with the father when the children were in the care of the Ministry. Although H.H. was represented by the mother, she did not testify and her history can only be gleaned from the documents which have been filed as exhibits and the testimony of others.","The Ministry of Social Services (the Ministry) seeks a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c.

He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

He entered the criminal justice system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence, drugs and alcohol he suffered while incarcerated. There were no less than 20 failures to comply with lawful court orders. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as they provide an insight to the accused's degree of impulsivity and inability to telegraph his behaviour. The accused's security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions while in prison. There is a reasonably grounded fear of serious and imminent danger which must be proved on a balance of probabilities.","[1] The defendant, R.N.S., is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

There is both subjective and objective component to his beliefs that must be established by the Crown (i.e. that he was assessed as a high risk to re-offend) and should therefore be disregarded. 2) There are common underlying principles applicable to both. R.N.S. is not charged with a criminal offence. No criminal conviction flows from person entering into such recognition. SCCA is designed to be preventative rather than punitive measures. While both impose restrictions upon an individual's freedoms, such restrictions are only those as are necessary to assist the individual from committing future offences or misconduct. Having the accused reside in the community without strict conditions is jeopardizing the safety of the young people within the community. The accused's high risk areas are: domestic violence, sexual assault, substance abuse, and sexual assault. He has demonstrated a lack of self-control and impulse behaviour. He did not sufficiently address these high risk issues, especially the substance abuse issue which affects the others.","[1] The defendant, R.N.S., is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. [35] I therefore find myself in the position where I agree with the beliefs and opinions expressed by all the Corrections, Parole and Probation Officers, the psychologists and psychiatrists, the members of the Parole Board of Canada and Corporal Teniuk in particular, that his fear that R.N.S. will re-offend in a violent or sexual manner is real and poses an imminent danger to public safety. I therefore, grant another recognizance to bind R.N.S. over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code of Canada. CONCLUSION [39] I therefore, order that R.N.S. be bound over on a third section 810.2 or 810.1 recognizance for a term of one year commencing February 25, 2013, on the following terms and conditions:

1. Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;",0.4797047970479705,0.61671469740634,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

The Crown now applies for third recognition. HELD: The accused is granted a security deposit of $1,000.00.  1) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP officer in charge of the High Risk Offender Response Unit and Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that the accused be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. 2) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal justice system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence, drugs and alcohol he suffered while in prison and he was at times subject to violence by other inmates. It was clear from the testimonies of the other inmates that he was a high risk to offend again. The Court also found that there was a subjective component to the accused's belief that he did not take the high-intensity programming because it was offered in the Penitentiary, when it was not offered in other federal penitentiaries. The accused was removed from the range after being refused release by the Parole Board of Canada on statutory remission after having served two-thirds of his last sentence for the sexual assault charge against his niece and the accused volunteered in cross-examination that she was recently charged with another assault offence and was recently acquitted of that charge.  3) The evidence presented by the accused contradicted other more credible evidence that he had not taken the programming because he was concerned about how other inmates would treat him and because he expressed a subjective fear that he would offend again and that his fears were reasonable in the circumstances of this case. The officer testified that she had no clue about when and what forms of counselling he took (e.g. whether it was for the first, second or third offence) and that the Court could not rely on her subjective assessment of his fear of offending again.","[1] The defendant, R.N.S., is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.",The plaintiff and his wife sued the defendant corporation for the return of a deposit they gave to the defendant. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and alleged that the defendant had misappropriated the funds necessary to construct the project. Both parties filed a dispute note and claim for the sum of $176.22. HELD: The contract was found to be frustrated and the plaintiff failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.  1) Every party is entitled to restitution of benefits conferred by that party's performance or part performance under the contract on another party prior to the frustration or avoidance. A just and reasonable resolution would require that the value of the expenses lost due to frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. 2) The plaintiff in the counterclaim submitted insufficient evidence to show that the misappropriation of funds was sufficient to repudiate the contract. 3) The defendant company was required to pay the balance owing to the plaintiff. 4) The court found that the plaintiffs had not proven that the claim of misaviation was applicable and the defendant company failed to show it directly or indirectly.  5) The contract between the plaintiff and defendant was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. Neither party could have foreseen this issue. The damages claim was dismissed.,"[8] The contract made on May 5, 2004 was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. [17] The Defendant in that claim, Pacific Home Products Ltd., filed a dispute note and became a Plaintiff in the Counterclaim against Dennis Ens and Anne Ens for recovery of the amount of $3,604.13, which they allege represents the losses incurred by Pacific Home Products Ltd. as a result of the frustration of the contract with Dennis Ens and Anne Ens. They then sued by way of Counterclaim against the Ens, Defendants in the Counterclaim for a balance, they believe owing to them, of $3,604.13. I find as a matter of fact in this case that it was not reasonably forseeable by either party. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. I find that the supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. [27] Based on the facts as I find them, and the applicable law, I find the contract was frustrated. I find that the Plaintiff Ens has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. I find that the Plaintiff in the counterclaim, Pacific Home Products Ltd. failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. [32] Considering all the facts presented in the case, I find that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. I find that Pacific Home Products Ltd. should bear 65% of the loss and Dennis Ens and Anne Ens, 35% of the loss. Further I find that the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.

7_1995canlii4340.txt,"The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle. The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level after trial. His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent was charged with failing a breath test. The stop was part of a spot check program (R.I.D.E.) whose principal aim is to detect, deter and reduce impaired driving. The officer asked to see the appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance and found that there was nothing improper about his driving. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser and gave him a breath sample without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The respondent refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. At trial, the RCMP officer testified that he was stopped because he thought the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The trial judge concluded that the stop was justified because it was urgent that the breath sample be obtained quickly in order to be effective. She found that s. 119 of the Alberta Highway Traffic Act, which authorizes police officers to stop vehicles, to require the driver to surrender his licence on demand, to 'bring his vehicle to a stop and furnish any information respecting the driver and vehicle that the peace officer requires'. The Crown appeal dismissed.  1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It was clear from the cases that when the execution of these general duties involves interference with a person's liberty or property, the powers of a police officer are not unlimited. The use of the word 'forthwith', that is immediately, and at the same time require the defendant to be subject to detention which is sufficiently lengthy to provide an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. Once vehicle comes to a halt, further authorization must be sought elsewhere in the Act. An impaired driver is a potentially lethal hazard that must be detected and removed from the road as quickly as possible. The ability to administer the test immediately helps to protect the public by detecting those who may be danger. The more accurate breath sample will correct the ALERT error. 2)The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyszer demand. While the issues were different in R. v","THE COURT: The appeal is allowed, the conviction restored. The Crown has appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer result under s. 24(2) of the Charter. When this is read in the context of the common law authority of police to control traffic on the highways, other provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and provisions of the Criminal Code, and note is taken of long standing customary practices, I am left in no doubt that s. 83(1) authorizes peace officers to require vehicles on the highway to come to a stop in response to an appropriate order, signal or direction. The detention was arbitrary, since the decision as to whether the stop should be made lay in the absolute discretion of the police officers. In these circumstances there was no improper intervention by the officer in conscripting him against himself or which violated his reasonable expectations of privacy. Accordingly I would allow the appeal on this ground and restore the conviction entered by Judge Crowell.",0.3773584905660377,0.3232323232323232,"The respondent was convicted at trial with illegal blood alcohol level while operating a motor vehicle.

His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by police officer in a bar. The stop was conducted in order to check licences, insurance, and, if not for a breath test, to look at the driver's licence and proof of insurance. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser. The respondent refused and the officer told the respondent that he would be charged with failing to provide a breath sample and that he was to lose and instruct counsel without delay. The trial judge concluded that although the stop was arbitrary, it was justified because it was urgent and that the breath sample be obtained quickly. The police officer's actions in stopping the appellant were therefore statutorily authorized by s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act. Issues Issues The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyzer demand. While the issues in R. v. Bernshaw arose from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejecting the results of an ALERT test when the police officer had not waited for 15 minutes before administering it, the same time period was relevant and the Supreme Court made a number of observations providing useful guidance. The gravamen of the case for the defence was not whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds for making the breath demand but whether there was a breach of s. of s.'s Charter because the search only took place following the arbitrary detention of the appellant. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed. 1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It is not necessary to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the duties of a police officer are expressed. The flexible approach struck the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The strong police presence in the area helped to prevent the spread of impaired driving. 2)The unreasonable detention and detention suffered by the appellant was demonstrably justified.","THE COURT: The appeal is allowed, the conviction restored.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault and whether she should have been convicted of assault causing bodily harm. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both charges. The Court stated that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Code. As far back as the case of R. v. Lepaski, [1989] S.C.R. 844, the Court spoke of the intent required for various assault provisions. The accused was convicted of mischief. In this case, the accused intentionally structured Mr. Cwynar in the face with a hard plastic object. There is circumstantial evidence that she broke the window. However, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","Background [1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar. There is circumstantial evidence that she broke the window, upon which I would say she probably broke the window. However, in my view, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. On this basis I would find her not guilty of the charge of mischief. [18] In the case at bar, it is readily apparent that the accused applied some force to Mr. Cwynar and as a result, she must at least be convicted of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. As a result, and at a minimum, the Crown has established that Ms. Fayant must be convicted of assault causing bodily harm. In my view, when an individual intentionally strikes another in the facial area with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. As a result, I must conclude that Ms. Fayant is guilty of the charge of aggravated assault.",0.5529411764705882,0.3411513859275054,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief.

HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.

The major issue for determination was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should have been convicted of one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the mens rea required for common assault is identical. All that is required is an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring the victim. This is simply not believable. The accused is guilty of both offences. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code.","Background [1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar.

The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.

This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court judge called a rather intricate kiting system. It involved some 37 different creditors interested in his affairs. The Crown took issue with the discharge and asked that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service work. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal was allowed. A conditional sentence was substituted in place of the conditional discharge. The accused was 28 years old at the time of sentencing. He had no criminal record and pre-sentence report suggested that he was low risk to re-offend. The conditional sentence did not reflect the gravity of the offence nor was it contrary to the public interest. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and further condition that the accused perform 200 hours upon community service.",0.5347593582887701,c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code.

For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year from March 1, 1990 provided that neither party gave notice of termination three months prior to the termination date. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The issue was whether the landlord had the right under either the Residential Tenancies Act or the Rent Review Act to unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the lease. The facts were not in dispute. The only restriction in s. 11 of the Act was that the notice of rent increase must come three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. The three-month notice requirement was not interpreted as granting the landlord the right to increase the rent in the middle of the term.

The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.

It is not sufficient to make general complaint that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect the services to thereafter be scrutinized in detail.

The information put forward by Cowessess should be much more specific. The affidavit of Ms. Tanner was filed late in contravention of Justice Kovach's timetable, even if it is considered it adds little value. She was not a Council member at the relevant time and relies on hearsay from current legal counsel. The evidence must establish the appropriateness of doing so. The applicant must be able to raise any concerns with the account within reasonable time. The respondent must be willing to put his practice on hold for a significant period of time to gather the information and refresh his memory on the multitude of files, attendances and services.

Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future.

The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.

The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity at the time of making his Will. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for trial to establish the 2013 will in solemn Form. The Court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. 2) There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect.

It is presumed that the testator knew the contents of the will, freely approved of those contents and possessed the necessary testamentaries to the Will in question.

In this case, the test is whether the evidence presented is sufficient to meet the tests contemplated within the procedural framework. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances of the defendant's estate and its history with respect to its five adult daughters. It was found that, in contrast to the present day, the defendant had been very emotional and appeared to be unable to deal with the concerns raised by the daughter particularly regarding her lack of mental capacity. 5) The defendant's conduct during the visits at the nursing home and at the hospital was of little or no importance to the Court as the issues were complex and did not accord with the standard of proof set out in the Ritchie judgment.

2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied on the ground that he failed to provide requested information as to his income. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was heard by the Assistance Board on September 6, 2007. The Department refused to cooperate with the application board and the applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $750.00 exclusive of disbursements. The Applicant intended to appeal the Board's decision based on non-disclosure. However, the Department was provided further information in October 2007 and the application was not reinstated until June 2007. If the applicant had the right to ignore decisions of the Appeal Board, the appeal board's function would be meaningless, as the Board had clearly stated in its decision to grant the application. In Dewolf v. Rent Review Commission (1982), 56 N.S.R. (2d) 403(N.S.)T.D.) where the court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Board enforced. There was also a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and a duty owed must not be discretionary in nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The board so erred that it could not properly exercise its judicial functions under the Act in making determination of whether the DeWolf's were 'persons in need' under the Social Assistance Act.

The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated.

The plaintiff bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the appellant, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in the proceeding. He bears the cross-examination and cross-examining evidence which is presented throughout the proceeding to prove his self- defence.  3) In Sagon v.

HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. There are good policy reasons in support of the conclusion that a victim who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. However, this is not the case in every case. The plaintiff bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defence. 2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the complainant, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in the proceeding. He was not asked his position on the facts of the case or the credibility of the adjudicative process as a whole.  3) In Sagon v. Royal Bank of Canada et al (1992), 1992 CanLII 8287 (SK QB), 89 Sask R. 16 (Q.B.) Grotsky J. wrote at p. 24: 'For a case to be considered frivolous, vexatious, or an abused of process, the alleged cause of action must be such that no reasonable person could treat it as bona fide and contend that he was entitled to approach the court with such complaint.' 4) Striking out an entire claim on- the ground that it is frivolous, torridious or anabuse of process of the court is based on an entirely different footing. Instead of considering merely the adequacy of the pleadings to support a reasonable cause of Action, it may involve an assessment of the merits of the claim, and the motives of the plaintiff in bringing it. Otherwise, the victim may not wish to report criminal activity as it may preclude his subsequent opportunity to proceed civilly.","[1] Maurice Couture, Sandra Couture and Windmill Greenhouses (“the applicants”) apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen’s Bench Rules of Court striking paragraphs 10, 10(a), 11, 12, 13 and 14 from Jim Windrem’s amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process.

4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is ordered for a total of eight months. There is no dispute that the applicant and the respondent cohabited for in excess of 2 years. However, the fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. The fact that the respondent and the petitioner cohabitated for some time and that the petitioner is a'spouse' by virtue of the Act means that she is entitled to interim spousals in the amount of $20,000, however given the short-term relationship and given the issues resolved sooner rather than later, these payments should be paid. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make interim child support orders in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. It is now clear that the Court can make interim orders in this case in relation to family property in favor of the applicant. 2)The fact that this Court may order person to provide maintenance for his or her child, in accordance with need, is somewhat cloudy. During the course of the chambers hearing, counsel for the petitioner further refined her request to an interim distribution of $2,349. This is the amount that counsel for Ms. McPhail holds in trust after certain property was sold. It was never contemplated that the items sold would be of significant value to the petitioner. The respondent, at this interim stage, ought not be responsible for paying child support and, if so, an indirect way to claim child support from her.","[5] Ms. McPhail commenced a petition on October 14, 2008, in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c.

Although Dr. Hunt did not specifically consent to Ms. McPhail’s application for sole custody, in light of the position that Dr. Hunt takes on the other issues, there is no opposition to Ms. McPhail’s request, and it is appropriate to grant Ms. McPhail the relief that she seeks respecting sole custody. [10] Accordingly, there will be an order that Ms. McPhail shall have sole custody of her three children, namely: Jordan Darcy Rex McPhail, date of birth January 9, 1993 (16), Mitchell Kenneth Lloyd McPhail, date of birth May 6, 1995 (14), Chase Aaron Joshua McPhail, date of birth October 3, 1999 (9). 1. Has Ms. McPhail established a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order? [23] In this case, based on the affidavit material before me, I conclude that Ms. McPhail has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children. Dr. Hunt may have stood in loco parentis to the children, however I cannot determine that on the conflicting affidavit materials currently before me. [25] There is no dispute that Ms. McPhail and Dr. Hunt cohabited as spouses for in excess of two years, and that she is a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. [32] Also, although the parties had combined incomes approaching $350,000 per annum, it appears that their assets, after deducting their liabilities, result in a minimal net worth. [33] Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, I conclude that Ms. McPhail is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from Dr. Hunt to Ms. McPhail, in the interim, should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. Taking into account all of these factors, the relevant legislative enactments and the legal principles that have been consistently applied in this province, I conclude that a spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is the appropriate interim amount that ought to be paid and should be sufficient to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. [34] Accordingly, I order that Dr. Hunt pay to Ms. McPhail the sum of $1,500 per month commencing September 1, 2009. However, given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, I order that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months.

HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits.

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action.

The AGC also brought a motion for dismissal of the proceeding on the basis that the defendant's claim was not based on a claim of loss of property but on an incorrect claim of seizure and restraint. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff.  1) There is no evidence that the undertaking gives rise to a claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. While it is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the plea. The amendments do not add nothing to the Statement of Claim that was before Justice LeBlanc.  2) The sufficiency of claim does not appear to have arisen from statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. The defendant's undertaking to respond in damages and costs results from the making and the execution of a special warrant and detention order. It does however appear that, once the criminal proceedings were over, the defendant did not seek forfeiture or remedy pursuant to s. 462.32 and 463.32 of the Criminal Code or any remedy with respect to the seized property.  3) It is well settled that the test pursuant to Rule 14.25(1)(a) is that the application will not be granted unless the action is “obviously unsustainable.” In considering an application to strike a pleading it is not the court's function to try the issues but rather to decide if there are issues to be tried. The power to strike out pleadings is to be used sparingly and where the action raises substantial issues it should not be struck out.","[1] The Defendant Attorney General of Canada (AGC) moves for an order for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that: Mr. Innocente, in this action, claims damages and costs in relation to the issuance and the execution of the restraint order on his real property and the warrant for the seizure of his personal property.

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed."

After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.'

(1) while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol he did operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and
(2) having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood he did operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

[11] Based on my findings of fact set out above, it is my conclusion that there was no breach of the accused’s right to counsel. The removal of the accused’s cell phone at the detachment does give me some pause for thought in that the accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it is clear from the evidence that the accused made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. I therefore find that the destroyed video evidence was of no relevance and could not have assisted the accused in making full answer and defence.

(1) while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol he did operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and
(2) having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood he did operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused did not receive a call back from his wife by the time he arrived at the Carlyle Detachment and his cell phone was taken away from him.

The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call.

The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.

The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the amount of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. 1) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) The respondent claims that he owned several machines prior to the marriage. Over the years he has owned mostly machinery of significant value. However, when consider the testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, it is my conclusion that the father is the actual owner of the tractor. He is not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it. 3) The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court will not take them into account. 4) There is a claim for $16,500 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor.

If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. The Crown put a street value of between $2000 and $2000 on the drugs and the respondent valued the drugs at slightly under $2000. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. However, the sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. Upon conviction, the first step he ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was “offence property” within the meaning of the Act and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission and the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. The trial judge found that “basically all of the money” to pay for the truck came from the parents’ bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. 2) The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The judge was satisfied he was relatively young and had no prior record. The father was depressed and remorseful. 3) The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. 4) There is nothing turning on the failure to give notice as the parents were fully aware of the proceedings and their interests were dealt with by the judge although he was wrong in his decision. This section allows innocent parties who have valid interest in the property to apply for an order of forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. The onus isn't met on the respondent who is a first-time offender with no previous criminal record to be integral in this particular operation aside from transporting him to various places across the country.

The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that it had correctly decided that compensable gradual onset stress required that there have been work-related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The issue was whether the Policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. WCAT did not err by considering whether stressors experienced by the worker had been unusual or excessive on an objective basis in the sense required under the Policy. This reflects the law which was in place before 2005. The Board exercised its policy-making authority to bring clarity to these issues. The Policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The only issue which arose was whether gradual onset trauma was compensable as a result of the policy. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level and found that GECA reflects the present state of our law. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having accepted that there were 'unusual or excessive' workplace stressors in the workplace, and faced with the evidence of a 'personal conflict and ineffective management' evidence supporting a causal link between those stressors and his stress injury, she failed to draw that causal link. There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. The question is whether the policy applied the correct legal test in light of the evidence in this record (the issue raised by the second and third grounds of appeal) is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. This is consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick.","Held: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [1] This appeal turns on one main question: in deciding the worker’s gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The appellant appealed on the basis that the tribunal failed to take into account the worker's subjective view of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view.

The question of whether the policy applied the correct legal test is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard; how it applied the test in light of the evidence; whether the Policy was wrong to apply it unreasonably to the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The policy is correct. It was not necessary to rely on the standard set out in the GECA nor did it require an objective assessment of workplace events or stressors. The objective view relates to the assessment of the nature of the events which the worker claims gave rise to the stressors, either because they fall within the express statutory inclusions (i.e., 'a wilful and intentional act' or 'a fortuitous event occasioned by a physical or natural cause') or because they should be included by judicial interpretation. 2) Before the Policy 1.3.6 was adopted, there was some inconsistency within the appellant concerning whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing the workplace stressors in the workplace. WCAT failed to give weight to the opinion of the respondent's treating psychologist in the absence of any evidence to rebut that opinion.

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","This was an action involving a contest between two insurance companies. The defendant, Canada Trustco, had in place two policies of insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The plaintiff failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. The insurance policy had been placed by the Owners/Mortgors, Mr. and Mrs. Jamieson, and protected both their interests and the interests of the Mortgagee. The Court found that in advancing their claim against the other insured company the defendant failed to make the distinction between the insurance policy and the subscription policy. As a result of two claims filed with the Insurance Crime Bureau, the Court ordered the plaintiff retain a solicitor to act on her behalf. Dismissing the application, that the standard of proof is still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability commensurate with the conduct alleged.","In reviewing the history of the standard mortgage clause, La Forest, J. makes it clear that such clause is not to be equated with what might be called loss payee provision and, thus, it creates ""a direct contract"" between the Mortgagees and the insurance company as would enable the former to sue in their own name alone and irrespective of the mortgagor. I am not satisfied that the Defendant has established on a balance of probability that there was any material misrepresentation with respect to the extent of the risk, nor any fraudulent behaviour with respect to the completion of the Proof of Loss.

The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house.

From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood; and having been found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine.

4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that the daughter was not living with her, that she was an alcohol and had an ongoing problem. She also filed affidavits from three friends and a 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was adduced evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even direction of the trial of an issue, let alone an order in favour of the father. Hearsay evidence in affidavits in applications for interim relief, it may do so only in'special circumstances', and none were shown to exist here. Accordingly, hearsay matters in the affidavits should not have been considered.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate.

b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.

He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

The appellant sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. In dealing with count 4, the trial judge learned only of the Crown's allegation that the appellant had driven while disqualified pursuant to ss. 253 and 254 of the Code. He also held that he would not be improper for the judge to preside over the trial on the impaired driving, refusal and obstruction charges. The trial judge in this case did not grant the application to sever the count as being nullity. It was remitted back to trial judge. 1) The Court of Appeal did not give the appellant's reason for not responding sooner to the severing of the count. It is inevitable that the judicial record will play a role in the decision making process. However, no reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of this trial judge's decision. 2) There is no normalcy of bias in the criminal justice system as a result of the convictions of mere mortals. It does not rise to the level of a normal judicial process. 3) The test for apprehension of biases in criminal law is well settled. The leading case is R. v. S.(R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 484, 151 D.L.R.(4th) 193.

She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible.

The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay at 6 percent per annum. 1)Had the plaintiff made continuing and diligent efforts to find employment, she would have been awarded damages in the amount of $924,000.00. 2)Had there been any doubt as to the nature of the employer's proposal, there was no doubt that the plaintiff had been rebutted by the employer. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of the proposed changes. There was no question that the employer put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her and it was one that she obviously could not accept. No doubt the employer wanted to get rid of the plaintiff. However, no reasonable person would have thought that such a proposal was insulting, an insult or degrading to an employee of six years whom the defendant had acknowledged merited the highest recommendation. 4)No reasonable person could have expected that the six month notice period offered by the defendant in relation to the length of employment would be extended to eight months.

He resiled from mediation but failed to resolve the Child Tax benefits but will receive a lump sum payment. He had financial assistance from his co-workers and social assistance benefits for a period of one week. 4) The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. Mediation never occurred, purportedly because he was unable to afford it.","He has abdicated a significant chunk of his care‑giving role to his mother and sisters. 109) It is my decision that the parents must use this summer to prepare themselves for a shared parenting relationship, one where the boys will alternate week to week in each home once school starts. The parents must participate in at least four mediation sessions with a family mediator to learn an acceptable way of communicating on children’s issues. The parents shall participate in a minimum of four sessions with a family mediator. 113) Commencing September 1, 2012, there will be a shared parenting arrangement whereby the boys will alternate week to week between homes. The father will pay child support of $324 a month for two shared children commencing July 1, 2012, and continuing on the 1st day of each month thereafter, until further order, or until the children cease to be children within the meaning of the Divorce Act.",0.3256704980842911,0.4663536776212832,"The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement has been fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father is 34 years of age and has four older children of other relationships, the Court has found him not entitled to the child tax credit, child support paid by the father of the two children and the Child Tax benefits and employment supplement are the only sources of income for the father. He has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the motor vehicle accident did not inspire him to adopt a spirit of compromise. He is currently receiving income replacement benefits from SGI based on 90% of his income. Although he has bounced from home to home, the father has been non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. The Court found him to be negligent in many parenting aspects, offsetting by his efforts to communicate with teachers and to have the home environment proposed to be provided for the children. There are red flags.",0.4831683168316832,6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office.

Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned an average of $55,120 per annum. This actual situation does constitute material change. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then he has avoided paying anything for a considerable period of time. In light of his recalcitrant approach to his support obligation, neither the passage of time nor the quantum of the arrearars should deter him from the fact he's avoided providing any meaningful financial support to his children and his former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place. 3) The Court must accept the original Order was correct and it was not made in 2005. It must then determine whether it should be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income that was said to have been earned by the respondent. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is unclear why he discontinued any interest in this invention, but it appears he was not able to find employment in his chosen field, or otherwise to continue to earn an income.

However, the court was not satisfied that she should be released from undertakings and agreements reached to date and that, in the context of her election decision, she should have been entitled to this right.","Result: Mistrial ordered. [1] Anne Calder brings an application for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown’s intention to lead newly discovered evidence in these proceedings compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. [3] The new evidence first came to Crown counsel’s attention during a lunch break last week, following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. She made important tactical decisions on the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case. [13] I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Ms. Calder has succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence. Prejudice [14] Ms. Calder has been prejudiced in a number of ways by this new evidence: [20] Having considered the matter carefully, I am not satisfied that I can cure the prejudice of late disclosure to Ms. Calder by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. [23] On the other hand, I am satisfied that proceeding with the trial without this new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and would not be in society’s interests generally because cases should be decided on all relevant and admissible evidence. The “truth seeking” function of the court would be compromised if I were to grant an order excluding evidence which the parties clearly recognize as important. Accordingly, and with much reluctance I have come to the conclusion that a mistrial should be ordered. [27] With respect to the corollary relief sought by Ms. Calder – I agree that she should be released from undertakings and agreements reached to date and that she should have a right to re-elect. [28] There has been a mistrial.",0.5843971631205673,0.589171974522293,"The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she sought exclusion of evidence or a mistrial. Mistrial ordered. The accused was relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings regarding trial process, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence at trial. She was entitled to re-elect. There was no mistrial and the accused was acquitted. The court was satisfied that the accused had succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence and that she had been prejudiced. The new evidence can be used by the Crown to impeach the accused's testimony and contradict things she had told to Sergeant Kelly in her video taped statement. There is no suggestion Crown disclosure is incomplete. The complainant made significant decisions regarding the conduct of her defence during her re-election process that affected her credibility. She made important tactical decisions on the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements to elect trial by judge and jury and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case. This would frustrate the truth-seeking function of the court when Crown non-disclosure was inadvertent. This is an important case because it could lead to the creation of new evidence which could be used to discredit the accused’S credibility. A mistrial would be unfair to the Crown because the new evidence would go to the mens rea element of the offences alleged against the accused and would affect her ability to defend her rights.",0.6359143327841845,7_2010nssc146.txt,"Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function."

HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances.

The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence.

The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61.

Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties.

The Court awarded the sum of $5,900 to the plaintiff and $1,000,000 to the corporate defendant. 3)Although the defendant denied any knowledge of round pillars prior to June 1994, he was aware that they were part of a construction project. He was struck by two things which were a part of his home: the pillars and the roof. It did not seem likely that he would then speak with his contractor about only the one. The plaintiff was obtaining advice from Slater from time to time and it makes sense he would speak to him about both the pillar and roof before speaking with Mr. Wist. It does not make sense to attribute the cost of the pillar or roof to any other person but rather to the defendant.","[1] In 1994 the plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence.

8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and had admitted in their evidence at trial that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets, that the only aboriginal right the Court should consider was an aboriginal right to fish for food. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Territory Order passed in s. 146 and s. 35. The accused offered a constitutional defence based on the evidence of his clients, Elders of the Metis, who had conducted interviews with number of people in the area, and expert evidence from Professor Frank Tough, Associate Professor of Native Studies at the University of University of Saskatchewan. The defence counsel for the accused served notice of the constitutional question they intended to raise on behalf of the accused on the Attorney General. The notice identified their aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada and included references to s. 91(24) and 146 of theConstitutional Act. In issue was commercial fishing. It was open to the defence to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginal right to Fish for Commercial purposes as opposed to fishing for food only. HELD: It was the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for commercial purposes because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purpose. The appeal on this point is limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4). It is the defence's prerogative to argue the case on the basis of the Aboriginal right that is in issue. 1) Commercial fishing is not an issue in this case. The facts at trial clearly established that your clients intended to sell any fish that they caught at Moberly Lake or Fox Lake. Therefore, the fishing is a valid aboriginal right. 2) The Crown at no time intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion. 3) It is not necessary for the Crown to prove anything","The appellant\'s notice of appeal sets out six
grounds as follows:

1. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by failing to distinguish between an
Aboriginal right to fish for food and an
Aboriginal right to fish for commercial
purposes;

2. That the learned Trial judge erred by
failing to hold that the Accused were
engaged in commercial fishing;

3. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by failing to hold that neither the
Accused nor any of their ancestors at any
time possessed an Aboriginal right to fish
for commercial purposes;

4. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by concluding that the scrip issued to
Metis pursuant to section 6(f) of the
Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 55 and
Order-in-Council P.C. 1459 did not
extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish
for food or commercial purposes possessed
by the Metis;

5. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by failing to conclude that the
requirement to obtain a licence before
engaging in fishing by means of a net set
out in section 26(a) of the Saskatchewan
Fishery Regulations does not constitute a
prima facie infringement of any existing
Aboriginal right to fish for food or
commercial purposes possessed by the
Accused;

6. The learned Trial Judge erred in law by
acquitting the Accused on the charge under
section 27 of the Saskatchewan Fishery
Regulations when neither the Aboriginal
rights defence nor the equality rights
defence had any application to the charge. He was
entitled to do so, and such a finding of fact should not be
disturbed by this Court acting on appeal. purposes. For the foregoing reasons, grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the
appeal are dismissed. The trial judge\'s finding that an aboriginal right to fish
existed in the Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan
separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title is one
he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. In considering whether a
licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the
aboriginal right to fish for food, there is no basis to
distinguish between the aboriginal groups with respect to what
constitutes infringement. A third consideration which does not arise from the
regulatory regime, is the departmental policy which places a
higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence
food fishing for Metis persons. However, once it has been held that the
domestic food fishing licence requirement infringes the
aboriginal right to fish for food, it follows that the
Regulation requiring a person to legibly mark that licence
number on the stakes is also an infringement that cannot be
justified, for the simple reason there is no requirement on a
Metis person in the geographical area delineated by the trial
judge, to have the licence. appeal.

The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of s. 26(a) of the Saskatchewan Fisheries Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against their clients. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an Aboriginal rights defence. Commercial fishing is not an issue in this case. It was the Crown's position that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he found to be established. It is the case that the Crown established commercial fishing was the issue.","The appellant\'s notice of appeal sets out six

The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division found that the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted as he was unable to work in the investment dealer's capacity and the consequences of not proceeding with the disciplinary hearing would be serious and irreversible. The trial judge reversed the respondent's decision to refuse to appear at the hearing and ordered the application to be allowed to continue. The appellant appealed. Allowing the application and holding that the test is not applicable in this case, that the application for interim injunction is premature. The court should be reluctant to interfere with the affairs of a domestic tribunal such as the I.D.A. It should be permitted to carry on with the procedures adopted by its members. Here, the respondent has his remedies to pursue.","This is an application by Donald Frank Ripley for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant in respect of charges prosecuted against the applicant pursuant to the constitution, by‑laws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application for the interim injunction is made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel of the I.D.A. which application will be heard in the Supreme Court Trial Division on September 6, 1990. The application for certiorari is joined with an application for an order in the nature of prohibition restraining the I.D.A. from taking any further proceedings against Mr. Ripley.

4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and cocaine and a knapsack with a large amount of cash. At a subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale and a black wallet were found in the accused's car and he was driving erratically. The accused was a student the previous year and was unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source. The police had found a backpack stuffed with cocaine and cash which the accused had placed at his feet in the back of his car. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of all three charges before the court.  1) The Court accepted the uncontroverted expert evidence that the amounts of both marijuana and cocaine were found at the street value of $100 and all of the circumstances establish that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking and so find. Possession of property obtained by crime (Criminal Code s. 4(3)) The evidence was circumstantial, which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from was that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. 2) The Crown did not call evidence, but argued that this was an admissible case in which the Court could not draw a direct inference from the evidence to draw a reasonable inference. The Court was satisfied that the three rolls of cash in the amount of $1000 were in his possession and that, because they were in small denominations, found on the same bag as large amounts and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was not present on the wharf at the time of the investigation they were seized knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. 3) The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused. The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt (as it did in this case) that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its presence and had some measure of control over it. It is also obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. 4) The accused is guilty of the following charges: personal, where a person has something","[1] Shea Patrick William Ernst is charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code.

The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

The appellant's affidavit confines the complainant's affidavit to 2004 and on. On the hearing of the application, the Crown's counsel confirmed that the complainant could not testify as to whether the complainant sold methamphetamine in 2003. 3) The evidence of Megan Bairos, a fellow methamphetamine user, who was living in the area at the time of the arrest, is not new evidence. It is pertinent to note that the appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. No notice was given to the Crown of its application for fresh evidence and the original notice of appeal did not make reference to the possibility of an application to adduce fresh evidence nor did it ask for an adjournment.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed (orally) [2] Trevor Drury appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

Even if do not believe the accused, but am left in reasonable doubt by it, an order for a new trial in this case would almost certainly result in the Crown being required to abandon the charges.(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief and that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to affect the result.",0.6142595978062158,e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province.

The Agency continued to visit the children and in January 2001, the Agency provided transport and money to secure the child's diaper rash lotion and product. In February 2001, two of the children separated again. The police made a referral to Children's Aid when N.D. was expecting her second child. There is no more information on this referral. It appeared to be based on caution, given the actual cause of K.D.'s death was never determined. All four children have been in temporary care with the Agency since December 2001. A further child (O.D.) has been placed in the supervised care of the Agency. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency conducted a summary or discussion based on all of the findings. In April 2003, a Child Abuse Test was conducted and the results of the Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test were published. In May 2002, a Family Skills Worker was appointed as expert witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. The child had a slight five code type. This code type is relatively infrequent and occurs more in women than men. These individuals are very comfortable with themselves and their behavior. As consequence they report mainly emotional distress and are relatively free of any disabling anxieties or guilt. They are in good physical health. They report they do not abuse substances. It is unclear when one looks under the heading, 'N.D's mental status' why it was necessary for the assessor chronicle whether or not she had tattoos and the nature of the tattoos.

The Agency found that N.D. was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining her children. She was found to have an anxious conformity and displayed some form of mental retardation. All four children were in temporary care with the Agency when the mother was expecting her second child. All three children had been out of their mother's care since December 2001 when the Agency advised them that they were in need of protective services and that they would remain in the care of the Agency if the mother were no longer living in the residence. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency determined that the child had a mild case of Aspergers' syndrome and that the symptoms of this condition were most likely caused by the failure of the parent to supervise adequately. Based on the evidence, the Agency concluded that it was reasonable for the Agency to consider moving the supervised access visits from the Agency Office to a more comfortable location in the Respondents home.

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional.

The second child, O.D., was 3 years of age. The third child (R.M.) was born in 1997 and lived with the mother and her grandparents until December 2001, when the Agency services were terminated. The Agency continued to visit the children and in January 2001, the Agency provided transport and money to secure the child's diaper rash lotion and product. In February 2001, two of the children separated again. The police made a referral to Children's Aid when N.D. was expecting her second child. There is no more information on this referral. It appeared to be based on caution, given the actual cause of K.D.'s death was never determined. All four children have been in temporary care with the Agency since December 2001. A further child (O.D.) has been placed in the supervised care of the Agency. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency conducted a summary or discussion based on all of the findings. In April 2003, a Child Abuse Test was conducted and the results of the Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test were published. In May 2002, a Family Skills Worker was appointed as expert witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. The child had a slight five code type. This code type is relatively infrequent and occurs more in women than men. These individuals are very comfortable with themselves and their behavior. As consequence they report mainly emotional distress and are relatively free of any disabling anxieties or guilt. They are in good physical health. They report they do not abuse substances.

The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.

The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the Husband would have interim sole custody and the Wife had access to the child through reasonable notice. The respondent brought an interim custody and access agreement in 1997. At that time the applicant was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a long-distance truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now worked day job in Saskatoon and the applicant changed jobs. She now lived in the home with her sister and had just recently been discharged from hospital.

The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk of a child exists), but proceed to a final order. 2)The applicant was granted access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:00 pm.

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the Canadian Armed Forces between 1951 and 1972 and who was discharged in March of 1972. The Plaintiff was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either under the Indian Act or any other relevant Act or Statute in force under the Canada Pension Act or other applicable legislation. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. All claims brought pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act are subject to a limitation period of 6 years. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that were individual to the class members. The Court was reluctant to deny a class member's day in court. 1) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England, if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. There is no suggestion that Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits after 1953. There was nothing before the court to indicate that they were properly informed of their right to do so. 2) The Court found that there was no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. There were no errors in law, the facts as stated in the pleadings disclosed no reasonable cause of action.  3) The Act reflects an increasing recognition of the important advantages that the class action offers as a procedural tool. It is essential that courts not take an overly restrictive approach to the legislation, but rather interpret the Act in way that gives full effect to the benefits foreseen by the drafters. The benefits which the plaintiffs say were not paid to Indian war veterans in the 'Class Period' are set-up for a class proceeding and will be available to all members of the proposed class. The continuation of the action in those circumstances would be inconsistent with the clear legislative requirement that the representative plaintiff be anchored in the proceeding as class member with no stake in the potential outcome.","[1] The plaintiffs apply for certification of an action under The Class Actions Act, S.S. 2001, c.

The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order.

The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the respondent was deemed not to be serving the youth sentence he was serving. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the Youth Court is the same as that of R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.). However, the youth justice court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision in the community. This is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) is only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. 2) Section 107(1) provides for an order under s102(1)(b) with any modifications that the circumstances require. It is not an order for review under s103. In fact, it is an analysis of the meaning of the word 'presence' in the context of rehabilitation and reintegration.

Appeal allowed; the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA. The fact that the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended under s. 106 indicates that this proviso cannot have been intended to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under a separate section of the Code. The context of the decision is the same as that in R. v. Zundel (1992), [1998] S.C.R. 45 at para. 33; HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The proper Interpretation of Section 102(3) is that s. 102(1) is the provision referred to by s.102(2) which sets out the principles of rehabilitation and reintegration and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the respondent in custody. The real question before the Court is whether the sentence was deemed to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the young person is now serving and, if so, whether the provincial director has the authority to order a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the respondent. 2) The Court accepts the appeal but accepts the Crown's argument.","Disposition: Appeal allowed [2] The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent’s sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired.

Conclusion [49] The appeal is allowed",0.4467640918580375,0.5882352941176471,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the respondent was deemed not to be serving the youth sentence he was serving. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the Youth Court is the same as that of R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.) However, the court notes that s. 42(2)(o) is a separate concept and is not a separate section. These sections may allow the issuance of a warrant authorizing apprehension, as that is the focus of s. 107. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in s. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. In other words, the courts in other cases have reached the same bottom-line conclusion as have. 2) The youth justice court judge focused unduly on the provincial director’s lack of authority to “suspend” community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision. This is consistent with the conclusion that young person should be able to escape community supervision without consequence. One of the central purposes of community supervision is to promote rehabilitation and reintegration. A sentence imposed after due process and careful consideration by a sentencing judge should be complied with in full. An interpretation of the conditional supervision, when it refers to s107 (apprehension) and 108 (review by provincial director) use the language “Sections 107 and 107” as an aid to the reader. In essence, s107(2) means the sentence doesn't run until apprehension, with the result that the sentence had ended prior to the matter coming before her for disposition.","Disposition: Appeal allowed [2] The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent’s sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired.

The penalty should be mitigated by his lesser degree of culpability, particularly since he had taken steps since the accident to improve safety at his farm.

HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v.

The plaintiffs also sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act in my view precludes this type of pre-certification notice. However, the plaintiff's request is novel. The affidavit was filed for the sole purpose of providing the evidence that the Roussys had settled with the defendant and therefore could not be viable parties to this action. 2) It is important to remember that we are in the pre- certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. An action is defined under s. 8 of the class action as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998' and Class Action is defined as an action certified not as a class action pursuant to Part II' and the defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there is no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The Court is not prepared to broaden the scope of the Judge's decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and implementation of The Rules of Court do not permit a cross-examination of a plaintiff on an affidavit as they do in other cases.

It is acknowledged by counsel for the plaintiff that they may, in turn, send out their communications in effort, presume, to 'correct the record'. 3) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 4) The purpose of the motion is to give further initiative to the court to look past the clear wording of sec. 2 of the SCC Act to'save the day'. The practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation do not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under the Class Actions act. 5) It is important to keep in mind in reading cases from Ontario that neither the section dealing with the service of notice (section 19 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act) nor the general provision allowing the Court to make any order considers appropriate (SCC Act) are limited to actions that have already been certified. 6) The plain wording of the two actions is that either the plaintiff is entitled to demand that the defendant provide information about other customers who may have booked through its office with Red Seal during the purposed class.

d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside.

The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours a week at a minimum wage and testified that she was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week.

At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial.

The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers.

The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01. The sole issue is whether the plaintiff is barred from suing in the province of Quebec because of a motor vehicle accident in Pictou, Nova Scotia. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non conveniens and at the same time the applicants have not provided lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether any of them are resident; whether there are police reports; whether they were seen by doctors; if so, where they are located.

If the plaintiff has chosen Nova Scotia, following the next rule, unless the defendant, that is the applicants here, can show that the question of jurisdiction of the forum will govern, the plaintiff's choice of jurisdiction will govern.

The application was also for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial, in the alternative to determination of the question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens.

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive the ATV. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving a vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. At trial, the Court held that it was not that simple, but the defence was clearly not exempting ATV's from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the motor vehicle Act. They were words used in s.11 of the Act to include an all-terrain vehicle, which was a prohibited vehicle under s. 11, but that is not the charge before the Court at this trial.","These facts were agreed and the only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.

The claim will be struck pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rules 7-9 (2)(a) and (e). For these reasons, the claim will not be struck pursuant to Rules 7-9 (2) (a) or (e) of The Queen’s Bench Rules. Accordingly it will not be struck pursuant to either Rule 7-9 (2) (a) or 7-9 (2) (e). [86] I turn now to my specific reasons for dismissing the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction ordering the CÉF to admit the plaintiffs to École de Bellegarde. 2. Even assuming that the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried, they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused. [89] Quite apart from the pleadings, the facts do not demonstrate that an injunction will be necessary to prevent irreparable harm. [94] For all of these reasons, the plaintiffs application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed. CONCLUSION [95] With respect to the defendant’s application for an order striking out the plaintiffs’ claim:


1. The plaintiffs’ claims for a declaration that the CÉF has violated their rights under ss. 12(1) and 13(1) of The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, both directly and as “collateral damage”, are stayed pending an application to the court pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. 2. The plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant has violated ss. 23.2(1) of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 is struck out. 3. The CÉF’s application for an order striking out the plaintiffs’ claim for special damages arising from alleged negligence in relation to the service dog, Tank, is dismissed; and 4. The CÉF’s application for an order striking out the claim for damages arising from alleged “intentional infliction of emotional and mental suffering” on Trystan Lawless is dismissed;",0.4579945799457994,0.4665676077265974,"The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. In August of 2013 the plaintiffs, as represented by the lawyer, applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF and their failure to encourage the children’s learning in French and to encourage their participation in the French immersion program. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its discretion.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw in s. 25 of The Education Act and found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not been discriminated against because of their disability. The Court awarded special damages to the plaintiffs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the application to dismiss the claim, the cost of training and re-training the service dog, notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff under the Animal Protection Act; and general damages for out of pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, costs of the training and refreshment for the children.",0.4665676077265974,e_2014skqb23.txt,"HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction."

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications.

Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation.

The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts, the application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in finding the application incomplete. The Applicant took issue with the development officer's decision to declare the application complete. HELD: The applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete.  1) the applicant received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, which was in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time it received the application. This decision is set aside. 2) It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The municipality relies upon subsections 278(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide as follows: an application for subdivision approval shall be approved if the proposed subdivision meets the road standards as they existed before it was received. The second requirement appears to be inconsequential. The grounds of appeal would have to be broader and arguably not covered under s. 250(3). The applicant insists that as a matter of law it had a right to have the final approval granted without meeting the higher road standard. However, the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received a tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes is opposed by the applicant.","The development officer has a different interpretation.

The fact that the applicant had failed to comply with the new road standards and one of the bearings on the plan was missing was a major issue for the developer.

Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs.

The issue of access was also disposed of. The petitioner claimed an interest in the standing crops but the respondent closed his case without further argument about calling evidence on the tax implication. HELD: 1) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declines to order any spousal support. 2) The respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the three natural children of the marriage. His income from his farming operation is $101,967 and he is responsible for $50,000 of farm income. 3) The farm partnership had the following debts as of June 9, 1999. The respondent is to pay one-half of the $96,600 paid to the petitioner by the respondent in his percentage based on the Guidelines. 4) The Court is of the view that capital cost allowance taken on machinery should generally not be added back for purposes of determining the income for the purposes of the Guideline purposes. The Court of Appeal agrees that $24,000 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase of the equity in the six quarters. 5) In the event the respondent fails to pay the amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the the petitioner, the petitioner may apply for judgment against the respondent for the amount remaining unpaid. The total costs of the van are to be paid by the petitioner in their respective percentage. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent\'s personal land.","[1] This issues for resolution in this trial are:
