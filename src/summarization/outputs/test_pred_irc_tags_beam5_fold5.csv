1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","This was an application by the applicant for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against him in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. HELD: The application for interim injunction was granted. 1)The court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances. 2)The test in American Cyanamid does not apply to these situations. 3)The applicant would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not granted. 4)The application for an order in the nature of prohibition would be serious and irreversible."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge did not consider the definition of weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. He founded the conviction solely on the basis the push dagger was concealed on the accused person. HELD: Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to consider the essential intent element of this offence. 2)Given the evidence, it would be inappropriate to enter an acquittal. 3)The sentence imposed was not fit."
1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the Act and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. Dismissing the appeals, that there were no Charter issues in these appeals and that the summary conviction appeal judge erred in allowing the appeals on the basis of Charter violations. Although the legal effect of s. 174 was argued before the trial judge, it was not necessary for him to either invoke or rely upon s.174 nor did he in finding each of the respondents guilty of the offence."
1994canlii5206.txt,"The Plaintiff, aged 72 years, claimed ongoing damages resulting from a whiplash injury suffered in a motor vehicle accident 5 years earlier. She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff suffered a whiplash injury which was substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. HELD: The proper level at the time of the accident was $18,000.  1)No evidence tendered in respect of her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident or that the accident contributed to her being so confined at this time. 2)The plaintiff suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Her physical therapist was not called to testify. 3)Costs of the action were taxed."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff was the successor corporation of an amalgamated corporation which included Sweeney Limited, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia based company involved in catching, processing and marketing of fish and fish products. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, the plaintiff taking the position that such savings were entirely unrelated to any advice from the defendant and were, instead, the result of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The plaintiff paid the defendant what the defendant called a service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings did not come from whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The default judgment was set aside as being premature, as it was obtained before the expiry of the time available to the defendant to file an appearance. It was difficult to see how the defendant was possibly prejudiced as it had already made it clear to the plaintiff that it was not going to file a defence in Ontario."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. When the third party order was sought, there appeared to be an urgent need to preserve the plaintiff's property. Trustees were appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. The plaintiff's solicitor/client costs to be taxed. HELD: 1)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances.  2)The Court was satisfied that the defendant's costs should be left to the trial judge."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendants and each of them did not fall below the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff's loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered. 2)The plaintiff's injuries were not caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. The treatment was appropriate and within the type of performance expected of an emergency medicine specialist."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other young men who joined him in the assault on the accused were also sentenced to probation. During the course of the assault, the accused was chased by the group of five and beat with kicks and punches while stealing his belongings. During his probationary period, he was taken to hospital with severe injuries to his eye and shoulder, severe bruising to his ribs, shoulder blades and waist, a fractured skull, friction burns to his temples and a damaged right ear were caused when people tried to tug the leather jacket up over his head and a knife was held to his throat by one of the members of his gang. The accused was given 180 hours of community service during his probation period, performing these tasks and assignments as directed by your probation officer. The Court found that the accused had some talent and motivation to become a productive member of the community."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT.

The two issues to be determined are: (a) was the respondent's proceedings in respect to the proposed hotel invalid by reason of bad faith; and (b) has the respondent met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting? HELD: The application for relief was granted in part. 1)The applicants were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the Council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do. 2)The applicant was a hotelier who operated a hotel in the community. The proposed hotel would be connected to an existing public facility and the proposed walkway would not be attached to that facility. 3)There was no evidence that the respondent had met its statutory pre-requisites for the public meeting. 4)Had the applicant met its obligations under the bylaw? 5)Had there been any improper understandings of the proposal or the meetings 'in camera'? 6)Had council acted in bad faith and without the degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of municipal government? 7)The court found nothing improper in the conduct of the Town Council and the applicant's meetings in relation to the hotel proposal. 8)The Court found no improper conduct or bad faith by the applicant.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. 2)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples' right to hunt for food, to the extent that it affected the appellants' 'Aboriginal rights' and/or 'Indianness' and must be read down in order to preserve its constitutionality under the doctrines of division of powers and interjurisdictional immunity. 3)It is not necessary to apply the test established by Sparrow and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The decision is not patently unjustifiable. The appellants have aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution. 4)The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and, if so, whether it is justifiable. 5)The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The doctrine of interjuria immunity was not triggered by the legislation. 6)The court found that the appellant appellants, like everyone else, are subject to the Saskatchewan regulation that prohibits night hunting with an artificial light except when hunting on unoccupied Crown land.  7)The evidence supports the conclusion that the legislation in issue does not infringe aboriginal rights but only curtails a method of exercising it which is universally disapproved by the holders of the right."
2003skqb550.txt,"The respondent seeks an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing her son from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent and the petitioner were married on June 19, 1999 and separated in January 2000. The petitioner had two children from two prior relationships. Her daughter Candace was presently 16 years old and her son, Dylan, was 10 years old. Subsequent to the separation of the parties consent judgment provided inter alia that the petitioner would have custody of the child subject to an agreement she had entered into with the child's biological father. The respondent would have reasonable access to the child every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening and one week in each of July and August. The parties agreed that the child would refer to the respondent as 'Doug'. The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from the province until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain such an order. It only provides that the respondent receive 90 days' written notice. It was finally decided that it would be in the best interests for the child to be with his biological father in Edmonton, where he would have immediate access to medical therapy; consultation with his psychiatrist and advanced modes of therapy including scholastic, which are only available in Swift Current, and Zyprexa, which is an anti-psychotic medication, to be prescribed. 2)The petitioner and her husband Culford have now decided to move from Eastend, Saskatchewan to live with his father and common law wife in Alberta."
2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","The defendants apply for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the defendants' amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: it is otherwise an abusive process of the Court; and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or a judgment to be entered accordingly. 2) The Court reviewed the procedure to be followed on an application under Rule 173. It found that the following: [i] a statement of defence is not a defence of self-defence; (ii) it bears a burden of proof; and (iii) the Court did not say that the crown had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt; nor that it failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defence. 3) It is not necessary for the plaintiff to be sued by his victim for damages in the event that he has to undergo surgery for a left corneal transplant and retinal detachment repair; or (iv) to bring a new action based on the same facts.  4) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the plaintiff, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act, 1982, alleging that the Government of Nova Scotia had breached its commitment to the appellant. The appellant's pleadings disclosed no reasonable cause of action. HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. 1)The Court recognized that if the appellant successfully appeals the decision to strike its claim, the Court will retain jurisdiction to decide whether the claim should be converted to an action. 2)The appellant's pleading did not raise a reasonable cause for action. The Court held that if an appeal from that decision is allowed, this Court would retain jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal to determine whether the appeal should be struck summarily. 3)The court reviewed the applicable legal principles surrounding applications to strike and found that, without challenge to legislation, a justiciable commitment on the part of the federal government and the provinces, enforceable at the instance of the CBRM. 4)The issue for the appellant was whether, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 (Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court, the appellant had breached the province's constitutional commitment to provide reasonably comparable levels of services to satisfy the requirements of s. 23 of the Charter. It concluded that the claim must survive unless the province’s proposed interpretation was found to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","This is an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant is disabled and has been a long term recipient of income assistance benefits from the Department of Community Services. The Board allowed the appeal and found that the applicant was 'a person in need' as defined in the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act (ESIA). The Board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. However, the Department continued to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27th to September 7th as a period covered by the Order of the Assistance Board's decision. HELD: The application for mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced. Regulation 36 was designed to apply to procedural matters where the appeal board perhaps made an order providing for benefits in excess of that allowed by the Act and the Committee would adjust the benefits to fit the legislation. The duty to the applicant by the parties sought to be coerced to do the act requested must not be of one of discretionary nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The Act was required to be done when the Appeal board released its decision, retroactive to June 2007. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $750."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with seven counts related to his violation of s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations. The accused had a fishing licence issued by Vendor 36640, the Prince Albert Co-op. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The Crown has conceded that the accused is not a member of the Executive Council. The issue is whether a person named Kevin Callele had the authority under the Fisheries Act to prohibit the accused from applying for or obtaining an angling licence.  2)Section 27 does not give the accused the power to revoke when a person contravenes the Fisheries regulations. It allows revocation upon contravention of Regulations made pursuant to the federal Act. 3)The prohibition is not valid on its face. There was no valid s. 27 revocation or prohibition in place so as to invalidate the accused's licence."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of assaulting the complainant and granted him conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, judge of that Court quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed.  1)The trial judge did not err in his reasons. He did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence resulting in a reviewable error. He focused on the fact there were two officers present and did not address the fact that the complainant had his finger in his face only once. 2)The Court of Appeal held that even if the accused's mistake of fact had been reasonable, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. 3)An appellate court must re-examine and to some extent reweigh the evidence and its effect, but must not simply substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial judge. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because it placed more weight on some portions of the record than others. 4)The accused was mistaken in his belief that he was being threatened and that his action was reasonable."

Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction, with the exception of few items to be dealt with by way of court order. Both parties agreed that the application for custody proceed pursuant to the counter-petition. HELD: The children were to reside in the joint custody of the parties and that they reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. 2) The Court must consider the interests and needs of each child and not the future costs of the new arrangement.  3) It is not in the children's best interests that they be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon. 4) There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines."

The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT.

The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The matrimonial home was awarded to the petitioner for $1,945 plus an award of costs of $5,000. 1)It was, prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties, the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. The respondent was employed by the public school system and had a permanent job. He had the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems. He would be even better off if he were to award the $25,000 to his mother. 2)The Court accepted the claim that the respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. 3)The petitioner assumed debts of almost $5k of which $2,500 must be credited to him, leaving a credit to Sharon of $500. 4)There was an accrual to a Sun Life policy during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at $8,358 for a total of $7,890 for $4,445. 5)The Matrimonial Home was divided approximately equally by the parties already and direct no further division or appraisal of those properties."

It then, as an appellate entity, was asked to affirm what was, in essence, a nullity. This it could not do. While its procedure was flawed to some extent, it did not specifically raise the vires issue so as permit the City to make argument on it, its conclusion in this regard was correct. 2)The Court was of the view that the answer to all three of these questions is no. On the facts of the case, the committee was correct and concluded that there was no jurisdiction for the Board to make such an order. 3)The court was also of the opinion that the Committee erred in jurisdiction in making an order with respect to issues not raised by the appellant's notice of intention to appeal. 4)Had the Committee err in law in ruling that the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the Assessment?

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Cost of Performance was to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value. 2)There was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. The plaintiff moved off this position only when he was forced to in order to effect sale. He was liable to pay for the work but was not entitled to the extras. 3)The cost of extras were to be treated as an extra over and above the contract price to be paid to the defendant."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to clause 15.10 of the lease quashed. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws. The tenant vacated the premises. The dispute arose between the Landlord and Tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. A dispute also arose about insurance coverage and whether insurance should cover the damages. HELD: The arbitrator was found not to have jurisdiction to deal with the issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification by the Tenant required or did a claim need to be made. 1)The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited arbitration clause. It does not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes involving clauses or provisions of a lease. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from a Landlord/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of the Lease. 2)The arbitrator is not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal more broadly with the provisions of that lease. The principles of waiver and estoppel apply as against the Tenants. 3)There is no evidence that the Supreme Court of Canada intended the widened scope of review of decisions of statutory tribunals to apply to awards of consensual arbitrators. The court concluded that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. 4)The Court concluded that, at least in the face of a strong privative clause, curial deference ought to be extended both to the determination of facts and the interpretation of the legislation statutory tribunal is empowered to administer. The Court should interfere only if the evidence viewed reasonably is incapable of supporting tribunal's finding of fact or where the interpretation the language will reasonably bear. In such a situation it would be inequitable for the court to intervene if there has been a patently unreasonable error in the performance of the tribunal. 5)The award of damages is subject to an arbitration clause pursuant to s.15 of the Arbitration Act. It is beyond the scope of the arbitration clause because it is not dispute about the clauses or provision of the leases. The award would withstand judicial review.  6)The court concluded for the first time that the Court favours restricted review of awards of a consensual arbitrator in keeping with its decisions in Volvo and Shalansky."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The applicant brought an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 to strike out the applicant's application. While she cited various forms of relief, the application was retroactive. The applicant sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. She also sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) There is ample evidence before the Court to determine that there has been material change in circumstances since the signing of the separation agreement. No agreement can be unilaterally changed. The only factor advanced in support is Melissa's loan payments for educational purposes. The need for additional educational funding was within the parties contemplation in 1996 and was provided for in their agreement. 2) The applicant has complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there is nothing to enforce. The application is dismissed. 3) It is well established that on an application to strike an action, assuming that the facts as stated can be proven, is it plain and obvious that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The essence of the application relates to child support and the form of relief anticipates variation applications. It eliminates the coming into effect of the guidelines as basis for variation. Otherwise it captures the intent and language of s. 17 of the Divorce Act. Only if the action is certain to fail because it contains a radical defect should it be struck."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004, the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. HELD: 1)It was the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in the proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the board of directors of the company. This is simply the right to instruct counsel in connection with such an action, it is not right to appear personally in court on the company's behalf. 2)The questions raised were whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry; if so, how is it claimed and are such documents privileged as between the Plaintiff and Defendants? Who is responsible for the cost of production of documents? 3)Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 4)Questions 5 and 6 were self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 which is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action. It follows that the common law is that a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609. As a corporation, the action is such that the plaintiff is and is obliged to instruct 609's counsel. It is also true that the action remains derivative one in which the action by plaintiff 609 proceeds for the benefit of the plaintiff against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. The issues of disclosure, privilege and reporting as raised by the questions are capable of resolution utilizing analogous proceedings without doing violence to fundamental principles in the litigation process. 5)Questions 6, 7, 8 and 9 were self‑evident. The first branch of question, and the first branch, were self‐evident as one accepts that the Unity of Interest between the parties and the interests of the 609 generally reflects the common view that a party's rights and responsibilities within the action warrant modification of the rules. The questions, together with the disparate positions taken by the participants in their written submissions, demonstrate confusion and misunderstanding as to the nature of the actions and consequently of a party’s right and responsibilities. Some of the misunderstandings have their genesis in the pleadings which recite the plaintiff to be Henry."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and deliver them. The truck was ordered forfeited. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part (orally). 1)The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. 2)Nothing turns on the failure to give notice as the parents were fully aware of the proceedings and their interests were dealt with by the sentencing judge. 3)It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed."

For distribution purposes, the Court fixed that value at $94,621.77. 2) There was nothing in the evidence that would lead to conclusion that the Court would prefer to order the sale and distribution of proceeds from something less than the sum of $95,100.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","This was an appeal to determine whether the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) erred in finding that the worker's subjective reaction to external stressors in the workplace was not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA; and whether the Policy was declaratory of the principles to be applied in this regard to all stress claims under GECA. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Policy did not narrow the pre-existing law. It was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. 2) There were no stressors on which the claimant's claim for gradual onset stress could be based. There was no evidence that the workplace events or stressors experienced by the worker were unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. 3) There was some inconsistency within WCAT concerning whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing the nature of workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. WCAT relied, in part, on two decisions dealing with traumatic onset stress (Logan v. Nova Scotia) and traumatic event (TNA). WCAT did not find that there were 'unusual or excessive' workplace stressors but rather that they were 'extraordinary and excessive' compared to the work-related events or stresses experienced by a worker in a similar occupation and TNA. 4) The policy set out the objective view of the law and set out conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Policy also sets out certain statutory inclusions (i.e., 'a wilful and intentional act or 'a fortuitous event occasioned by a physical or natural cause') or because they should be included by judicial interpretation. 5) WCAT applied the correct legal test in light of the evidence in this record (the issue raised by the second and third grounds of appeal) is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. The policy provides that the requirement that the stressors be viewed objectively as set out in the Policy is consistent with the law before the Policy; and, in interpreting and applying the principles required for determining the presence of unusual, excessive, and preventable workplace events, such as 'interpersonal conflict and ineffective management contributed to a toxic work environment'. WCAT concluded that whether the policy should be applied or not made no difference. 6) There is no dispute about the standard by which we"
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007. That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently, and she appeals to this Court against the findings. HELD: 1) The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. My task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging, had I not been able and inclined to rely on the bylaw inspector's findings. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. He could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. It was impossible to believe that he could have fooled her. He would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed her as credible, also find it hard to believe she would have engaged in such a tactic. 2) The Court rejected the evidence entirely. She was not credible and her explanation is not probable. The Court found on a strong balance of probabilities that there was a mould issue in the premises."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in an accident at the farm. He had been out all night at social event and had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. His failure was in not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a total penalty of $25,000. 1)A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances but this case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. 2)The defendant's failure was mitigated by his lesser degree of culpability. He also had no prior record for safety violations."

HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts.

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","This was a costs decision. The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent, the successful party, sought an award of costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff “A” of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. HELD: Costs were assessed against the respondent. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the respondent was the appropriate primary care parent. The appellant’s initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible.

The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that an adoption plan would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the agency lost confidence in the child's parenting skills and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought intervention because he alone could not care for the child. He sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Rule 1.04 of the Family Court Rules.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","This is an action by Redhead Equipment against Standard Transportation Services and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by the defendant from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by the plaintiff to these leased vehicles. HELD: The action was dismissed. The facts did not satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  1)There was no specific contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1993 until February 11, 1994. 2)The plaintiff did not establish that the defendant had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from the defendant. The evidence of the defendant gave notice to the plaintiff that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase or order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors. 3)Costs were also reduced from $63,267.49 to $22.2 for the unpaid repairs. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs of the action.  4)Although the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Redhead, it was clear that the actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. Although there may not be a strict legal obligation by a defendant to pay monies, it would be unjust not to make an award. 5)The facts of this case do not satisfy me on a balanced of probabilities.

The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field late July, 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief framed in argument. The applicant sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by Danka. HELD: The injunctions were requested on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive Covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. Relief quia tis requires the applicant to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka, and that the injunctions are neither borne out by the facts nor with reference to the public interest. The court found that Danka had failed to demonstrate that its right to relief from wrongs committed or threatened by the respondent was clear. It was also in the best interests of the respondents to avoid any basis on which it could even attempt to pursue a claim."

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her 5 year old son to the respondents. The child and his mother were placed with the appellant and the respondents pursuant to Family Support Services Contract whereby the Harrises were to'spend individual time with' the appellant in supervising and teaching her to properly care for the child and provide for his needs. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs here and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access. 1)The respondent had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of The Children's Law Act and therefore status, a decision with which, as noted, the trial judge then had to decide the issue of custody. 2)The court's role is not to determine broad social issues but instead, to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in s.8. The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not 'care' level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist, as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for her child, and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time. 3)The trial judge made no order as to costs or the respondents' cross-appeal for costs.

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992. They have two children, Conor and Braden. The Matrimonial Property Act requires joint custody of the children, with the Custodial Alternatives sole or joint custody, with specific access and a quantum of child maintenance. The matrimonial property act requires that the children have access to their father on a regular basis. The father is to have sole responsibility and decision making authority for the day-to-day physical care and control and the father has the exclusive access of the mother. HELD: 1)The Court confirmed that the father's next access weekend commences in accordance with the existing schedule. The Court ordered that both parents continue to share equal rights and responsibilities for major matters affecting the children's welfare specifically in the areas of formal education, religion and major health issues. 2)The present joint custody arrangement is not working on a day to day decision making basis. Having been advised by their lawyers of the advisability of resolving custody disputes by negotiation or mediation pursuant to s.2(2) of the Divorce Act, it was satisfied that all procedure and jurisdictional matters had been properly proven. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted.  3)The court ordered that the parties continue to have equal access to the children and that custodial alternatives '1. custody '2. specific access' and '3. quantum' should be ordered for the purpose of establishing the sequence of alternating weekend access."

After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners of Saskatchewan (the ""Board"") which upheld the assessment of sales tax in the amount of $37,842.07. The respondent appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision reversed. 1)The Board determined that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. 2)The assessment pertains to charges incurred by the appellant in contract with Valtek Controls Ltd. of Alberta. The purchase of the drawings was an independent transaction and was exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act. The purpose for which the documents were ordered was to be published and that they contain no advertising. The Board's definition of 'published' does not refer to the type of documents which the appellant purchased but rather to the purposes for which they were produced, distributed or made available, i.e., solely for educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes. 3)The board found that the application of the statutory requirements in determining whether a document is a book or technical paper is limited to circumstances where the evidence does not warrant findings of fact made by the Board. The alternative does not focus upon the extent to which the documentation is produced, made available and made available to a sufficiently broad audience. 4)It is the Court's view that on an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which is not always one of law. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 5)The appeal is allowed. The decision is reversed."

The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of the Labour Standards Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at the same conclusion. 2)Cajon acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that Cajon had not failed to fulfill its obligations thereunder. The adjudicator did not err in law in finding that the respondent had not frustrated or breached her employment contract. The appeal based on the submission that the employer erred in law by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated by the respondent's conduct was dismissed."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.",HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for wrongful dismissal. The onus of proving the existence of just cause always lies with the employer and it is not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the employee or dissatisfaction with his or her job performance.
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer after applying for and failing to receive final subdivision approval applied for and received a tentative subdivision approval in 1997. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The applicant submitted its last plan for final approval on March 14, 2000. The next day, the application was determined by the development officer to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The development officer therefore erred in law in finding the application incomplete. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan)."

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced by the Crown to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for 2 years probation, restitution of 1/2 of the overpayment and a restitution order against the paymaster who was to be before the courts shortly. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of the full amount rather than one half as submitted in the joint recommendation. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; Hallett and Oland, JJ.A. concurring. The Court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. While the agreement reached between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the Joint recommendation made to him was a fit sentence, the Court found no sound reason for departing from it. 1)Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal was allowed and restitution orders were amended by reducing the amounts ordered to be repaid by half. 2)Leave was granted to appeal. The appeal allowed. The restitution orders would be reduced to the amount ordered by the Court."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and s.2 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. There had been prior mischief complaints from the public regarding activity on the wharf and the officers approached several youth standing near vehicles. One of the youth approached the officers and asked who owned the vehicle. The officer indicated that he was going to search the vehicle for liquor and then found a large amount of cash in the back seat of the vehicle cooler. When the officer went to move a knapsack on the floor to check for further liquor, it felt heavy and he further could feel what he thought might be bottles contained within. When he returned to the vehicle, he found a backpack containing cash, a small amount of marijuana and a large quantity of cash, rolled in the manner used by drug dealers to hold their proceeds of sale. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is that the knapsacks were in the personal possession of the accused and that, because they contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, and because no one else had access to them, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. The cash was found in the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain: an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale and a black wallet. The bag was opened upon which narcotics were found together with cash. The backpack was not secured by lock even though a small lock was attached to the front of the backpack. Hence find that the defendant had them in his possession knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of The Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. HELD: In the circumstances, the court was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of the Government was clearly and clearly defined by Rule 19(24) of the British Columbia Rules of Court. The Government was entitled to know the case it had to meet.  1) The pleadings do not lay foundation for the claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. There is no allegation in the appellants' pleadings that the Government acted in self-interest and against the interests of either party. Although there is passing reference to the'responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government.  2) The Government is entitled to the facts as set out in the pleadings. 3) It is essential for the Plaintiff to reference with particularity the statutes and regulations on which he relies in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The Court found that there was no evidence the Government put its own interests ahead of those of the plaintiff in order to permit the action to proceed. 4) The court found that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to identify the legislative scheme by which the responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for the education of an individual person that included him was delegated by the Minister. The Minister was not obliged to provide particulars to the plaintiff. 5) The conduct in this case was clearly defined within the context of the Act and was not inconsistent with the rest of the claims made in the Statement of Claim. 6) There was no indication that the defendant had a duty to establish, operate and maintain the Residential School for children. In fact, it was the defendant who was responsible for establishing, operating and maintaining the school at the time and at all material times, the legislation governs its operation and maintenance. This arrangement is within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and, as such, the Plaintiff is not obligated to provide further particulars.  7) There were cases involving similar open ended phrases and the defendant knew or ought to have known that such wording was common and should be permitted by the courts.

4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","This was an appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation, the father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents, David and Vivianne Tindall. He further alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order set aside.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The claim is dismissed. The defendant was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff and did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiff. He did not consider the plaintiff's conduct inconsistent with the continuance of the contract of employment. The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff; the plaintiff breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff when he submitted his proposal. The plaintiff is entitled to no more than nominal damages. The court found nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the employer ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after he has secured the contract for their own benefit; if there had been electricians available through the union hall they could have undertaken the work being performed by Sullivan."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","HELD: The court granted interim relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, and The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The Court ordered that the respondent pay the petitioner the sum of $1,500 per month. The court found that the petitioner had established a prima facie case that the applicant stood in loco parentis to the children and that she was a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act.  1)Given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, the court ordered that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. 2)There was no dispute that Ms. McPhail and the respondent had cohabited as spouses for in excess of 2 years. The fact that one is not the biological parent of a child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. 3)Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The tractor was owned by an Alberta company and the plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were, at all material times, residents of the Province of Alberta. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in Saskatchewan. The plaintiffs sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiff's statement of claim accords with Rule 139 and goes, perhaps as far in particularity as the state of health of the plaintiff, who is still under treatment for her injuries and special damages for same as such are not now fully ascertainable. The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. This Rule contains at least two major purposes: first, to assess the merits of the case in greater detail then mandated by Rule 139. By more fully comprehending the details and nuances, defendant may, with the appropriate disclosure, assess merits of settlement discussions. Second, further particulars may be required in order to properly prepare for examination for discovery."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was to be mutually agreed upon between the respondent and the child. HELD: 1) The respondent is to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll. The petitioner's income is fixed at $11,376.00 per year and the respondent's adjusted income at $25,721.07.  2) The court ordered a charge on the petitioner's personal land as the net increase in the equity in the six quarters was $24,000. The court found that the petitioner was entitled to a portion of the land valued at $1,000 less the appraisals. 3) The Court ordered the respondent to pay 1/4 of the value of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the petitioner. 4) There was no evidence as to whether it was a proper farming expense which reflected the decrease in value over time. If it was partnership land, then his brother would have an interest in the crops. 5) The petitioner was to pay half of the costs of the farm equipment. 6) There were no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs. The Court declined to order any spousal support."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that [J.C.M.] should pay ongoing support for [N.G.K.B.] of $293 per month. The issues before the Court were: 1) Child support including s.7 expenses; whether the child support order should be made retroactive; costs. 2) Retroactive child support should be fixed at $1,500 based on the gross annual income of $35,269.44; the expense relating to the pre-school would qualify as extraordinary given [D.G.'s] limited income and the fact that she was only three months of age when she was separated from her parents and there was no prior spending pattern for this Court to consider. 3) Permitting the application for financial disclosure, that a $20 expense for kindergarten cannot meet such a qualification."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive pay: NOTE ON RETROACTIVITY All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. Employees who have retired from any employer during the term of the agreement shall be able to receive retroactive wages from every employer for whom they had worked during the period. The phrase in question was ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded that the phrase 'any employer' in the context of this collective agreement is an unambiguous one. HELD: The grievance was dismissed. 1)The competing aids to interpretation did not find the phrase unambiguous and the phrase was in error and indeed patently unreasonable error. 2)The arbitrator was unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history, which was minimal and not persuasive. 3)The union had not met the burden of proof placed upon it on the balance of probabilities test."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The Students' Union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to s. 222(d) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The students' union sought to overturn the Chambers judge’s order. The Federation and the Students’ Union opposed the application. They argued that the chambers judge had erred in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by Mr. Mowat and others about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the question before the Court. The fact that the students’ union was involved in the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation did not affect the appeal. It was not necessary to work through the merits of these arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, the Court was entirely satisfied that the president of the Federation was a “proper person” to bring the application as per s222(d). He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and served term as member-at-large on the Student Affairs Board. He was a member of the Student Union prior to the beginning of the campaign and at the time the actions about which he complained took place took place. The student body had concerns about the interaction between the Federation's bylaw requirements and its own procedures. The decision of the Board by virtue of the September 2005 amendment to the Elections and Referenda Policy was conferred very deliberately and was the key to addressing a wide spread concern on campus about a referendum and the loss of local control of the voting process. It is instructive to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum and to consider the issue of standing in this context to calculus based on bare numbers."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The mother's will supported an implied promise against revocation, which the father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after the death of his mother. The father sought costs of $38,750 on the basic scale if the value of the condominium is used as the 'amount involved' and $26,750 if one-half value, the amount originally at issue, is used. There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of the mother's estate to provide an accounting. The central issue in the father's application was not about the meaning of his daughter's will but about the difficulty, conflicts or ambiguities which give rise to the litigation are either in whole or in part, the fault of the testator's family maintenance; the late Mr. Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the estate and the wills he drafted; there were reasonable grounds for the litigation such as proof in solemn form; where suspicious circumstances are demonstrated; where the court's scrutiny or supervision is warranted."
6_1993canlii4548.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of contract of a written contract between the parties and damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff. HELD: The action was dismissed without costs to any party. 1)The plaintiff was in the business of manufacturing, selling and leasing commercial signs and had a construction facility in Toronto, Ontario. The defendant sold and services tractor trailers and other large trucks in Nova Scotia, particularly in the Truro area. The plaintiff had previously operated its business on the Brookside Road, north of Truro, and in 1984 moved to a new location adjacent to the McClure Mills Interchange. Since the approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void and the defendants were not liable for any breach of the contract. 2)The defendant was aware of the concerns of Nova and allowed the erection of the sign without knowing if approval would or would not be granted. Nova was fully aware of its situation from the beginning and took advantage of the benefit for some 74 months as it moved from the plaintiff's building to the defendant's new location. Nova did not prove the appropriate legislation and regulations but was found to have dealt with some of the other claims advanced in the counterclaim. 3)The court dismissed the claim on the basis of a reasonable monthly rental which it found to be the sum of $875 per month plus any provincial sales tax, less some deductions and less monies paid."

Dismissing the application, that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision.","This was an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant's application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children's Aid Society shortly after his birth. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence on appeal was dismissed. 1) The evidence was either available at the trial and was not adduced; or (ii) was repetitious of evidence given at trial and is not new. The evidence should be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of believing; and (4) It must be credible. If believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence, be expected to affect the result.  2) The fresh evidence rule has been stated many times and is summed up in R. v.

6_1999skqb18.txt,"An application to strike out the third party claim as not disclosing a reasonable cause of action. The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence. (2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.","This is an application by the City of Saskatoon and William Hewitt (the third parties) to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The claim is advanced in contract and in tort. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The provisions of s. 136.1(2) of The Urban Municipality Act and s. 34 of The Fire Prevention Act prevent the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties in this case and, if so, should the entire third party's claim be struck out pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a)? 2) The Court must assume that every allegation of fact in the statement of claim is true, even if it appears to be a very unlikely allegation that will be difficult to prove. 3) The court must not embark on a determination as to whether the defendants did what they did with reasonable care or omitted to do what was to be done in good faith.

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","This was an action by the plaintiff, Ciaussen Walters and Associates Limited, for damages for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. At the end of the trial, the plaintiff asked to withdraw his claim against the defendant, Hardy Appraisals, for costs which were sought by defence counsel reserved upon that issue until later date. HELD: 1) The plaintiff carries on business as licensed real estate broker with an office in Lunenburg. The defendant is retired heart surgeon and resides with his wife, Sonia, at Halifax. 2) The defendant began to reside at Kingsburg as seasonal resident in 1973. He acquired many parcels of land in an area known as Hell Point. The transactions were negotiated privately between the defendant and the various owners of the lots. The commission was 10% inclusive of project management and payable upon sale. In the absence of an enforceable agreement between the parties, the Plaintiff is entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. 3) There was an oral agreement for payment of a fixed commission, there were definite terms, that the oral agreement was enforceable but in alternative an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. 4) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff did not intend to be bound by the terms of the agreement.  5) The issue of the commission came up in the discussions with Deirdre and Robert. They enjoyed meeting with each other and went away with better under-standing of their perspective on the project.

6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order refusing to appoint Dr. Miller a court expert and refusing to order him to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part per reasons for judgment of Hamilton, J.A., and Cromwell, JJ.A.; the chambers judge considered this issue of opinion and I am satisfied he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the appellant cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment."

Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

HELD: 1)The plaintiff has a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice. This right is subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non conveniens and that a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. 2)The notice of application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. 3)The substantive law which governs will be the law of the place where the accident occurred. Nova Scotia is a forum non- conveniens. 4)If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from a procedural law before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of that place of trial and that is Nova Scotia. 5)The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum conveniens or police whether report was filed; whether anybody investigated the accident; whether there were any witnesses and where they were located; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors and, if so, where they are located and whether they might be called to testify at trial. 6)The applicant did not provide a lot of information about the accident such as whether any of the witnesses were resident or where they may be resident. The applicants have not provided any information about whether there are police reports; whether they were seen by a doctor and if so; if they were in the city. 7)It is an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial in the province of Quebec and, as I have previously stated, the rule is that the substantive law that governs the law is the law in the Province of Quebec.

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The accused was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","This is a divorce proceeding between Jodie and Allan. The parties began cohabitating in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 2004. The parenting and support issues concerning Ella have been resolved. The issue for the Court is whether Tristen is a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). HELD: The threshold for a finding of parental status is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of parent in substantial substitution for the natural parent's role.

The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father.

The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has had a significant portion of his care-giving role to his mother and sisters. The parties met in 2000 when the mother was working in bar. She was concerned that the father was staying late and leaving the boys on their own. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father is entitled to child support and child support paid by the fathers of her older children, he abdicated a significant chunk of his responsibility to the mother and sister. His unfortunate injuries in the past two years have made him non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. The only other outcome of the pre-trial conference was an agreement to pursue mediation. 2) The father is not entitled to the Child Tax credit for all the children, and for that purpose shall take into account: (i) the quality of the relationship that the child has with the person who is seeking custody and any other person who may have close connection with the child; (ii) the personality, character and emotional needs of the children; (iii) the capacity of the father to help the children with homework; (iv) the home environment proposed to be provided for them; (v) the plans that the hotel management company ended the arrangement in March because he did not like the way the children were living there; (vi) the father's inability to explain how he came to be indebted to Revenue Canada; ( iii) the fact that the children lived with the mother's sister (who was also a social worker) and his inability to communicate with his sisters (who were also social workers) when he was in a serious motor vehicle accident, and (viii) he resiled from an agreement with the hospital. (vii) The court found that it was appropriate for the Court to consider the best interests of the parties and to award the boys a portion of the child support they were entitled to in the interim order. 3) There are few rules. Jake is content to let the boys make choices without supervision or follow-up. He abdicates a significant part of his caregiver role. He has been non‑ambulatory. He tried to live with his co-workers (through fund-raiser) but failed to do so.

6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

HELD: The accused is remanded to November 12. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions comprised of: 12 assault related, 12 sexual assault, and 1 common assault offence. He is now assessed as high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. 2) There is a subjective and objective component to his belief that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years. There is an objective component that must be established by the Crown (i.e. that an objective person armed with the same knowledge as the defendant would agree that his fears are reasonable). 3) His most recent breaches are minor in nature and should not be taken too seriously in deciding whether further restrictions need to be placed upon him. The Court found that the accused has a subjective belief that he will commit a'serious personal injury' offence or a'sexual assault' offence. The evidence that he did not take the high intensity training and that only moderate training was offered by the Penitentiary is reasonable in the circumstances of this case."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not made an issue for trial. 1) The Court found that it is not necessary for challengers of will to present evidence that will convince the court as to the merits of their case. Rather, it is necessary only to satisfy the court that there is a genuine issue to be tried with respect to the grounds on which the challenge is based, such as lack of testamentary capacity or the presence of undue influence. 2) There is no evidence of irregularity or evidence on the peripheral points which will lead the Chambers judge to conclude that the evidence itself is not in dispute and the propounder of the will reassumes the legal burden of establishing a testamentarian capacity. 3) The court concluded that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. The Court held that the test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of the testator and the validity of the Will. The test in Dieno is the same as in Ritchie: the presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on those attacking the will."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years and had no children. During the marriage, the wife spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. At the time of separation, she suffered a miscarriage. She sought periodic maintenance to allow her to upgrade her education so that she would become financially independent. The parties divorced in 1989 and the wife now sought to enroll in a Certified General Accounting course. The wife had concerns during the marriage that she was underpaid and was under-employed. She now sought interim maintenance. HELD: The application for interim maintenance was dismissed. 1)To move matters along towards the goal of financial independence and considering the means, and needs, and circumstances of each spouse, acknowledging that this may not be the basis for a lump sum or monthly periodic maintenance being made at the time the divorce is heard, I find there is some causal relationship between the wife's attempts to obtain a new car and the fact that she did not upgrade her Education. 2)The Court awarded the requested amount of $500 per month maintenance.

7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward final agreement would constitute separate, independent, binding and enforceable agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce. 2)The intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear."

The officer asked the appellant to accompany her back to the police cruiser and gave him a breathalyzer demand without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The appellant failed the test.

HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction was restored and the appellant's s. 10(b) rights were infringed.  1)There was no evidence that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand. 2)The officer's actions in stopping the appellant were not random but were based on the fact that he could detect alcohol on his breath and could smell the odour of alcohol coming from the vehicle. 3)The Court held that s. 189a of the Highway Traffic Act on the right not to be arbitrarily detained and to be free of unreasonable search and seizure was a reasonable price to pay for the privilege of driving."

The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendants for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. HELD: An application for severance of the issues was granted. It was arguable that the plaintiffs may well be disentitled from their right to have a jury decide what is the appropriate quantum of damages. 1)The Court held no jury could be reconstituted some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial. 2)No jury, whether discharged or not, can be reassembled some time after carry-on with the trial of the separate issue. This would require, an examination of the injuries and how they are sustained. Such an examination would result in a repetition of this costly expert testimony and if not properly considered would prejudicial to the plaintiffs. 3)The issue of liability should only be granted for the most compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable the trial will put an end to the action."

The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters.

The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt was in bankruptcy for 28 months. He contended that the failure of his former business Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways. He alleged that the business failure combined with pressure from creditors such as the Michaluk's caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. HELD: 1)There was an investigation conducted by the R.C.M.P. as a result of the superintendent's investigation order and a conditional order of discharges requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee. 2)The principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances of the bankrupt. Based upon the evidence and submissions, the bankrupt was not satisfied that any of these facts had been proven. The'my way or the door way' attitude used by the bankrupt is nothing more than bullying tactic used by a common law spouse to justify her failure to honour an agreement. 3)The evidence would not support a successful prosecution.  4)The bankrupt submitted that this was a final matter and Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules required affidavit evidence must be based upon personal knowledge."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the credit union held a security interest. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that was actually recovered. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. 2)The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages for unjust enrichment in the same amount as the damages determined in connection with the tenancy at sufferance issue. 3)In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intention to do so. It would be improper for Gari to deny permission to remove the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. That stance would have been inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the Public Property Safety Act. 4)Gari's claims in this regard must fail."

Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage.

The AGC argues that notwithstanding a finding of action, the plaintiff’s amended Statement of Claim does not reply to the claim that is made by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order.  1) There is nothing novel about the action given it is rooted in legislation.  2) The plaintiff was convicted of conspiracy to traffic and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. He hangs this claim on the fact that the crown did not push the matter all the way to forfeiture and, instead, returned it to him in 2004. He does not provide authority for his position that failure to proceed to forfeiture triggers these undertakings."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The issues include parenting, child support and spousal support. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 16, 2012, including Exhibit A which is captioned as Minutes of a Four-Way Meeting. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. 2) The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. 3) The parties have three children. The petitioner cohabitates with a woman who is employed full-time but assumed for present purposes that she is not at this time a common law partner for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. While it may be that parties in a settlement meeting reach a consensus on a number of issues, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties. 4) The court struck the last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit A of Exhibit A from the petitioner’s affidavit. The court concluded that the whole of the settlement process is protected, that is, all communications in furtherance of settlement from the first utterance or letter to the last. 5) The Court concluded that while they may have reached an agreement on seven issues, they did not reach agreement on all issues. The circumstance at hand is to be distinguished from an application to enforce a settlement agreement where it is alleged that all issues have been settled.  6) The policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issue have been resolved, privilege continue to extend. If there may be a consensus in the party that is a party to the income tax act, it could have a bearing on the ability to claim the AED tax credit.  7) It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; if they do, the court may seek to set monthly payment on account of any arrears which might exist as of the date of this order. 8) Once entitlement is determined, the Court must be guided by the factors set out in the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","At issue in this case was whether the admission of hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The medical evidence established beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. The only issue was the identity of the person who had committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found that the sexual assaults with which we are concerned are really the acts of intercourse, yet all the complainant told Miss. V. was that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. Over the time frame covered by the information he was left in little doubt that opportunities could and did present themselves for E.L.H. to have had a relationship with the complainant. Although such an error was so grave that it was not necessary to quash the conviction, it was necessary to re-examine and consider the effect of the evidence. 2)The evidence of an expert was admissible. The Court concluded that the verdict of the trial judge was one that he could reasonably have reached on the evidence before him."

The average income of the respondent over the past three years was approximately $180,000.

The applicant claimed special monthly expenses of $1,200 to cover nanny and child care costs, $125 for medication, $25 for recreation and $200 for a university fund. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay $1,794 per month. Section 4 of the guidelines was applicable. The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the Respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986. Both parties are medical practitioners and each enjoys significant income. The applicant earned approximately $180,000. HELD: 1)The applicant was to be responsible for approximately 2/3 of the monthly maintenance. 2)The significant income enjoyed by the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration when determining the proportion of extra-ordinary maintenance requested. 3)The less income tax benefit available to the petitioner 3,000/1,000 was used to cover nanny and child care expenses. 4)The claim for recreation and a university fund are expenses that are'special' or 'extra-ordinary' and should be paid monthly. 5)Costs for nanny were reduced to $1,200 per month pursuant to s.7(1)(a) of the guidelines and the claim for medication was justified pursuant to S7(c)of the guidelines. 6)The respondent was to pay additional maintenance to cover special or extraordinary expenses. 7)The amount of maintenance was increased to $2,076 per month."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial in Provincial Court on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an aboriginal right to be fishery. The respondents were Metis and resided at a reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake in northwestern Saskatchewan. At trial, counsel acting for the respondents advanced standard criminal law defences to the charges, and also a constitutional defence that the respondents as Metis had an aboriginal rights to fish. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 but for the constitutional defence which he found to be established. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It is not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against your clients. There was no evidence upon which the Crown could build a case of commercial fishing. 2)The Crown had no intention to change the issues at this time and to argue in your Brief an issue which was not argued at trial. It is the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for commercial purposes, because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to a commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for a commercial purposes. 3)The Court found that the Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The conviction is set aside and a new trial in the Provincial Court is ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. 2)The Court of Appeal has taken the Pelletier case directing that new trial be ordered."
8_1999canlii12948.txt,"FIAT. The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received. There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct. No fiduciary duty was owed to the applicant when the solicitor accepted the documents from the applicant's husband. The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping. The husband's solicitor had forwarded the documents to the applicant's lawyer.

The applicant seeks an order declaring that the solicitors for the plaintiffs have breached confidentiality and are in conflict of interest between clients.

HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs. 1)No solicitor-client relationship was created between Lois Hudson and the law firm of Politeski Strilchuk Milen when, what proved to be confidential documents, were received by her from Neil Hudson. There was no fiduciary duty resulting from the acceptance of the documents from Lois Hudson. 2)No other duty was owed to Lois Hudson as Lois Hudson was not acting on behalf of anyone other than her husband. No other duty existed relating to the firm which she was a member of. 3)Since no solicitor relationship and no other duty were owed by Lois Hudson to Lois, no other relationship existed relating her law firm. No matter what role she was given by Neil Hudson, she was not required to take any action or to refrain from doing anything. The fact that Neil Hudson now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not change the situation that existed in 1995.

8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender, which resulted in the contract being awarded to Nielsen Ashdown who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. HELD: The plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by bringing on board an experienced sub-contractor, a fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation. The contract was ultimately awarded to another tenderer who had better experience in Saskatchewan on similar spraying programs in subsequent years. 1) With the benefit of hindsight, it now appears that the plaintiff had compensated by making arrangements to bring on board another experienced operator with unfavourably rated planes, regardless of the fact it was the lowest tenderer on the project. 2) It is settled law that the submission of tender in response is given rise to contractual obligations—depending upon whether the parties intend to initiate contractual relations by submission of a tender. 3) The plaintiff was treated fairly and in accordance with common industry practice. The implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist together. While costs usually follow the result, this is an appropriate case in which to disallow costs to the successful party."

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, S.C. 1990, c.21 (the “Act”) and the “Health of Animals Regulations” resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.

Under those circumstances the Court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of this order or the last variation order effective on a date prior to the date of the last order. 1) The applicant's income for child support purposes was $18,593. It was a recurring income figure over the past four years, including 2008. It is not an adjustment contemplated by Schedule III. 2) The parties agreed to share in proportion to their respective incomes the net cost of child care expenses incurred for the children of the marriage taking into account any subsidies, benefits or income tax deductions or credits relating to the childcare expenses. 3) The Court was prepared to give the applicant another year, that is to say until the end of 2010 to show meaningful profit, and by then, be in position to provide the Applicant with an income by way of employment income or dividends.

The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997.

The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) and s. s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The accused was released from custody on a voir dire basis. The evidence was applied to the trial proper. The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the accused had not waived his right to counsel. The court concluded that there was a waiver of the accused’s right to a reasonable opportunity to choose his own lawyer and that the officer had not met any onus on it to establish that he had waived his rights."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. The applicants had been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the medium security Saskatchewan Penitentiary until they were both transferred this year to the minimum security federal penitentiary. Both had suffered three strokes since 1993 and suffers from mercury poisoning. Although institutional charges may sometimes lead to security reclassification of an offender, Richer has remained assessed as a minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security. Both of the applicants are seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the prison service which do not impact their residual liberty. While the applicants have framed their application under the pretence of habas corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certification, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of prison. The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the correctional service of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. HELD: The Court declined its jurisdiction in granting a remedy on the application guised as an application."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. She suffered from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash on her chest. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The statement of claim does not disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, in both tort and contract and it is appropriate for this Court to assume jurisdiction in respect to the claim as it relates to that particular defendant. 2)There is no causal connection between the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's injuries. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. However, there is an allegation which suggests link between the alleged failure to disclose and the plaintiffs injuries. 3)There are allegations which must assume a factual basis to justify assuming jurisdiction over the claim. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party, but theliability attaches because of the relationship such as an employer-employee, or principal agent. If fault is found to be directly attributable to The Dow Chemical, then thereis a causal connection. 4)The statements of claim do not disclose a fault attributable to either the defendant or the Dow chemical Company. Rather, they disclose a causal relationship between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. She appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: 1)The death benefit is 50% of the deceased's actual gross yearly employment income. The 'weekly income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 of the Act is one-half the 'income replacement benefit'. The ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis. 2)The amount of income earned, without any limiting maximum, is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The interpretation suggested by SGI is appropriate when calculating the benefit for dependent children."
9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. The accused was 19 years old at the time of the accident and had a minor youth record. He had been involved in a night of drinking and partying without sleep and was in no shape to drive. He was fined $250 and placed on probation for 90 days. The Crown suggested a sentence in the lower end of the range and that a conditional sentence should be served in the community rather than in a corrections facility. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre. 1)The Court noted that the accused's actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to drive in normal fashion resulted in the death of his passenger. 2)The accused's driving was described as erratic, erratic and bizarre. His driving was mechanically unsound and he took the risk of running into a concrete barrier. 3)The court noted that in almost all of these instances the accused was consuming alcohol and that consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause of the fatality or a contributing factor. 4)The sentence imposed was for a period of 18 months."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Act”) which:(a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors in relation to a claim in Queen’s Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina; and(b)rests the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation thereto. The respondent argued that if the entire proceeds from the Action were disposed of, the petitioner would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family. HELD: 1)The sum of $40,000.00 will likely be sufficient security for the claim under the Act. It is ordered to be paid in installments. 2)The respondent has only one asset at this time that might give him an ability to satisfy the Act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. There is no persuasive evidence that upon success in his Action the respondent would not voluntarily ensure that any claim is satisfied, because the petitioner has not met the tests that governs the granting of such orders. The criteria for granting a preservation order are identical to those that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. The balance of convenience (i.e. the risk of injury to the plaintiff if the injunction is not granted, versus the probability of harm to the defendant if it is) favours granting the interim order."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The accused was convicted of driving while impaired contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. She also failed to give a correct legal effect to the facts. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. 2)The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with. 3)The judge made no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law, her application of the applicable law to the evidence and her approach to the issue of impairment.  4)The Court was satisfied that the judge's conclusions of fact were consistent with the facts and that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment was proven, which is the next issue to deal with, the Crown relied on the presumption afforded by s. 258 of the Code."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants seek injunctions against the defendants, return of property taken by the defendants and damages for breach of contract and disgorgement of all profits gained through the breaches of fiduciary obligations. HELD: 1) The defendants are granted their application to have the plaintiffs' claim severed so that the threshold issue of liability shall be tried prior to requiring the defendants to disclose and be discovered on the issue of damages. 2) The court has considered the effect of disclosure on promoting settlement between the parties. The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. 3) The plaintiffs have developed relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain this confidence and the defendants could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that trust. 4) The Court granted the defendants an order to strike portions of the plaintiffs’ claim."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff on April 14, 2005 for land described as: Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall, SK. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the court any offers received. HELD: The application for a judicial sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. On renewed application to confirm judicial sale there would be a stronger case for a sale of the property as the amount owing under the mortgage was described as being $29,994.98 and arrears of interest at $995.03 or total of $30,990.01. Counsel invites the court to apply Rule 5(1) with respect to the irregularities identified. An application for leave to commence an action was premature and the applicant's position is that this is overvalued and would likely sell in the $30k to $45,000 range, based on a real estate agent's knowledge of property being sold in the area. An appointment for the hearing was set for April 21, 2008 and leave was granted for the plaintiff to commence action. Statement of claim was not noted for default prior to the application being made. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer but does not appear to have done so."
9_2009nssc420.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance. The admissibility of the accused's videotaped statement was at issue with regard to his capacity to understand the Charter caution given by the police. When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008 related to alcohol and weapon possession. The accused was given his Charter rights. He was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement to the police. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty to make it impossible for the police to make a clarification such as, ""Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement."" HELD: The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial. The Court did not believe he was focussed on the present and his immediate right to retain and instruct counsel and that he was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day. The police would have been aware that the accused's forgetfulness of when the assaults occurred is his attempt to avoid responsibility for the separate retaliation of Mr. Godron. It would be egregious to allow admission of the videotaped statement into evidence."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. 1)The mens rea required for s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code, is objective foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that there be an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim. 2)The evidence fell short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 3)The Crown had not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 of the Code."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction pursuant to S. 813 of the Code. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. 1) The facts are unremarkable. It's tortured progress through the Canadian criminal justice system makes it much more remarkable than the facts. The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilyzer readings simply could not have been obtained by the consumption of one or two beer while stopped at the roadside in the manner the appellant described. 2) The accused rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 3) The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings.  4) The trial judge found that the appellant rebutting the presumption that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care or control of the vehicle. He adopted (at para. 20) Green P.C.J.’s reasoning, which included finding that the accused was planning on resting and sleeping for a number of hours before driving to Manitoba, and did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting his vehicle in motion.  5) The court reviewed the evidence at the third trial and found that, at the point the officer found the appellant, there was a risk of him putting his vehicle into motion, which was met by the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This would not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and, where the results of the analyses were different, created the risk the accused would be in the position to commit an arbitrary detention contrary to the s. of the Charter."

a_1993canlii6596.txt,"Appeal from 107 SaskR 135, 44 RFL(3d)185. Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property. The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","The issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant appeals from a judgment for damages pronounced in Queen's Bench. Following a jury trial for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, judgment was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. Since liability was admitted by the defendant, the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in law in admitting the evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence which resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. HELD: 1) The award for loss of income is admissible provided that the expert is qualified and his or her testimony is necessary or useful to assist the court in the determination of technical or scientific matters. 2) There is no clear medical evidence that the plaintiff has diminished ability to earn income in the future, or that she is totally disabled to be inadmissible, as the need of the jury for assistance in that area has not been demonstrated. 3) The trial judge's decision to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings is highly optimistic, given her post injury work record and the opinion of Margaret Friesen that, in many ways, she is presently working beyond her physical capabilities. 4) The court rejected the appellant's contention that the admission of the tabulation and explanation of it by the appellant resulted in an 88% deduction for contingencies."

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that reserve on the matter of costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel for the parties although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the position taken before Wimmer J. (who directed the issue to trial) was that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance for Jade based on the needs-based approach and that the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs is dismissed.  1) The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet Jade's anticipated needs. This argument cannot be accepted. 2) The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 184C of The Queen's Bench Rules allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the other rules in Part 14A of The Rules in assessing appropriate costs. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of a judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the number of interim applications are partially attributable to the applicant who continued to make exaggerated claim for the whole of the testator's estate well past the time when it was appropriate. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.

Nor would she have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived. 2)As there was no surviving spouse the children were not entitled to any benefits payable under the Act.  3)SGI paid to the Public Trustee for the sum of $47,427 being the minimum death benefit pursuant to s146(3). Since the money paid by SGI was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances of this case, took the place of the surviving spouse, the death benefit became fixed at $47.427 and the formula used in s146 was $94,854.

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants applied for judicial review of a decision of one of the respondents, The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Licensing Commission. The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a horse race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses.

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.",HELD: The Court found that the children were in need of protective services and that the mother was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining them. The Court also found that there was a risk to the children if the mother were no longer living in the home. The children were placed in temporary care with the mother and there was consideration given to moving the supervised access visits out of the Agency Office and into a more comfortable location in the Respondents home.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application.

Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.

The appellant is a non-earner as defined by the Act who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on July 25, 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. Counsel for SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the respondent's gross yearly employment income (IRB) sets the claimant's earning reality at less than half the time. HELD: 1) The Income Replacement Benefit must reflect a claimant's earned reality. The earning reality was working for employment income no more than half of the time and the GYEI from which the IRB is derived. 2) The Court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first 180 days. The legislative intent remains the same. The Income replacement benefit must reflect the claimant’s earning reality.  3) The applicant was working full-time for the past six weeks and never worked close to 60 hours per week. The average work week was 34.25 hours. 4) The respondent was a subcontractor for a logging and milling business in Meadow Lake area of Saskatchewan. The applicant had previously worked for CLC Logging Ltd. and earned $16,673 for the accident, and received his full entitlement to employment insurance until it expired on October 24, 1998. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant to this case. The provisions of s. 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB. The rate of increase in the period of employment is based solely on the time that the applicant would have actually been employed during the time of the accident. The adjusted IRB for the 181st and subsequent days is $10,870. 5) The application of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, c. A-35, Reg are as follows: 117(1) Subject to s. 116 of the act, the Act provides for calculation of IRB based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. The Act requires that an applicant be able to hold the employment he or she could have held during the 180 days, and the rate of reduction for inclement weather is not less than the rate at which the applicant was receiving employment insurance benefits. 6) The"
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","HELD: The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order would be issued and that primary care would remain with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. The court considered the objectives of spousal support set forth in s15.2(6) of the Divorce Act. It found that the parties had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and that the couple considered this property to be a business operated for the benefit of the family. The Court considered the position of both parties on value and the reasonableness of the expense, having regard to the means of the spouses, and those of the child, and to the family's spending pattern prior to the separation."

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an  ATV. HELD: The accused was convicted of driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2). The offence was clearly prohibited under the Motor Vehicle Act and the accused was not guilty of this offence. The use of the ATV on public highways is clearly prohibited. The words “motor Vehicle” in the Act include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain a license to drive it in the highway by section 11.

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. HELD: Appeal allowed. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met. The court found that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father and that there would be no order for retroactive maintenance. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted, does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the matter. The Court found that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay child support unless the situation was extremely grave. However, in light of the case law, the evidence does not demonstrate that the daughter unilaterally withdrew from her father."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. However, the defendants' defence of qualified privilege is accepted. 1) The plaintiff was not only defamed but was also defamed by the wording of the plaintiff’s grievance. 2) There was no basis for jurisdictional defence. 3) The court found that the plaintiff had proven his defamedness. The court accepted the defendants’ defence that the words in the grievance referred to him as an active participant in the harassment and that they were communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff."

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a declaration. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. 2) The application to bar is yet another Salvo in the bitter custody/access dispute. The respondent has instructed me to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the court, it happens too often and for no good reason."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. Although that trial originally was set for a three week jury trial, in all likelihood the trial will not take that long as Mr. Ottertail re-elected to be tried by Queen’s Bench judge alone on April 18, 2013. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Although this Court certainly has inherent jurisdiction to govern its own process within its own court within the province of Saskatchewan it has no jurisdiction to make any orders involving facilities and personnel in the Province of Ontario. It is being suggested that the victim services branch in Ontario would be responsible for ensuring that whatever order the Court may make is complied with including the exclusion of cameras and recording devices. 2)The court was very concerned about the possible ramifications of granting an order allowing video conferencing for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province. The administration of justice in Ontario was also concerned. 3)The Court was very disappointed and disappointed in the decision to dismiss the application. It was not prepared to accept the argument that the courtroom in Toronto where only Bert Haverkort's family would be in attendance is just an extension of that courtroom in Saskatchewan and it is a distinct courtroom in another province over which this Court has no control or control. 4)Although the Court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order enabling video conferncing for a specific nonparticipating person within a province, this Court is very concerned that this precedent could be set throughout the world.

b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1)When dealing with a request to vary, the respondent must accept the original order was correct at the time it was made and allow the payor to escape his obligations if enough time elapses. 2)The respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 3)In approaching variation, the applicant is able to establish he has been working at full time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned actual income from full-time position. The reason why income had to be imputed is that the respondent has failed in his onus here for the years 2005 through to, and including, 2012.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

It is the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister'), pursuant to s. 33(7)(d) of the Education Act, is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. HELD: 1)Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation then the cost of such a lease is the responsibility of the Province. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be for supplying the building free of costs. It would not include those expenses associated with operating the building. Absent the Minister's approval, the board could enter into any lease for the rental of buildings for school purposes, pursuant to the property service component of the general funding formula. There is no obligation on the Province to fund the leasing costs. 2)If the Minister decides to meet a request by a board, by providing school building leased from third parties rather than constructing or purchasing school buildings, the Province is not required, at least at this time, to pay the costs. The payment of leasing expenses by the province is not unprecedented. From 1978 to 1982, the North Side-Victoria Amalgamated School Board leased parish schools. In 1983, it entered into various leasing arrangements for the buildings. The buildings represented a long term asset for the general populous and approved the use of capital funds on these buildings.

The plaintiff sought a default judgment on the basis that there was no notice of intention to proceed filed prior to entering the default order. HELD: The default judgment was set aside. There was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. 1)Civil Procedure Rule 3.04 is permissive, that is, the court could order otherwise, find the position of the defendant did not meet the test for the Court to strike under the provisions of the Rule. 2)The prothonotary was not estopped nor had there been waiver. Neither discontinuance nor an application to dismiss for want of prosecution is a step in proceeding. The failure to file the notice of intent to proceed is not mere technicality. 3)The applicant failed to provide the necessary facts on which a decision can be made as to whether or not the defendant intended to file a defence. 4)The default judgment should be set aside based on Civil Procedure rule 3.06. Civil Procedure Rules 3.03 do not require the notice to be in writing or in any particular form, although the Nova Scotia practise is a formal document. The Court should exercise its discretion and not deprive the plaintiff of its right to defend as a result of any default by the insurer."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant sought leave to appeal from a sentence of 5 months incarceration to be followed by 18 months' probation, imposed by a Provincial Court judge, after he pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s334 of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Court found that the information on the appellant's situation since sentencing was not reliably and properly before the court. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time made. 2)The sentence imposed was not fit. 3)Given the age of the appellant and the absence of any significant past criminal record, it is not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed from his present positive environment and placed in custody."
c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. HELD: The Court found that an appropriate and proper period of notice was 8 months and that the plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment with the defendant plus vacation pay at six percent per annum. The Court also found that the defendant put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her and it was one that she obviously could not accept."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not comply with the required time frame. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 28(2)(b). The defendant offered a different requirement for the exercise of the right to first refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. The offer did not require that it be forwarded a letter of commitment directly from a recognized financial institution. It simply required that the plaintiffs 'provide' such a letter."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This is an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files of Magnes v. Magnes and D.A.L. and whether the firm may remain as counsel for the plaintiffs in those proceedings. HELD: The screen is sufficient in the circumstances of this case and there is not a risk of real mischief in this case. While Hunter Miller's concerns are legitimate and should be taken seriously, on behalf of their clients, the Olive Waller firm has put in place many of the screening measures suggested by the Guidelines in the Code. The screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation occurred prior to the arrival of the applicant. The instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried with them the implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta. Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court. She was to file an affidavit of bona fides as to the sale which should relieve her of the obligation for payment of the loan.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial.","The applicant asserts that the respondent's father's company (the third party) paid $55,000 to the third party in contravention of the order of the court directing funds to be paid into court and freezing any money that was not already paid into the court. HELD: The children were to remain with the applicant. Pursuant to an interim possession and exclusive use order, the primary residence was with the respondent. The status quo as to access should also be maintained. The applicant returned the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of exercise of access by the respondent in accordance with existing orders. The court ordered access to the respondent for that purpose, provided, on such occasion, the respondent will pick up and return the children. 1)The applicant was directed to remove the children from Medicine hat and to move to Medicine Hat. 2)The court ordered the respondent to pay $800 per month in rent and $10,000 in sales tax. 3)The Court directed the applicant to sell all of her property in Medicine Hat and to make an interim inventory of all of the properties. 4)The status quo of access should be maintained as the respondent was granted additional access to include Thursday or Monday, when the weekend falls on a statutory holiday and the applicant was prohibited from removing children from Saskatchewan without court order, absent consent. 5)The application for leave to move was denied.

c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused gave evidence at his own trial about his encounters with the RCMP which caused him to be fearful of them. He testified that he had filed numerous complaints against the members of the RCMP and these were being investigated. He alleged that he was seriously assaulted and injured during one of those encounters at his home. He also claimed to have been harassed and assaulted during another encounter. HELD: The appeal against both conviction and sentence was dismissed.  1)The Court read the notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the trial proceedings and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. We are all fully familiar with what happened. 2)The court found that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against the accused and was unnecessary to establish your state of mind which was adequately established."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The appellant was unsuccessful in his application to have his suspension and probation as medical resident rescinded and to prohibit the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action. An appeal committee was struck pursuant to the provisions of the College of Medicine, Regulations for Dealing with Unsatisfactory Evaluations and Disciplinary Action Part. He appealed the resulting order from the Queen's Bench Chambers judge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)There is no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs being writs of grace and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention (see Rimmer v. Adshead). 2)The appellant must demonstrate he abused his discretion. No error of principal, nor any misapprehension of or disregard for any material fact has been demonstrated."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties cohabited for some 2½ years and then divorced in 2000. After seven years and three children, they separated in 2001. The petitioner carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the major part of the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. Over the years, the respondent continued to live on the farm. An appraisal of it and the out buildings was done and the report filed. In the circumstances, the family property should be divided equally. HELD: 1) There was a claim for $16,500 which was said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. The father owned the tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. 2) The petitioner received no income from the farm since the separation. 3) The farm machinery was exempt. 4) The respondent sold his trailer and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the farm equipment. 5) An RRSP registered in the name of the respondent was added to the balance sheet resulting in a total of $33,257.31. 6) There were several debts and expenses which the respondent submitted should be taken into account. 7) The tractor was owned by the father prior to the marriage. Although it was acquired prior to marriage, the interest earned would not be exempt, but have no evidence as to what that has been. In other words, the father owned a line of machinery of significant value that was subject to a distribution. In this case, the farm machinery constituted family property.  8) The farmer owned a Case 800 tractor. He sold his tractor and the proceeds of $12,000 were used for purchase of the acreage. He now claims an exemption in that amount. 9) A claim in respect to monies allegedly owing the father to the Morris rod weeder. Both are statute barred and the father is not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it. 10) Over a period of time the respondent has owned several vehicles which he sold and then purchased other vehicles, including trucks. He has received no benefit from these expenses. Therefore, he should bear no responsibility for the payments made and I decline to take them into consideration. 11) There is a debt of $1,200 which is claimed by the respondent to be owed to him for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance.  12) There are additional debts as follows which the petitioner has been looking after."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. Following the decision of the Board which concluded a contract with an increase which the employer says would increase the wage costs by 31 percent, the employer refused to sign a contract or implement it and sought clarification of the retroactivity of the wage rates. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. 2)The court did not find that the errors made here were so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts. 3)The employer was not aware that the 45 day limit was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions and arguments and the decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification of an action under The Class Actions Act (CAA) on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who, as defined by the Indian Act, was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either in World War I, World War II or the Korean War and/or their dependants who received some or all of the veteran benefits. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute-barred. 1) There were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that were individual to the class members. 2) There was no suggestion that Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits. The issue at the certification stage is whether the plaintiffs are statute barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. The fact that the Crown argues that if any claim by the plaintiffs existed, it cannot be brought 30-60 years after the claimed entitlement to benefits arose and have been so for decades."
c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The Court granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work and a 12 month conditional sentence was substituted in place of the conditional discharge. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Provincial Court judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The sentence imposed did not reflect the gravity of the offence. The conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in the same situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity. It involved a total of $24,000.00 lost by CIBC Visa. 2)The sentence imposed was not appropriate for the circumstances. The accused had no criminal record and pre-sentence report suggested that he was low risk to re-offend. This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the judge called 'a rather intricate kiting system'. 3)The accused was 28 years old at the time of sentencing. He was married and had two young children. At sentencing, his debt load was $402,000 and there were some 37 different creditors interested in his affairs. He deposited the cheque into his bank account and the next day withdrew $11,000 in cash. About five days later, he repeated the same process, this time depositing and withdrawing $13,000, depositing $13k in cash and depositing another $13000. This time, he withdrew the $20,000 cash and withdrew $21,000 from CIBC's Visa account. CIBC issued a restitution order in the amount of $25,000 to the accused and the accused was sentenced to 12 months conditional discharge, 1 year, usual terms and conditions, plus 200 hours community service. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s742.3(1) and further condition that the accused perform 200 hours in community service with credit to be given in that regard for any such work performed to date pursuant to the probation order made by the sentencing judge."

The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). An initial question was whether the trial judge's decision quoted above reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the judge concluded that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and the odour of alcohol were matters which, if accepted by properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The trial judge did not commit an error in law."

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old.

This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts.

The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","Pricewaterhouse retained Allan Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors of Alternative Sports Limited pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and when he attended at the premises he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. HELD: The defendant was granted summary judgment.  1)The evidence advanced by County Realty was overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist. The mere statement by the defendant, that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issue exists which ought to be tried. 2)The defendant was entitled to summary judgment including a declaration with respect to the inventory and the existing order shall continue with damages to be determined and assessed in due course."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant GMCL moves for an order for summary judgment on evidence to dismiss the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody, alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred on October 25, 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. The two plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in the vehicle were in it. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The parties are encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs failing which they are invited to file written submissions within 30 days of the date of release of this decision. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court's process."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was stopped by an RCMP officer shortly after driving away from a bar/restaurant. The accused blew a test on the approved screening device and was taken to Carlyle where samples of breath were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel. 1)The accused had initiated a procedure for obtaining legal advice which clearly could not be pursued once his cell phone was taken away. However, it is clear from the evidence that the accused made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. 2)The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused’s right to an answer and defence."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure that the health and safety of every person employed by it was protected by failing to instruct the employee on how to unplug a receiving pit from a moving fan blade. The employee died shortly after entering the receiving pit. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the employee suffered a serious injury at work is evidence that the Crown has accurately related what occurred and was proven. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all six counts. 1) The evidence of the employee's injury or death was not accepted. 2) Given the Court of Appeal's approval of these remarks, I do not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or a worker death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to provide safety to an employee. 3) Viterra is not charged with only the general allegation that it failed to ensure the health of Mr. Cruse. Rather, counts and allege the manner in which the employee was made aware of the hazards would have been buried in the mass of other material. The accused is found to have failed to exercise due care and diligence to avoid the contravention of s. 148(1)."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The trial judge found that the accused intentionally drove in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove a manner intended to scare the complainant. She was entitled to conclude from the appellant's intentional action that his conduct was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver and not a momentary lapse. HELD: The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error on the de minimis issue. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach in rendering her decision. 2)The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the Court's decision. The appellant conceded that all elements of an assault offence under s. 266 of the Criminal Code had been made out by the Crown. The Court reviewed the evidence and saw nothing in it which suggested that the judge's decision was an error. 3)The Court was not entitled to re-weigh the evidence or substitute my own opinion for that of the Court."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","A divorce and matrimonial property hearing was held. The wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so as to increase the maintenance provision and at the same time retain the asset division in her favor. The Husband and Wife covenant and agree that the wife will be solely responsible for repayment of the overdraft and loan at the CIBC in Lower Sackville and the estimated balance on the mortgage as of the date of separation was $28,257.01.

d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal","At issue in this case was whether a police officer may overturn a decision made against her by the Police Review Board for the reason that the Regulation number by which she was charged did not precisely correspond to the one she was found guilty of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The failure to refer to what the Review Board considered the 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only, and in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the proceedings. There was no denial of natural justice if the direction in the footnote to Form 12 was interpreted as a legislative provision limiting the tribunal's powers. 2)There was nothing which would suggest that the Board's decision was patently unreasonable. It was clear from the cross-examination of witnesses by counsel for the applicant and the direct examination of the applicant that the focus of the evidence was whether she had permission from Chief Trider to be present at the meeting when in fact she did not have permission. 3)No unfairness was occasioned when the Board found that the elements of lying or misleading fell within the default particularized by Regulation 5(1)(d) rather than 5(2)(g)(iii) as typed on the notice form. The Board was free to substitute what it felt to be the ""proper"" section number and conclude, in the circumstances, that Constable White was guilty of the disciplinary default referred to in s.7 of the Police Act. 4)It is clear from review of all of the forms completed, including Form 12, that the allegations made against the complainant included the allegation that she had lied to the complainants during the course of the investigation. The fact that the complainant was a parent of one of the victims does not change the fact that she lied about the meeting. 5)There is nothing which persuades the Board that the decision is patently reasonable. It may 'be sufficiently' drawn to the attention of the member by describing the alleged misconduct; or rather the behaviour described in the content of the notice; but there is also an express requirement that the designation of the class of penalty must be contained in the notice. In this case, it is obvious from the nature of the allegations against her that she made an error in interpreting the provisions conferring jurisdiction on it, or has committed an infraction of a disciplinary default which confers (or limits) its jurisdiction."

The Crown opposed the application for bail pending appeal. The appellant had been convicted of both counts. He abided by the terms of the pre-trial release and had strong economic and family ties to his community.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the contract was in error and sought rectification. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. 1)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and there was no agreement reached by the parties to pay interest. 2)There was no clear and compelling evidence that the defendants knew or ought to have known that an RTM does not come with basement. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish that there was a common agreement or intention and mistake in recording that the price of the basement was included in the agreement.  4)The defendant's evidence that he provided a price to the plaintiff in June 1992 was inconsistent with the answers given by him at the cross-examination for discovery. It was also not consistent with his own notation of June 6, which indicated the defendants wanted a price for the basement."
d_1997canlii11230.txt,"The contract for the construction of a spur rail line to the grain terminal provided that either party could refer any contract dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator's award favoured the A &amp; E Rail Contractor's position. Leave to appeal had been granted. At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied. Failing agreement between the parties, the appellant would pay the respondent's taxed costs on the appeal on a party and party basis.","The respondent applied for leave to appeal an arbitration award respecting a contract dispute between it and Rail Contractors. The contract provided that either party can refer any dispute respecting their contractual obligations to arbitration. The dispute arose between the parties respecting the performance of the contract and both parties agreed to resolution of the dispute by arbitration. They each retained legal counsel, agreed on an arbitrator, and defined the issues to be resolved. The arbitrator heard two days of viva voce evidence, admitted several documents as exhibits, received written legal briefs from counsel, and subsequently rendered a written decision that dealt with all the issues before him. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award confirmed. 1)The findings of the arbitrator with which the appellant takes issue do not involve questions of law but rather involve 'questions of fact'. The appellant's submission refers extensively to the evidence presented. It constitutes in effect an invitation to the court to retry the case that was heard and determined. 2)The scope of review of appeal is limited to question of law.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under The Dependents' Relief Act (DRI) varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the DRI, however they did put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of support. HELD: The maintenance was to be paid monthly until the children reached the age of twenty-one years of age. The amount to be awarded for maintenance was not tied to the standard of living the children experienced during the testator's lifetime, or to the net income the estate would generate subsequently. The term 'personal effects' does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm. 1)There was nothing within the will, read as a whole,with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term ""personal effects"" to be given anything other than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. 2)Personal effects did not have a connection with the deceased. 3)The DRI did not constrain the use of the term personal effects in s.9(1) of the Dependent's Relief Act.  4)The father's estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses."

It was important that he be reintroduced to his 10 year old daughter in a gradual and consistent fashion. He was granted access intitially for three and four hours in both provinces, then two days at the father's parent's home including overnight access and two days in the summer in British Columbia.

It is expected that Denby will be travelling to Saskatchewan before June and accordingly David should be given an opportunity to see his daughter during that time period. 2)In my opinion, David Wolbaum's generous and far-reaching requests are not reasonable at this time given his lengthy record for non-visiting his daughter.

The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The purpose of the Youth Court is the same as that of s. 107(1)(b) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. However, the courts in other cases have reached the same bottom-line conclusion as have. 2) The Youth Court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision. The court concluded that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had already expired."

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT.

d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","At the time of the motor vehicle accident, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The defendant's motor vehicle was stopped at a red light. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant's police vehicle was not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light. At the intersection, the defendant was operating a police vehicle and the plaintiff's headlights were in operation. The defendants claim the headlights of the defendant’s vehicle were not inoperable when it was approached by traffic control lights. HELD: 1) When the plaintiffs moved for finding the that the that witness was not qualified to express opinions on the operation or non-operation of the police vehicle, the destruction prevented the plaintiffs from examining the headlights. There was not presented evidence which established the officer was capable of expressing the opinion he gave in his testimony. When I consider the evidence of the lay witnesses and the police officer, if it had been admissible, the test of expertness so far as the law of evidence is concerned is still in the field in which it is sought to have the witness’ opinion. It is not sufficient to submit that he has had experience in various subjects of collision analysis because lamp examination is quite distinct from the other subjects referred to in the curriculum vitae. The explanation given by the officer is difficult to understand. The officer was an officer in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and he was operating the vehicle. He had preformed minimal study on lamp examination and he had no experience in the area. He was asked if he remembered the collision of vehicles. He testified that he did not see the accident but that he remembered looking in the rearview mirror and seeing the lights shining on the defendant vehicle. The officers testified that they were in the intersection when the accident occurred and that he was not aware there was to be a trial in this matter. 2) The officer testified that there was a lapse of time between one half hour and forty-five minutes before she proceeded towards the Hawes vehicle and when she did not pass he returned to the accident scene. There is no dispute the officer turned left in front of the plaintiff vehicle."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","This was an application for an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Charter) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The application alleged that the applicant, an accountant, filed fraudulent T4s and created false T4 sales in order to obtain a tax refund. The applicant sought an ancillary relief of declaration that his rights under ss. and Charter were infringed. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant was not satisfied that he would have pursued a warrant without the disclosure of information that he now knew to be erroneous. 2)The information contained in the information did not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll. 3)The evidence did not support a reasonable apprehension of bias.  4)The respondent was more comfortable omitting information which he now knows was erroneous. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, it was satisfied that the officer's own evidence supports the inference that the learned justice of the peace ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue the search warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant."
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence. The Court found that the accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. There was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or becoming a danger to the public."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. The Ministry requested a 6 month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.  1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. 2) The father was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both the mother and the father were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The father has a substantial criminal record which was tendered as Exhibit P-3. This includes 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property crimes, especially vehicles, and failures to comply with the dispositions made with regard to his offences. He proposes that he will continue living with the mother while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to test of their premises for contamination). The motion was dismissed. The court found that the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act created a concern about the suspension of time limitations for actions that had already been certified. The Court dismissed the application. Based on the plain wording of the judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit, the application for examination dismissed. It was not necessary for the court to get into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. The order was permanent and no further review was fixed. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The respondent had not engaged in gainful employment during the year following the judgment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the one year spousals maintenance order had expired and only few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousa support. 2) There was no evidence that the respondent was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence did not establish that she had made no effort at all to obtain employment within the year allocated by the Ottenbreit order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application."

The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application.

The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence.

d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown's appeal from the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the appellant to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years, is allowed.

He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after four months credit for time served on remand) and he received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally. 1) The narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1) rendered by the judge's interpretation of it is such that there is no need to change the wording of the statute. 2) The Court of Appeal clearly intended to make the broad application of the narrow application in s.485.012 of the Code to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused was found guilty of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking with intent to sell cocaine. He appeals his conviction only. HELD: The Court found that the trial judge erred in failing to grant an adjournment of the trial to allow a review of recently disclosed and discovered documents. The Court ordered a new trial. 1) The Court reviewed the documents and found that there were 27 additional documents not previously disclosed in the combined forces database that would trigger a disclosure obligation. 2) The court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to miscarriage of justice. 3) There was insufficient evidence to establish a breach of s. s. 4 of the Charter."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order. The appellant’s application to stay the execution of the interim order is allowed. That stay is to minimize prejudice pending the appeal and to balance the competing interests of the respondent who has been successful against those of an appellant who ought not to be prejudiced simply by appealing. HELD: Costs with respect to this application shall be left to the panel hearing the appeal.  1)The appellant is paying ongoing support (spousal and child) of $12,726 per month and Ms. Rees, by her own admission, has taken $25,000 from the line of credit after the separation. Even though the appellant was living in the family home, there was evidence, which the Chambers judge accepted, that Mr. Lawson was making significant payments with regard to that home to cover the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities ($4,476 per month). 2)If the order is enforced, the appellant may be disadvantaged. This is so because her means are very limited and thus there is a real possibility she would not be able to repay any 'overpayment' of support."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4.1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit. HELD: The Court found that the accused had in his possession child pornography between the 29th and 16th days of September, 2014 and the 16th day of October, 2014, at or near Fond-du-Lac, Saskatchewan. 1)The accused had access to child pornography when he was not on duty. 2)The Court found the accused guilty of accessing child pornography while he was on shift. 3)The evidence did not support the Crown’s conclusion that he and only he could have logged into the encrypted computer, connected to the internet, and found vile child abuse videos, downloaded them on to his computer."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","The plaintiff entered into an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for the defendant's fleet of trucks and associated equipment. When required, it would also provide shop supplies and parts to effect those services. During the relationship, the defendant paid the plaintiff's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay them as they became due. Eventually the defendant demanded payment of its outstanding invoice and offered a much smaller sum of money in satisfaction of accounts. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid equates to $10,902.32. The plaintiff argued that there was no express term in the contract and that in the absence of an implied term in which the parties agreed to charge a fair price for goods or services, the court was unable to determine how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred. The court awarded the defendant costs in the amount of $1,550.85."

e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","This appeal concerns the interpretation of s. 4 of the standard form lease, N.S. Regulation 270/87 made pursuant to s. 26 of the Residential Tenancies Act and certain sections of the Rent Review Act. The facts are that the tenants entered into a year to year lease in 1989. The lease was automatically renewable at the expiration of the term unless either the landlord or tenant had provided at least three months notice to terminate prior to the anniversary date of the lease. Despite the specific provision with respect to rent payable in the lease, the rent was raised from $500 per month to $515 per month effective May 1, 1989. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents."

The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.

The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

The court imposed a fine of $10,000 on the respondent for failing to comply with the order. The respondent was to provide a copy of the lease to the appellant within fifteen days of the order's execution or any alternation in the lease or tenants to it. The fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution but was to be payable forthwith. With respect to entering into the property ensuring compliance by inspection, this is unfortunately necessary given the history of the matter, the fact that the property was rented out to separate groups of students and the parties reached a Consent Order which was issued January the 9th, 2001.

Given the history and difficulties with this property, the Court found no reason why the respondent should not be required to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he should provide HRM within fifteen day of such change the particulars of the new and remaining tenants. 2) The Court found that there was no reason for the respondent to refuse to provide the respondent with copies of any written leases now or in the future. It found that he clearly intended to circumvent the By-Law and intended to disobey the Order. He did not occupy the building and apparently resides in Blockhouse. 3) The court considered random inspections that could be every week as an excessive imposition. It considered the requested amount of fine in the range of $25,000 to be excessive."

The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The Court found that the City and CUPE discriminated against the applicant on the basis of his disability. The applicant was awarded a 4% less wage than other comparable City employees and was compensated in the amount of $8,902. The court also found that there was no right of appeal on any matter unless provided for by the relevant legislature."

Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate.

In his amended application, he seeks a termination of spousal support or alternatively a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. HELD: 1) The respondent was entitled and continues to be entitled by virtue of her continuing inability to become self-sufficient. The court cannot conclude that his obligation to her should extend beyond the length of their marriage. The respondent has converted her equalized property into income. 2) There has been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act before variation can be considered. The applicant's income is now primarily derived from his pension. 3) There will be an order for maintenance of $300 per month effective the 1st of September and payable until August 31, 2008. 4) The court found that the respondent was economically disadvantaged by the breakdown of the marriage. She still had a relatively young child and there was nothing to suggest that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support. 5) There was no evidence that the applicant's obligation to the respondent extended beyond the time he was required to leave the military. The Court found that even where entitlement is based on 'non-compensatory grounds', the payor's pension income stream that has been divided, and ability to pay on the part of the other, is not an automatic ground for indefinite support."

There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.

The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","HELD: The court found that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income was three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The court also found that if the respondent had overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month."

The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses.

(Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge had the necessary evidence to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant for $3,604.13, which they alleged represented the losses incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the frustration of the contract. The plaintiff brought a counterclaim against the defendant Pacific Home Products Ltd. for $2,200. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiffs wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home. The contract was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. Both parties agreed to the ten foot diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation support for the glass sunrooms. After the land purchase contract was entered into, the plaintiff purchased land from the defendant and constructed a concrete foundation for the proposed sunroom. The court found that the contract was not reasonably forseeable by either party and that the plaintiff would be able to write off the loss over the course of time. HELD: 1) A just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to frustration be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio.  2) The contract as a whole was totally different from what the parties had intended. 3) The plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and Dennis Ens and Anne Ens 35% of loss. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. 4) Based on the facts as I find them, and the applicable law, I find the contract to be frustrated.  5) There was not sufficient evidence to show that the amount of $96.13 owing to the plaintiff to the defendant in the counterclaim for a balance, they believe owing to them, of $3.604."

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(2) and with driving while impaired by blood alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. HELD: The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. The grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and the evidence thus obtained should be excluded from the Certificate of Analysis. 1)The Court found that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused painted a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by impaired driving. The absence of the smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol did not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. 2)There was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court held that the Court could not have concluded that the officer's reasonable grounds for arresting the accused for impaired driving were objectively reasonable. 3)The admission of the evidence in the face of a breach so created would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the accused's rights."
e_2012skqb498.txt,"The defendant applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 169 for leave to amend his Statement of Defence. This is a defamation action and the amendment would add that the words spoken by the defendant were true and that the alleged defamation was justified in law. The action relates to statements made about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an X-ray and his failure to pass certain certification exams and that health officials knew that he should not be performing the work he was doing. There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings.

He alleged that the plaintiff has failed certification exams and that health officials knew the plaintiff should not be doing the work he was doing. The College Action is also a defamation action.

It does not speak to the discretion of the trial judge to determine how the two actions should proceed. 2)There were common issues of fact between the actions at issue. There were common allegations of competence and the position taken by “health officials.” 3)The statements made specific allegations about the plaintiff's failure to properly read an x-ray, and also alleged that Health officials knew he was failing certification exams. 4)The College Action was also a defamatory action.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school for two years. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend the school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children commenced this action against the defendant and then applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children. The family applied to strike out the statement of claim. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interim injunction was dismissed with written reasons. The court found that the CÉF did not seem to have understood the mandate of the school and that it was in the best interests of the children to attend a French school in Saskatchewan."

The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act, SS 2001, C-12.01 on October 8, 2013. This claim was subsequently amended and will refer to the amended paragraph numbers. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaw Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws). The claim concerns the misleading and deceptive advertising of 'Low Sodium' beverages by Loblaws and seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' “Low Sodium” beverages but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants have gone to great length to try and confuse the issue, the issue is simple. It is misleading to label identical products differently. There will be no genuine issue requiring trial when the judge is able to reach a fair and just determination on the merits of this application."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed. HELD: 1) The information put forward here is much more specific than the request itself and it is not fair. It cannot be presumed that the client could effectively gather together the information on all of the matters he provided legal services in relation to so as to order the assessment that they request. 2) There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of the legal services during the time they worked with the applicant as their legal counsel. 3) It is not in the interests of justice to extend the time beyond the 30 day time period for the assessment of the accounts."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month.  1) The Court reviewed the respondent’s financial statement and personal tax returns for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 and found that he had a better chance of obtaining a residency in Canada if he was permitted to return to the country. 2) The court found that the petitioner had obtained an interest-free loan from the Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region (RQHR), with a three-year term, and recalled these funds were received by way of cheque and subsequently deposited into their joint Toronto-Dominion [TD] account. 3) The petitioner was awarded interim child/spousal support for the first three weekends of each month. He was given access on the first two weekends of every month, save for one week each week. 4) The respondent was granted access on three weekends and one Wednesday."
