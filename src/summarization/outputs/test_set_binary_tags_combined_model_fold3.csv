d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two girls were living with their mother. He denied assaulting the complainants, and sentenced him to 9 months imprisonment for the assault on B.J.R., followed by 2 years probation and 1 month consecutive. He appealed his convictions. Allowing the appeal, that the Court could not find any error on the part of the trial judge in conducting the trial or in weighing the evidence. The Court carefully considered the evidence, and concluded that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and the appeal was dismissed."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1) There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial.  2) On the facts as found by trial judge, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code. 3) The Court had nothing before it upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. The Court explained to him that there are certain procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which they may act upon such allegations. These procedures were not followed and there was nothing before the Court upon which it might act."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","One of the defendants in the main proceeding moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threats and interfering with the workers conducting the harvest operation. The plaintiff argued the attachment order should be terminated because it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 49.01(1), and that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.  1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The witness did not say the contents were true. 2)Sterling Farm did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The affidavit could have been read as a form of affidavit or, in the alternative, as an ex parte motion to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor.  3)The affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant in relation to the alleged parcel changes and tax sale did not comply with the Rules 48.01 and 49.02. 4)The plaintiff failed to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions.  5)It was not satisfied that the plaintiff had established conduct on the part of the plaintiff that would hinder any attempt by the applicant to resume or expand its business. The mere allegation that the defendant was a party to the agreement (the plaintiff did not appear to have assets in Nova Scotia or any other place at the time of the signing of the document) or that it had a legitimate concern that it was being used to hinder or delay its creditors."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at 2:40 a.m. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. The document consists of preprinted form and is made up of pre-printed words and underlined blanks. There are total of alterations in preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks, resulting in a change in the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. The original printed phrase was 'That did receive each of the said samples directly into a Breathalyzer® model an approved instrument as defined in s254(1) of the Criminal Code' and the sectional diagram drawn through the lines and above same is a word that is not used in the certificate or by other evidence. HELD: The accused's charge was dismissed. The accused was found not guilty of driving with an alcohol level over the legal limit. 1)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved object is a matter of law. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that was not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. Probably not. The use of certificate is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial. If it is to be afforded to the Crown the use of a certificate is shortcut afforded to it. 2)There was insufficient evidence to adequately identify the accused with respect to the model of the approved instrument. There was no medical evidence that the accused blew the instrument into any of the three models designated for identification. 3)The accused's model did not adequately advance the fact that the instrument was designated for this purpose. The case law does not apply here. There is insufficient evidence at all to properly identify the instrument when the model is not properly designated and the only way to do so is by way of the make and model. The model did adequately describe the instrument in all its unusual and unusual circumstances and was not sufficiently described in the case report to be adequately identified. 4)The Court could not rely upon the model's expert opinion or the weight of the evidence if it was not adequately identified and therefore there was no evidence"
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income, whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim custody with specified access. The petitioner requested that the child support arrears be paid on an interim basis. Given the age and circumstances of the children and the fact that the petitioner had not seen the children for ten months, the Court was not prepared to adjust the amount of child support payable for the purposes of s. 8. The respondent shall continue to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the respondent's current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes. Retroactive support was warranted.  2) The petitioner's Line 150 income did not 'fairly reflect all the money available...' for child support purposes. A retroactive adjustment was ordered pursuant to s. 18 of the Children's Law Act to January 1, 2006. 3) The parties' verbal agreement for the petitioner to have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday was not changed. There was nothing in the evidence before the Court that rebutted that presumption."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed, giving his reasons for not giving consent in a timely manner. The Residential Tenancies Officer made no finding that the reasons were either arbitrary or unreasonable. The Court allowed the appeal and declared the tenancy had not been converted into a Month to Month. It held that the landlord had not erred in law in that he had not given notice that the lease would terminate and that he did not have the inclination or inclination to change."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary a child support order made in May 2002 because his income had decreased as a result of his being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing the lay-off was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage and that she had received $70 per month for riding lessons which never took place. She also sought to increase the husband's contribution for her son's hockey, golf and baseball expenses. HELD: 1) The husband was to pay child support of $54 per month pursuant to the May 2002 consent judgment. The father's obligation to contribute to the child's riding lessons was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 2) The wife's application to have the husband contribute for the children's extracurricular activities be dismissed was not supported by the evidence. 3) The Court found that the wife had not met the burden of proving a change in income that would constitute change in circumstance as the husband had not received employment insurance benefits in 1999 and 2000 and that saving money for school and paying off debt did not constitute an 'other cause' as contemplated by s. 14 of the Guidelines. If any of these circumstances were established, it would result in a variation of the support order. Should the wife follow through with her plan and actually commence post-secondary education she may requalify as a 'child of marriage' pursuant to s. 165 of the Queen's Bench Rules."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

The issues relate to 15 properties. 15 properties were decided on one appeal and the issues are the same for each property. The test in such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment. The door may still be opened but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure as it may relate to the general. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant."
b_1995canlii3936.txt,"The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property. A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. He was sentenced to a 5 month closed custody disposition concurrent to a 9 month open custody disposition previously imposed. Shortly after he started to serve his 9-month open custody sentence, he escaped custody and took a truck from the parking lot of a residence. A police officer tried to stop the truck they were driving when they accelerated and hit the side of an attached garage. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: The sentence was reduced to 5 months secure custody. 1 year secure custody was added to the sentence, with a 1 year secured custody option. 2)The accused was 18 when he turned 18. He had already been in breach of probation. 3)A five month secure custody disposition was not fit in R. v. Shane B. (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file no. 6372 and 6427) and R v.

HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. After being pulled back into the store by the clerk, an altercation occurred between the clerk and the appellant. In the course of the dispute the appellant, while on his knees, was struck several times with a baseball bat and ended up on the floor. The clerk sustained no physical injuries. The Crown concedes this was a 'technically robbery' offence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1)The Crown concedes the incident was technically robbery and is at the low end of the scale of seriousness. 2)In these circumstances it is appropriate to allow the sentence appeal and to reduce the sentence to 1 year incarceration with a 10 year section 100 order; 3)The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed.

c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","Both litigants sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal. The wife, who was a self-represented litigant in a divorce proceeding, brought an application to admit fresh evidence. Application dismissed; the evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both; the judge found no palpable or overriding error in the manner in which he attempted to reconcile the conflicting affidavits; the award of $20,000.00 to the respondent husband was based on the idea that the value of the assets held by the wife exceeded those retained by the husband; in fact, the amount owed to the husband by the sale of the Chicago property was approximately half way between the two claims; the court found that the judge committed no reversible error. The respondent husband's application to have the matrimonial property divided on appeal was dismissed because it did not meet the test for admission of fresh evidence at trial; and the application was dismissed without costs."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","In dealing with the first application, the petitioner sought to vary the child support order granted by the court in 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wished to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 1990 CanLII 6863 (SK QB), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.)Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the court to the 'wishes of the children' issue is to take into account all the circumstances, including the child's wish to change from father to mother. 2)There was no evidence to suggest that this was no longer in the children's best interests. As no material change was demonstrated, the application must be dismissed."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant company appealed a decision of the Small Claims Tribunal which found that the defendant had breached the contract but that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its damages when, on June 2, the defendant declined the opportunity to finish seeding the plaintiff land. The defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench arguing the trial decision was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with the plaintiff's cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. 2)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking the same question multiple times. The trial judge's findings of fact had been reasonable and he managed the trial fairly, patiently and efficiently. 3)Leave was granted to appeal under s.45 of The Small Claims Act. Significantly, the small claims court may appeal only on a question of law basis. The Company's language was innocuous, created no unfairness and revealed no bias."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike two affidavits it had prepared in response to a challenge to its authority to suspend and revoke the applicant's license. At issue was whether the affidavits were admissible on an application for certiorari and mandamus and whether they raised jurisdictional issues or were merely errors of law within the jurisdiction. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There must be a real dispute. The fact that there was an ongoing and clear dispute with respect to the authority the Board had delegated to the applicant Board and the authority of the Natural Products Marketing Council to hold a'show cause' hearing raised questions of jurisdiction. 2)The affidavits provided some historical background and background to the reasoning of the Board for its failure to attend the hearing before the Council and for their differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. 3)The affidavit evidence was admissible. There was no error in law by the Board. The applicant did not demonstrate an error of law on the face of the record. If the issue concerned jurisdiction, jurisdiction, or whether the application was a jurisdictional dispute, affidavits should not be excluded. Affidavits not only admissible but also admissable to complete the records."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for damages in the amount of $270,307.05 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract. Roper appealed, arguing that the judge erred in finding that the defendant was in breach of the contract and in holding that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in the contract. Allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, that both parties had breached the contract, Roper by failing to perform and Devco by not providing the approximate tonnages set out therein. The trial judge found that even if the defendant had performed the contract the plaintiff would have continued to operate at loss. As a result, the court held that Roper did not suffer any loss as a result of the breach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The plaintiff was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation under the heading 'Banking CPP', which prescribed termination on 30 days written notice and limited any damage claimed to 30 days from the date the contract was terminated. 2)The defendant was awarded nothing but the sum of $10,000 awarded to the plaintiff for the costs incurred by the defendant in obtaining the substituted performance contract and the refund of overpayments made for the coal from other sources. 3)There was no loss of profits arising as a direct result of defendant's termination. The court found that the plaintiff had not breached its contract and that the breach entitled it to terminate the contract without notice. 4)In the context of the defendant's operations and the intentions of the parties, the Court dismissed all of the plaintiff's damages."
c_2017skqb388.txt,HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The respondent is removed as an executor pursuant to the Grant of Probate ordered by Gabrielson J. in July 2016. This will give him an opportunity to bring his application back before the Court for determination. If he does not give notice by February 15, 2018, then, subject to a further order of this Court, this direction shall expire.  2) The Court has the jurisdiction to remove an executrator of an estate both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. See Ocean Man Trust, 1993 CanLII 6781 (CA); Figley Figley, 2012 SKCA 36 (CanLII), 393 Sask 44; and Sinclair Sinclair, 2013 SKQB 123 (CanlII), 427 Sask 36. It is clear that this is a case in which the Court should exercise its jurisdiction. It ordered the removal of the respondent from the estate and ordered that the three executors be removed as executors. The direction for the Kent and Rodney Argue to take no steps to distribute assets in the estate or to process the estate until after February 15 2018 is included in the concept of 'other special circumstances'. 3) The court found that it would be inappropriate for the executor to challenge the validity of the Will while at the same time remaining an executrix. The Court ordered the application be removed from the way in which it was prepared."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay is insufficient to deny Key its day in court. The application is granted. Costs shall follow the cause."

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 4(2) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act. At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that the warrantless search was invalid, and that the respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their occupation and possession of the property. He held that the search was unreasonable and that there was no breach of their s. 8 Charter rights. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of that offence, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date as alleged in the Information. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered.  1)There was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused. 2)The trial judge erred on the issue of when the offence was alleged to have been committed. The dates of the offences were not material. If the reason for the directed verdict was that it was too late to amend, that was also a reversible error."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the five-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years; the husband had worked long hours daily for 28 straight days during which he was confined to the oil rig and then had 28 days off. The wife was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. She sought to become self-sufficient. The respondent was to maintain life insurance and an education fund for the child.

2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to proceed with its action. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was responsible for an inordinate and legally inexcusable delay in pursuing its claim. 2) Mediation was concluded in February of 2000 and the defendant applied for an order pursuant to Rule 231 of the Queen's Bench Rules compelling the plaintiff to complete the undertakings given at the examination of Walter Guylas November 30, 2004 within 30 days.  3) The Court reviewed all the relevant facts, which it had reviewed and was sensitive to the on the ground realities of litigation with the aim of achieving a result which is just, the Court concluded that this was not a case where the application for dismissal for the plaintiff’s want for prosecution should be granted. 4) It was in the interests of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the delay. All parties were cautioned to now proceed diligently and without further delay. Failure to do so will no doubt cause the defendant to consider making a further application. 5) The application for payment of $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid and retained by the latter are live issues raised by the pleadings. The context in which the delay in this case occurred was straight forward, with neither party having undertaken extensive communications with the other. The defendant, either because it considered the matter settled or alternatively was content to wait until the case had gone away, to do nothing to encourage a more timely disposition of it until the 2009 correspondence, is not blameless respecting its contribution to the delay and is not seeking to deprive the plaintiff of a chance to succeed.  6) The length of the delay was comparable to that experienced in the ICC case. It was not sufficient to warrant dismissal."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused argued that since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting off a driving error, the court need not enter the analysis of whether the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperative motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person that was occupying the driver's seat was incapable of providing a sample of his breath and that he required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2)Although the accused may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused and, in coming to his conclusion, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the potential seriousness of the assault, the head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and the length of time it would take to treat the victim and keep him under observation. 3)All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle pursuant to ss.255 and s253(b). 4)There was no evidence of impairment by reason of his physical condition which would have prejudiced the accused's s.10(b) rights to counsel. 5)The Court found it necessary to exclude the Certificate of Analysis as it had no remedy of exclusion in relation to the other counts."

The fee was taxed in the amount of $50 with leave to reapply to set a specific number if PWC and the Superintendent cannot agree what should be done.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(3) as the provisions of the personal property security act apply. 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having received a pension or any other benefit from the plan. The proposal to transfer the interest to a third party which did not include an attachable pension did not comply with s.7.03 of the Plan Contract. 3)Since the applicant was not a party to the plan contract, there was no monetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer had been made by her. 4)The loan agreement had no provisions prohibiting the applicant from setting off her indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it. Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired the benefits from the pension will be payable immediately upon the commencement of her employment and therefore there appears no case of her receiving a pension from the Plan contract immediately upon her retirement age, the provision of a commutation and surrender clause in the plan did not apply. 5)No special dispensation or order respecting the transfer of the assets under the plan to any third party was granted in any event.  6)Each party was entitled to a share in the proceeds of the sale of any assets in the company pursuant to the terms of the plan Contract and the reasons in Chambersburg v.

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the mother. The petitioner wishes to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. The issues on the proposed relocation are whether it is in the children's best interests to relocate the child to Edmonton with the respondent; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child in Edmonton. HELD: 1) The child's psychological parent and psychological home was with the petitioner. The respondent's primary residence was with her. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the future, the child was not allowed to relocate to Edmonton. 3) The respondent would lose the bond he now enjoys with his child. The child would become an access parent and the child would no longer benefit from Harley's co- parenting. 4) The evidence on the respondent's motivation to relocate was that he was concerned that his child would lose his bond with his new sibling. 5) The court was cognizant of the fact that the respondent had expressed an intention to move to Edmonton rather than Saskatoon, and it was pertinent to consider whether the move was in the best interests of the children. 6) The applicant's reasons for moving were found to be inconsistent with best interests. 7) The petitioner was granted access to the child at his parent's home. 8) The application judge's misapprehension of the existing parenting arrangement had significant consequences. The applicant would lose contact with his extended family in Edmonton, and the move would cause the respondent to lose the relationship with her to lose. 9) The Court was mindful of the comments in Gordon v. Goertz (1996) that a parent's reason for relocating is only relevant in exceptional circumstances where it impacts on that parent's ability to meet the needs of their child. A more precise test would risk sacrificing the child's best interest to expediency and certainty. It is not necessary for the court to deal with this as have declined to allow the relocation of the respondent."
e_1999canlii12492.txt,"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother. The Department had been very much involved and the decision by the Minister to make the present application was not taken in haste. The mother, who had separated from the husband and was much too irresponsible to have the care and control of all of their children, had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) since the birth of the oldest child. She had been relying on the husband to protect the children from domestic disharmony and domestic violence that had been part of the pattern of living in the foster home for the past six years. The children had been and will continue to be in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi) of the Act. HELD: 1)An officer of the department has recommended permanent committal.  2)The foster parents have been in good health and the prognosis is not good. There is no possibility that the children will be adopted by the foster parents. 3)The mother is incapable of supervising or protecting the children. She has always been anxious about excusing the mother rather than doing the proper thing. She chooses alcohol over both and the children and has been in denial of this or to excuse it. 4)There has been a clear evidence that the mother does not have the competency to parent one of the three children on her own. The evidence also indicates that she has been unable or unwilling to exercise enough responsibility to properly supervise or protect the parents."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and the court was of the view they had the opposite effect. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The tapes demonstrated the level of abuse in the petitioner's home. The court found that the tapes had the effect of discrediting the mother's parenting regime and demonstrating the abuse that was occurring in the father’s home. Because the tapes were taped, the father was unable to obtain access to the home and the children were subjected to a protracted outburst from the father about the fact that the mother was not allowed to wear black lipstick. The evidence showed that the father encouraged the children to come whenever they wanted and the voices were properly identified."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the petitionerers that they should become involved, failed or refused to pay the petitioner. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due by having ceased to make payments. 2)It was common ground that the petitioner had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The Petitioners had repeatedly demanded that he pay the indebtedness owing to them. No adequate explanation had been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his obligations. 3)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant a receiving order."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645. The parties had agreed in May 2011 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to reflect the change in custody from the defendant's current annual guideline income to $129,495. The defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his daughter to that of his current spouse and applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include a change in the number of children in his care. The trial judge found the 2008 variation order to be an interim order and the defendant failed to find any change in circumstances. In 2012, the defendant filed an application for variation of the 2006 consent order. The issues on appeal are whether the Court can vary an interim or final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles but by the Divorce Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) It is important not to confuse the lines of authority. The 2008 Variation order was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement and the Court found that it was not intended to be final order and was subject to further determination by the Court. 2) In Frey, it has become accepted that there is no expressly legislated power to vary final order or determination. The Court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 3) The Court has not been asked to overrule Frey, nor do think it is necessary to consider doing so."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the decision of the trial judge in relation to custody and access.

2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found guilty of both charges. 1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There was no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help and then rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened. As the witness testified, the accused got loose from the trailer and picked up two by four and headed toward the house. The complainant thought better of it because there was no evidence of what happened next and he testified that he was punched in the face and the window was smashed in.  2) The Court found both accused guilty of assault upon the complainant and wilfully damage to the car windows. The Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000.  3) The second count was dismissed."
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal was dismissed as there was ample evidence which supported the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the appellant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt."
7_1992canlii2622.txt,"The trial judge's decision fixing a retroactive effective date for child support was also upheld as there was no error on the part of the trial judge in fixing the date.,the Appeal Division upheld the trial judge's decision which did not include in the division of matrimonial assets a bank account held in the wife's name alone where the uncontradicted evidence of the wife was that the spouses had agreed when the wife went back into the work force that anything she earned would be hers. At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","This was an appeal from a corollary relief judgment dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to their effective commencement date. The appellant sought an earlier effective date so he could obtain income tax deductions for monies he said he paid prior to March 1, 1991 covering largely expenses relating to the matrimony home in which he was living with the children. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not err in not finding that this spent money should be included in the division."
3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals the decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with cost on double Column V. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court.

b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal a decision dismissing its summary judgment application. The chambers judge found that the plaintiff had met the test for summary judgment and then that the plaintiffs met the onus on them to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident. The onus was also placed on the plaintiff to prove the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events, and if their evidence was accepted by a trier of fact, their action had some merit. The application for summary judgement was dismissed on the basis that the chambers judge blurred two parts of the test: 1) the plaintiff's affidavit was not properly presented through other affidavits; and 2) the Chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test in the affidavits. All of the evidence referred to by the judge in the decision and required for determination of the issues was also contained in the affidavit.

The respondent has costs at double Column V.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held"

Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff purchased specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of the specialty crops.

The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff received a copy of the executed agreement. 2)The contract was legally binding. 3)The parties communicated in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. 4)The impurities and hulled seed count shall be established in accordance with procedure and standards used by the Canadian Grain Commission and included as foreign material. 5)The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and confirmed that a contract did exist. The post office received the original signed contract in May 1993 and both parties considered that they had a binding and legally enforceable contract in November and in November 1993.

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered at their expense the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that there was a clear conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. HELD: The appeal was allowed and his conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. 1)The court found that the trial judge erred when he failed to strike the offending evidence, in allowing into evidence the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst, the videotape re-enactment and the related still photographs. These photographs did not prove anything so it was not necessary for the defendant to object to their admission.  2)There was a lot to be gained by having the expert's report admitted into evidence. The evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court also found that some of the issues raised by the appeal court were not raised at the time of the criminal appeal. 3)A rational and justifiable choice was made to challenge the unhelpful conclusions in Cst. Thivierge's report through cross-examination rather than through an effort to have the whole report excluded from evidence."
c_2006skpc93.txt,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. HELD: 1)The restriction placed on the plaintiff by the defendant was not in her personal capacity. She was acting in her capacity and did not know if the work was outstanding at the time of the vote. 2)Even if the defendant's decision did infringe the plaintiff's right to expression to some extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the sections of the rural municipality act, the requirement has not been met. 3)The plaintiff was not prepared to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on her. 4)The dispute between the plaintiff and defendant was a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. The dispute was best left to the ratepayers to deal with at municipal election."

The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence.

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S., Ch. 11 as amended and states that the Plaintiff's only possible claim is for workers' compensation benefits from the WCC. The Defendant states the Claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to SaskTel. 1) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. Having reviewed the pleadings carefully, I conclude that Mr. Schutte's claims have no reasonable prospects of success and should be struck."
d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s.254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make the formal breath demand. The wording of the section is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. The importance of noting such a material aspect as alcohol coming from the vehicle in this type of investigation is vital. The absence of any reference to it in all five documented reports raises potential disclosure issues at least and compels the Court to conclude the officer may well be mistaken in this regard. 3)There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused."

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent’s position was not blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner”s category.  1) There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the income tax return or notice of assessment annually. The respondent had been content to accept $380.00 as fair level of child support for both children. 2) The petitioner and respondent had agreed in 1999 that joint custody of the children would be increased by $50 per month. 3) In 2001 the respondent became unemployed and received employment insurance. The petitioner was provided reasonable access. 4) In 2003 the respondent and the petitioner agreed that the failure to disclose her tax return on June 30, 2004 and each June 30 thereafter constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. 5) In 2004 the respondent made an informal adjustment to monthly child support. The primary residence of both children changed to be with the respondent. 6) The respondent was content to pay $380 per month until July 2006. 7) In 2008 the respondent began paying $1,000 less per month as child support increased. 8) In 2009 the respondent paid $2,500 less child support than he had previously paid. 9) In 2010 the respondent stopped paying. 10) In 2012 the respondent started paying less. 11) In 2013 the petitioner paid less. The Supreme Court of Canada concluded that it was not possible to find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier other than that he accepted $380 as reasonable in the circumstances."

The physical evidence, taken together with the exhibits, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability. 3)The scales were evenly balanced and the plaintiff was not satisfied that one version of facts was correct and the other was incorrect.

Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant, he could have outrun the police officer who was driving the Tempo. In fact, the trial judge made comments that led the jury to conclude that the appellant's credibility was not impaired by the fact that he was not called to testify."

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment, the Crown stayed counts and granted a credit of two for one for the full remand time. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to four years and nine months from 10 years. The credit should be one for one because of the time constraints which necessarily are a part of the process. The time actually served on remand was 1,336 days. For that period, he should receive credit of 4 years and 9 months. The discretion to grant the credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section.  1) The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. 2) There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 3) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is more important is the dollar value of the goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted. 4) The Court held that sentencing the accused who pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently personating various persons, living or dead, with an intent to gain advantage for himself or another person, was sentenced to eight years and six months imprisonment for the time spent in custody. 5) The sentencing guidelines were met. The accused had no income and would not have any for some time. The sentencing guideline was set out in R. v. Ursel (1997), 1997 CanLII 12512 (MB CA), 118 Man. R. (2d) 103 (C.A.) and [2010] B.C.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Chambers judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The learned judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. He also held that the respondent had priority over the other claimants based on the dates of registration. Allowing the appeal and ordering the payment of the sum to the Eskasoni Band, that the failure of the respondent to give notice to the Band in August 1990 was grounds for an Interpleader."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location and destroyed the plaintiff's building. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The plaintiff moved for production of all documents relating to the second fire. Specifically: a complete copy of any investigative files prepared by government authorities, including the Fire Marshall and the Town of Stellarton Fire Department; any photographs of the aftermath of the fire; any internal investigation, any of the file of any insurers who carried out investigations; and any other relevant files. The defendant submits the documents are not relevant to the present action. HELD: The motion was dismissed. Rule 14.01 displaced the former semblance of relevancy test and the range of discloseable documents has been narrowed to relevance. This requires motions judge to decide relevantly based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. Rule 15 imposes a duty on defendant to disclose relevant documents."
e_2004skca31.txt,"This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, I declined to do so for these reasons. The case is more like Faber v. Retzlaff,[1] Fiacco v. Fiacco[2] and Fick v. Fick [3] than Latsay, Kuhn, Bitternose, and Murray v. Murray. While the chambers judge determined that the best interests of the children required the status quo to be maintained, there was only one occasion only during that period when the children did not have access to both parents in any six-day period (leaving aside the January vacation). This was to be contrasted with the upcoming two months which would see the children not having overnight access, or indeed, any access, to their mother during four 6-day periods until the appeal was heard. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The case parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, on an interim basis, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift a stay, and to maintain the schedule existing prior to its decision under appeal. As it turns out, final reasons were filed that day, but because notice of appeal in relation to those reasons was filed almost immediately, Wright J.'s order came into effect and has been in effect for the past 2 weeks. For greater clarity, they are in week no. 2.  2)Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of the previous maintenance order did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. Accordingly, the parties are to be governed by the order of Wright J unless otherwise agreed and until further order. 3)The judgment roll 'vacates' the respondent's order."
5_2009nssc218.txt,"The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar. He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings committed in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The two accused remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. The offence was particularly serious given the fact that the accused possessed a firearm at the time of the shootings and because of the fear instilled in the community by the presence and use of handguns. The accused had a prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. HELD: The global sentence to be imposed is one of years, months incarceration.  1) An aggravating factor was that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. 2) The accused was sentenced to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a credit for time spent on pre- trial release, leaving a global sentence of 15 months. 3) The court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused in order to arrive at a fit and proper sentence. The offences were committed in an environment where there was a high level of gun ownership and the presence of those who were prepared to use the handguns they carry regardless of the consequences to others. The risk posed by such shootings to law-abiding citizens who are going about their daily business is high and increasing. A clear message must be sent to those in our community who believe in living by the gun and settling their disputes through the use of a gun. There will be severe consequences for those who behave in such fashion."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The first issue before the court arises from the voir dire and concerns whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the warrant to search for blood samples issued pursuant to s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure has been invalid. The warrant was invalid and there was a breach of the accused's s.8 rights. The officer who swore the information to obtain, when reviewed as a whole, did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253. Further, the Court found that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient grounds to admit into evidence. The Certificate of Analysis was not sufficient as it did not include the source of his belief regarding the driver's alcohol content and the rest of his body slumped across the seat of the vehicle. HELD: 1) The information was insufficient to warrant a search warrant. 2) The officer failed to communicate the basic information required of a warrant to be executed, which was the essence of the justification for the warrant, and 3) There were no reasonable grounds upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory pre-conditions were met. 4) There was a factual element to the warrant which was not addressed in the summary judgment judgment. 5) The officers were not required to provide sufficient detail to permit the justice of the peace to determine whether the warrant should be issued. The summary judgment judgement was satisfied and the accused was found not guilty."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, which held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could be varied after payment. For the appellant and the respondent, that there was a jurisdictional question concerning the payment of lump sum in 1985 which had not been paid back. The respondent had made no further payment since that time and had not had contact with the child. In 1993, the appellant made an application for variation of this order pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. At issue was whether an order for payment of maintenance or expenses was a unique creation of the old Children of Unmarried Parents Act and was governed by the principles of that Act, which are outside the legislative scheme of the FAM. Awarding the appeal to the Court of Appeal, that the decision was determinative. Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court. This was a very brief decision from a Family Court Judge and various memoranda of counsel submitted to the judge were examined along with a copy of an affidavit of the respondent filed before the judge. No transcript of evidence was placed before the court and no affidavit had been placed before it. The general principles favouring the claimant must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute and the order made under it."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

Both parents wanted sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy had lived alternating weeks with each parent. HELD: The father's obligation under the Federal Child Support Guidelines was $226 per month. He asked the mother to share the extraordinary cost of $40 per month for horse riding lessons. She thought the cost was necessary for the boy's established routine and under the circumstances, reasonable. The mother's proportional share of $28 per month was added to the father's share. 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother withdraws from the workplace. 2)The mother's obligation to pay child support commenced on the first day of the month following the time she makes herself available for full-time parenting of the boy. 3)The father was to have access onalternating weekends and for a three-hour period on one weekday each week. 4)Leave was given to apply for further directions."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and did not make an application for a pension. In October 1996, DND, without the plaintiff's involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The defence of the Crown in this action was based on s. 111 of the Pension Act, which states that if the plaintiff is eligible for pension benefits as described in the Federal Court of Appeal decision, this claim is statute-barred. It is also inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension, that she is precluded from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time. Alternatively, an individual accepting the Minister's denial but believing for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy against the Crown counsel's position would require the plaintiff to pursue meaningless appeals simply to meet the conditions of s. and s.111."

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990, an assessment was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded on January 14, 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that the Act does not give the aircraft situs there to support tax which constitutionally must be 'within the Province'. In the case of aircraft operations, there must be substantial, at least more than nominal, presence in order to provide a basis for imposing tax in respect of the entry of aircraft into the province."" This is an appeal by the Minister of Finance under the Health Services Tax Act. The Act, in its general structure and intent, closely resembles the type of enactment originally approved by the courts in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. v. Conlon, 1943 CanLII 372 (UK JCPC), [1943] D.L.R. (4th) 218 (S.C.C.) and later generalized to include all tangible personal property. The primary purpose of s. 2(4) is to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax. It is a provision which, if enacted, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121. All Articles of Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall be admitted free into each of the other provinces. This predominant purpose, in the view of the Board, was to prevent the evasion of the tax and consequent loss of revenue by the simple expedient of consumer purchasing goods outside the province for his own consumption or use."
3_2003skqb257.txt,"The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan. He became ill while teaching a class. His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's claim for compensation based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The justice of waiving the six-month limitation period involves an examination of the reasons for the delay and the substantive merits of the claim.  2)Section 45(1)(b) of the Act states that if there is no evidence to show the cause of death, it is presumed that the death was the result of an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. 3)The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard. 4)Section 47 does not bar the board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board' in the case of the deceased. 5)The respondent Board must approach the application of Section 30 by firstly determining if the worker was found dead. The application for dependent benefits was submitted over 3 years after the death had occurred and on that basis alone, the claim for the claim could be denied. 6)The privative clause found in s.45 does not apply in the circumstances. If the evidence shows the death is not work-related, the policies must not take the Board beyond the discretion afforded to them by the statute."

The plaintiff is chartered accountant who was partner with the defendant. 2000 merger agreement signed by the plaintiff indicated that the Courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes between the parties. After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership. HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration.","FIAT: The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act, 1992. The plaintiff was a chartered accountant. He joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement in 1999. In 1999, MNP gave notice to the plaintiff that his partnership arrangement would be terminated effective September 30, 2009. On May 10, 2011, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the C.E.O., which served as formal notice to Laidlaw that he required his dispute with Meyers Norris Penny LLP to be referred to arbitration.

Effective September 1, 2000, LaidLaw was admitted as a principal partner of the MNP, subject to terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement.

There are no other provisions in s.8(2) that apply to this situation that may result in refusal to stay the proceedings. HELD: The stay is granted pursuant to ss. 8(1) and 24.1 of the Arbitration act.  1) The Court shall stay the action pending the commencement of the arbitration proceeding pursuant to section 19 of the Act.  2) The arbitration agreement is in direct conflict with the choice of law in clause 1.5 of the MERGER agreement which gives Saskatchewan and its courts the exclusive jurisdiction in determining all disputes, claims and arbitration according to the Province of Alberta. The issue must be decided by the courts, not the arbitrator. The agreement and the evidence in this case allude to the same arbitration clause which purports to give an arbitrator the authority to resolve disputes, interpret law according to Alberta. 3) The claim does not rely on either the merger or partnership agreement and, as here, the determination of the validity of the arbitration agreement requires an interpretation of the agreement. The issues argued were not the same as those put forward by the plaintiff in this action. 4) The only change in evidence was that the arbitration agreement could no longer apply as the plaintiff was no longer a member of the partnership.  5) The plaintiff did not submit to arbitration a request for stay.  6) The Commission did not file an order pursuant"
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the judgment and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The Court held that it would be in the children's best interests to have the matter proceed to a pre-trial conference as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child had been in the petitioner’s care for several months and was doing well in the program. The issue of increasing parenting time was a new matter that arose during the course of an action and was not a variation of the existing order."

He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused pled guilty to a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for a period of 18 months on certain specific conditions. A 10 year firearm, ammunition and explosive substance prohibition order was made against the accused pursuant to the provisions of s. 100(1) of the Code. The accused appealed the sentence of six months imprisonment to an 18 month prohibition order which had been imposed on him for 15 days after he had served 15 days of the sentence. He commenced serving the noted sentence on August 4, 1994. On August 18, 1994, the accused applied for release from custody pending the hearing and determination of his present appeal. The subject appeal came before the Court of Appeal and reduced the term of imprisonment imposed at trial from 6 months to 6 months and the 18 month probation order subject only to amending the time within which he was to report to the chief probation officer as therein provided. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence imposed was too severe for the particular circumstances and the sentence imposed ought to be reduced to time already served. 2)The prohibited substances prohibition order had been reduced to a ten year prohibition order for the offence of possession of firearms for the purpose of trafficking. 3)The accused was convicted of assault with an explosive substance which was not a Schedule II offence. He was prohibited from possessing firearms following his sentence. 4)A ten-year firearm and ammunition and explosives prohibition order did not exist. The Provincial Court judgeerred in making this prohibition order. 5)The appeal against the sentence was allowed against it and set aside. The appeal against it was set aside on the grounds of protection of society, punishment, deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms in order to keep his child in the home. He believed the agreement of joint custody would protect his interests. 2) There was no evidence to suggest that mobility would become an issue at some point. 3) The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. 4) The father failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause. Instead of explicitly indicating his intent he assumed the joint custody order would protect him. The terms of their agreement clearly favoured the mother; the father gave the consideration required to finalize their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. 5) The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances of the parties the court can review the terms of the separation agreement in this divorce proceeding and set an appropriate amount of support."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate it was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence was to the effect that when stopped by the police he was suffering from a panic attack. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.) or that his evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  2)Although the accused testified that he was into his panic attack, his evidence was that he worked hard, stressed out about his marriage, and was not sleeping well. He also displayed some symptoms of a panic disorder. 3)The blood alcohol content of the accused was.60. The blood pressure readings were.70. 4)The accused had been diagnosed as suffering from general anxiety disorder. The symptoms of impairment displayed by the accused were: sweating, shortness of breath, coughing, and a very bad slurred speech. He had been advised of his right to retain and instruct without delay. He took advantage of his Charter right to have his blood alcohol levels at the level of legal limit set at.08. 5)There was no evidence that the accused had a generalized panic attack or that he had been involved in any of the incidents described in this affidavit. The only evidence that could be attributed was that the police officer had prescribed a mild dose of Librium to calm the accused who was very unsteady on his feet."
d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she wanted to put before the court on her appeals. The respondents' motions to dismiss her Criminal Appeal and to have them pay to certify the transcripts were granted. HELD: The appeal was dismissed for failure to perfect.  1) Rule 90.40(2) provides the court with an authority to order the respondents to pay the costs necessary to process and process the transcript. 2) The Court's function is generally to review a specific decision of a specific judge or tribunal for error. It was not satisfied that these appeals raised common question of fact or law, involve the same occurrences or are in the interests of the parties. 3) The appellant's motions to consolidate her two appeals and have the respondent pay for the certification of their transcripts are granted."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at or near.08. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he did not do. 3)Although the accused's response in stopping was delayed and he braked abruptly, the officer noted that it was windy at the time, which may have caused him to weave somewhat in his lane and he was required to slow and pull over to the shoulder as he passed the vehicle in the immediate vicinity. 4)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused. 5)Although there was some evidence of impairment on the Crown's part, the Court found that the accused had not shown any symptoms of it. The accused’s appearance was somewhat dazed and his appearance was not that of a person who had been drinking alcohol the previous day but rather was moving in a slow and deliberate manner.  6)There was no other evidence offered by the RCMP as to the level of impairment offered by their tests. The Court noted that most importantly, there was no suggestion that there had been anything of note either in the timing of the stop, the manner of braking, the braking or the presence of alcohol in the vehicle."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and the trial date is after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. 2)The trial date was near the outside deadline. There was good reason for the matter to be extended for a trial beyond the date of the overall deadline. 3)Any attempt to make an order after trial that operates beyond any statutory time deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. 4)The Court has not lost its jurisdiction in this matter. The trial will commence tomorrow."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with a number of offences, including robbery with a firearm. The police stopped the car and found the accused in it minutes after it was stopped in Fairview. The accused pleaded guilty to the robbery and the possession of the gun and brass knuckles. At trial, the accused testified that he had not been in Sackville at all and had nothing to do with any robbery. She said that the police had stopped to pick up people from the house where the robbery took place and the accused had been picked up just few minutes before. The evidence at trial suggested that the accused’s failure to identify him might be a factor in his decision to rob the accused. HELD: The accused was found in the car with a gun and the stolen property and in the company of a person who had been recognized as the robbery victim. The court found that the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious. The fact that he was sitting on the bench with the gun in his hand and the person he was picked up with was not the only person who was familiar with the robbery. The circumstantial evidence did not support the idea that this was a case where the accused should have taken more time to identify and distinguish between the two groups. The admissibility of the accused and the absence of a description of the second and third assailants was not enough to satisfy the court. There was an opportunity for the Crown to prove that the third and the fourth assailants were the same people who robbed the victim."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was found not guilty on all of the counts. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood sold to the undercover officer was wood coming from Crown lands. Therefore, the conviction should be quashed. The Court of Queen's Bench stated that it was not satisfied that during the period the defendant harvested wood from Crown land and that he also sold wood from private lands, the Crown should not have taken this as an admission, as it was clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided a term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law, which the parties clearly intended to be an implied term. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that they cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)The use of the word 'arbitration' in the meaning of s.45(2) of the Act does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that 'it goes without saying', in the factual matrix of this case. 3)The term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. It is trite law that parties who have commercial contractual relationship, which contains an arbitration agreement for dispute resolution, can, by agreement, abrogate appellate review of the arbitrator's decision. The Court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 4)A term permitting a appeal on questions of law simply does not form part of the implied term and, as such, it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. Such an implied word is not akin, for instance, to the expressed term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the implied terms of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is evidence of contrary intention on the part of either party, it must be found. 5)In this case, the parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permitted. The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which a appeal could be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional. 6)The agreement between the parties (the IDSL, the SCA and the ESMA) did not permit the application and, therefore, the application must be dismissed."

She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's side window. The defendant engaged two experts who examined the metal and reported it did not come from the tractor trailer. The plaintiff asserted damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. Defendant's application to dismiss the action dismissed on the basis that the plaintiff's discovery evidence was not bare allegation, but material fact that if accepted at trial the plaintiff would have been able to demonstrate that her claim was not entirely or solely arising through negligence.

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code.

The complainant's evidence was not supported by expert testimony.  2)Although the accused had an opportunity and was reasonably capable of living up to it, the evidence did not confirm it.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. The evidence from the father's witnesses differed materially from that given by the mother. HELD: Custody and access were granted to the father with a review date. The information provided by the father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was credible. It was not appropriate to place the children in the sole custody of the father. Decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and their future were to be made by the Father. He was to pay the set-off amount (which was $502 per month) which was to commence January 1, 2012. The parties had separated in 2009. There had been significant changes in the circumstances and the father had not always been as respectful of the mother as he should have been. However, the evidence showed that he had always been willing to help the children with their medical and dental needs and was able to meet their various needs."

The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of seven offences relating to careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy. He also contended that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. HELD: The appellant was released on terms set out in R. v. Renacci (1993), 86 C.C.C.(3d) 32 at 48. The grounds of appeal were weak on the basis that the appellant was a flight risk and his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate. The appellant had no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report and had been on bail for 16 months without incident. The offences were very serious and the appellant had a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. The circumstances that the Crown suggested made the appellant a 'flight risk' had nothing to do with the charges he had faced or the convictions that resulted. The principles of reviewability, enforceability of convictions and the minimum sentence provisions were unconstitutional."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the requested order because of the affidavit evidence. It was not the defendant's intention in the matter to expand on the evidence in the affidavit."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time.  2)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 3)There will be instances where the defence, through no fault of its own, cannot provide a detailed summary of what it anticipates it will call in the charter application. In such circumstances, the accused must demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he/she is entitled and entitled to a Charter remedy and must assert that entitlement at the earliest possible point of trial. In this case, defence counsel should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made. There is no evidence to support the assertion that objections to admissiblilty of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered. In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made in May 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties divorced in 1998. The petitioner mother had the use of his father's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam. When she returned in August 2006, Michael began living with his mother. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Michael resumed living with the mother and was supported by his grandmother. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly causes their children. 2)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is necessary that there be a shared parenting regime in place, the Court must take into account three factors: the Table support applicable to each party; the increased costs associated with the shared custody arrangements; and the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and the children for whom support is sought. 3)Sole custody arrangement: the mother's income is $25,672.37. The father's proportionate share is 80% and mother's is 20%. The current s. expenses total $4,261.80. 4)The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 for health related expenses. 5)It is not practical to order the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. Two incidents illustrate why not. The mother paid for dental appointments in the fall of 2006 and submitted the charge to the father's insurer for reimbursement. He refused in turn to remit the payment to the mother. 6)Costs in the amount of $284.00 for s. 7 expenses."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","A summary conviction appeal from a judgment in September 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were: 1) the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count in convicting the appellant; 2) the trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence of the central Crown witness as he provided exculpatory evidence; and 3) the appellant did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. The trial judge was in better position to judge the appellant's credibility on the issue of his intention than the SCAC judge or this court who must rely on the written record."

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the defendant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and leave to him to commence a derivative action. The defendant had previously been a director of the company. He now worked for the defendant and filed a defence and counterclaim admitting certain allegations in the statement of claim. At issue was whether the defendant's need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts was a strong reason for concluding it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. HELD: The defendant was granted leave to appeal. The appeal was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not shown that he was acomplainant under s. 7(5)(b) of the Third Schedule or s.5(1), because he misinterpreted the effect of the April 2004 consent order, referred to in the statements of claim, which alleged that Oickle surreptitiously competed against the company during his employment, appropriated opportunities that would have been available to the company, and misused company resources to support his competition. 2)There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request. There were no errors or omissions by the defendant on the first ground. The second ground was that the judge erred by making his decision in the absence of evidence indicating that it was just to withdraw the admissions. 3)The judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order. The words of the consent order approved in Abacus were that 'a judicial admission should be allowed to be withdrawn if, in the circumstances, the court is satisfied it is in the interest of justice to withdraw same.' 4)The court found no error in applying the less restrictive test used in the Abacus case and dismissed the appeal. 5)Rule 21.02(4) permits the withdrawal of admissions at any time.

e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Crown applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code. The Chambers judge granted the release with conditions, pending the appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000. The applicant argued the judge misinterpreted the definition of custody by granting the 679 application. He argued this is a case of first impression and raised issues that should be considered by a panel of the Court of Appeal. Allowing the release, that the decision of the Chambers judge was misinterpreted in law and that the issue of whether or not a person on a day parole is in custody would never have arisen if the appellant was serving his time in custody in Penitentiary rather than in custody. Counsel for the Crown relied upon his submission that the applicant was not in custody, therefore, the court of appeal should have received a direction in the direction of the Chief Justice on the basis that the appellant, who was on parole prior to the application in the first place, was in custody within the meaning of s.679. The Crown appealed that decision and sought a review of the decision. The chambers judge issued a written decision on October 19, 1999, granting the release without conditions. In an amended order dated October 26, 1999 it was amended to change several of the conditions to reflect the change in the circumstances of the case. In a dissenting opinion, the dissenting judge wrote that a decision under section 679 may not be appealed on a direction by a Court of appeal and that decision may, if it does not confirm the decision, vary the decision; or substitute such other decision as should have been made. The dissenting judge cited in his dissenting opinion that the Crown had jurisdiction to hear the appellant's application for judicial interim release (P&L). Counsel for Crown sought to conclude that a requirement to exercise custody custody in addition to any other case law cited in the dissenting opinion was not a requirement for the return of any other cases on this issue and that a request for a parole request was not made in light of the other cases cited and the requirement that a parole application be returned to the Crown on a parole board for the purposes of the parole request and a direction to the appellant to return to custody in the form of an appeal rather than a letter of the Crown requesting a"

Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been placed in the care of the psychological father because of instability in the home, the risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child, and that there was a risk of the child suffering harm as a result of the abuse. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of s. 45 for the purposes of protection finding. Testimony was received from the mother, child protection worker, the biological father, the mother's sister and a psychologist. HELD: 1) The burden of proof in proceeding such as this is clearly on the Agency. It is a civil burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. 2) The child was apprehended in April 2004 because of unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The apartment was in disarray and the mother was living alone. The parties did not cooperate in addressing the risk factors that affected the child's health and safety. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which the respondent's actions were in breach of the provisions of the Act. It was unnecessary to ask the court to return the child who had been removed from her care and who had not been apprehended by the Agency prior to that date. 4) Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent the respondent. The respondent's attendance at a risk management conference meeting was limited to two people. 5) The respondent was not prepared to participate in any counselling sessions. 6) Counseling was not available to the parties. 7) The court was unable to decide whether or not to order the respondent to pay child support or to provide counselling. 8) Counsel must consult with the parties on issues of custody and access. 9) Counsel is not responsible for decisions that affect the children's well-being. 10) There is no evidence that the respondent will be able to protect the child from harm if returned to its care. 11) Counsel cannot advise the Agency on the best way to proceed with custody decisions. 12) Counsel will not be permitted to advise the respondent on any of the above."

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s.9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The Crown objected and the accused waived his right to a trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established by the Supreme Court of Canada. 2)The applicant waived or part of it such that the remainder is not unreasonable.  3)There is no evidence that institutional delay of 13 months is the norm in other metro provincial courts.

The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the Gold Key Lease has none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Issues #2 and #3 were whether the lease agreement was actually a rental contract pursuant to s.62 of the Act, nor the claim that Chysler was an owner pursuant to sec. 2(ak).  4) The only potential application of s. 248 in this case was the issuance of a judgment to Chrysler. The reverse onus provision did not apply. 5) In Bazley, supra, the Court was addressing whether a non-employee corporation, operating two residential care facilities for the treatment of emotionally troubled children, could impose strict liability on the corporation for the intentional actions of the members of local. The trial judge concluded that only after a full trial, if the judge might examine all the surrounding circumstances or where the circumstances could be considered, would it be possible to decide if waiver had occurred.  6) The Chambers judge correctly cited the test and found that the lease arrangement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62. 7) The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions in the Act. The Act is contemplating a situation distinct from a lease with an option to purchase as described in sec. 62. A review of the relevant statute and regulations would be appropriate to consider whether a lease agreement falls within the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.'  8) There was no material change in the circumstances or in the manner in which the plaintiff entered the agreement. 9) There were no issues of credibility and no need to weigh the evidence with respect to the version of events. 10) The lease agreement did not have the characteristics that would have been considered in Bazley. 11) The Chamber judge failed to provide any analysis of the Bazley criteria and in failing to do so committed an error of law."
e_2004skqb388.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and with driving while threatening the complainant, who was lying on the ground. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The court found no reasonable doubt as to the intention of the accused. The evidence showed that the accused had been drinking and smoking marijuana. When he got out of the truck he pushed the complainant down on the concrete driveway and then pushed her down twice and kicked her in the head. The court concluded that the driving was dangerous to the public and found the accused guilty of this charge. 2) The accused operated the motor vehicle in a dangerous manner to the general public. The injuries to the complainant were accidental and the bruises were caused by the assault. The accused admitted to stabbing the complainant in the face and in doing so caused her bodily harm. There was no evidence that he got more aggressive and kicked the complainant on two occasions and the evidence of tire marks on the driveway was overwhelming. The Crown must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the accused’s intention. There were strong suspicions the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle and there was reasonable doubt about his intention. However, the Crown had failed to prove the guilt of this accused on these counts beyond a reasonable doubt."

The applicants were parents of children who attended one of the two closed schools., application allowed in part; certiorari granted in respect of the decision to close the school which the applicants' children attended; the applicants had no standing to challenge the closure of the second school as they were not directly affected by its closure. The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue. The Board did not meet the onus on it to show that the member had appropriate firsthand knowledge of the evidence and submission of the applicants.","This was an application advanced by seven applicants for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 56 in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Board to close the two schools. All seven applicants are parents of children attending the school and none of the applicants have children attending Notting Park. The applicant also raises an issue of standing. HELD: 1) There has not been been established the applicants directly affected by the closure of the school. The Board stated the recommendation from the School Review Committee, that 79 students be transferred from Notting Park to Northbrook, permits it to be said the applicants are aggrieved persons. There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion. 2) Public interest standing will not normally be granted if it is realistic to expect that the issue in dispute will be resolved in another forum or in a different proceeding, at the instance of person who would have standing. There are no practical prospects for the applicant to emerge as better plaintiffs with a reasonable prospect of emergence.

d_2001skqb47.txt,"The 18 year old, charged with the second degree murder of two individuals, applied for release from custody. HELD: The accused was released on his own undertakings under a set of strict conditions, including participation in an electronic monitoring program. The onus is on the accused to show cause why his detention in custody is not justified. Criminal Code s.515(10) now permits detention on three grounds. His detention was not necessary to ensure his attendance at court nor for the protection or safety of the public. There was no evidence he posed a substantial likelihood of committing further offences or that he would interfere with the administration of justice if released. There was no other just cause, including maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice.","The accused was charged with second and third degree murder. HELD: The accused was released on strict conditions. He was to reside at a residence with his mother and siblings. The accused had always been involved in school, sports and community activities. He had two outstanding charges arising out of a house party in October 1999. In the meantime, the accused had been charged with assault causing bodily harm and assault with weapon. During the course of his trial, police were called to the residence where the accused was found. A gun was discharged while he was in custody. At issue was the detention of the accused on the basis that his detention was necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.  1)Section 515(10) of the Criminal Code provides for detention if the accused has a strong case, the offence charged is extremely grave, and that a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment is in the offing. More is required.  2)The accused has always lived with his family. His father has managed the community pasture for 16 years. His mother and father have managed the home in the First Nation for four years. He is the son of a trust coordinator for a First Nation. His previous record consists of two charges of mischief for which he received a discharge. He has participated in the Electronic Monitoring Program and will comply with all Program rules. He will be confined to his residence and receive written permission from the IPSEM Co-ordinator or his designate to be absent from his residence. He shall be responsible for any changes in attendance at an educational facility or any contact with police officials. He must keep the peace and be of good behaviour. The positions of the parties diverge as to his age. It does not appear to be in issue that both the accused and the deceased were members of their First Nation prior to the events occurring. It is satisfied in all of the circumstances that the continued detention can be justified under the law as laid down by Parliament."
9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act.  It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. The child was essentially abandoned by both his parents from the time he was a toddler until he was 10 or 11 years old. Both the mother and father had abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, who currently resided with the mother. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, was of considerable concern. The school year will commence shortly and the child is to have his access time with the father for the remainder of August. The mother acknowledged this to be the case.  1) Given the lack of involvement by both of them with the child until 2011, there is little to distinguish either the father or the mother as a better custodial parent. The trial judge found that both parties could adequately provide for the child. 2) There are two important factors which lead the court to the conclusion that it will be in the children's best interests if he is placed in the custody of his mother. This, of course, puts the incentive on the father to perfect his appeal and in that regard, the mother shall serve and file her written argument within 15 days of receipt of the father’s factum (or written argument if the father is seeking custody) and appeal book."
c_1995canlii5671.txt,"The Mother applied to vary the custody provisions of the decree nisis for divorce which provided for joint custody of the parties' 2 children, aged 11 and 9 years. Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had filed an application to vary the judgment by granting sole custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The circumstances were that the mother had been the primary care giver of the children since the separation, the principal residence being with her in the school term and the father in the summer term and he was to have generous access. 2)There was no dispute in that case that the father had, together with his present wife, the day to day care of the boys from their early years onward, except when they were exercising the mother's access. The nature of the relationship between the child and the access parent will always be of importance. The closer the relationship and the more dependent the child is on it for his or her emotional well-being and development, the more likely an injury resulting from the proposed move will be.  3)The father was granted reasonable access. If the motive is simply to frustrate access, it would count in favour of the move. 4)If the move was necessary for the maintenance of employment the move would count as a variation of custody. 5)The distance from the residence was not an issue. The father's reasons for moving to Ontario were not unreasonable if the course he wishes to take was not offered at the dental college of the University of Saskatchewan."
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. The appellants argued that the Chamber judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, which states that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those akin to those before him. They also argued that evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that the Chambers judge should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. Dismissing the application, that the evidence before the Chamber Judge was incomplete and conflicted in some respects, and a comprehensive review of expert opinions was required in the context of all evidence that may come before the court during trial. The Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominates over other issues affecting individual members of a class."

2001skqb485.txt,"The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics. She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics.

The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. There must be a valid objective served by the search.

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for child support purposes is $59,500 gross per annum. In December 2002, Justice Dickson terminated the respondent's obligation to pay support for the parties' oldest child Corry and ordered in addition to ongoing support that the two youngest children, Kristin and Kristin, attend university. In September 2004, the consent court granted a consent order extending the respondent’s s.7 expenses. The respondent accepted responsibility for Brina and the two girls’ postsecondary education costs. 2) In September 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated support for Corry. He found that the parties’ oldest child, Corry, had not paid support for his child and ordered the respondent to pay 66% of the s.8 expenses. 3) The petitioner also requested that the respondent pay his 66% share of the hospital and orthodontic expenses which related to the two oldest children. These expenses related only to the 2005 fall term though she indicated that the computer repairs and equipment were included in their s7 expenses for that year. Accordingly, the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s7 costs. The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred by the petitioner and will assist her in her future plans.

Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore that the warrant should not have issued; that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The evidence was compelling. It was the first piece of evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant but rather than being prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge. 1) The evidence met the standard of reasonableness. The officer did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources. 2) There was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. 3) There were at least three concerns to be addressed: the information was based on a tip originating from outside the police, was that source credible; and the information corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search."

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to ss. 8 and 9. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of Kyle's trial. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1) The accused's Charter application in relation to the cell phone did not associate him with it and entitles him at trial to demand that the Crown prove the phone is his. 2) The essential issue on the firearms and ammunition seized from the accused was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, the loaded Cooey 84 shotgun, and the two over-capacity magazines. 3) Pursuant to the accused's s. 8 Charter rights, the accused can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 4) The Court was unable to accept that a person can't claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in a firearm when, in the context of a wider police investigation, the contents of a gun and ammunition are admissible as evidence."

In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00 for the respondent. Given the respondent's income and the fact that he earns rental income after payment of property taxes, his net rental income yields $8,000 to the petitioner. The respondent is in receipt of CPP benefits of $6,540.00 per annum. HELD: 1)The court does not require the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At the respondent’s age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel the respondent by attributting his income to him more than 40 hours of workweek. At 61 years old, the petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to the provisions OF the Divorces Act nor did she claim for spousals. Nor did she seek spousAL support under the Family Maintenance Act, 1997. 2)The petitioner did file a within application in which she sought interim spielal support of $700.00.  3)The respondent indicated that he intended to work a standard 40 hour week at the rate of $28.50 per hour. This represents an annual income of $59,280. The petitioner also earned rental income from leasing farm land.

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his only child born in 1996. Section of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately preceding the commencement of the proceeding. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the father on an interim basis. 1)The child had no connection of a consequence to Alberta and the Court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Children's Law Act. 2)The father had consented to or acquiesced in the child residing in Saskatchewan and it was clear that the parties were at odds with respect to the child's residence. The respondent did not acquiesce. The child was found to be resident in Saskatchewan for the purposes of the children's law act.  3)The court found that it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction in Saskatchewan as the childclearly had a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta. 4)In the event that there was a change in the petitioner's residence the matter was to be brought back before the Court for review.

After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was charged with impaired driving and impaired driving. Witnesses testified that the defendant lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill in Victoria County, Nova Scotia. The defendant was the lone occupant and had two bottles of beer with him when he left the scene. The police officer testified that he first heard the defendant's s. 10(a) Charter rights being violated and then, at the conclusion of the trial, heard the s. 254(3) rights being infringed and the accused subsequently admitted into the hospital. The accused displayed an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. He even displayed an appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking. HELD: The accused was granted his s. 9(v) Charter right at time when he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and gave an informed waiver as required by law.  1) There is no evidence of a failure to object or a lack of objectivity in the accused's statements and actions during the relevant time period. While his degree of alertness may have fluctuated and his emotions were unstable, the accused nevertheless displayed a reasonable understanding of what was being asked of him and his right to counsel to properly take blood samples. 2) The accused had a blood alcohol content of.32 micrograms per millilitre (b) and lesser amounts of two related chemicals. Alcohol was not the only substance to be found in the sample. Alcohol may have been a factor in determining the legal content of a breathalyzer demand but not in the reasons for the denial of the breath sample and the subsequent waiver by the defence counsel as to whether the accused had asked for the right but it was denied or denied.  3) There was no evidence that the accused drank alcohol in the immediate aftermath of the accident and during the course of the admission into hospital."

He appealed the conviction and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. 3)Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, it was incumbent upon the respondents to move without delay before the stay was granted and after it was lifted on the application of the respondents.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases. The first proposed basis is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences but not the others. There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in a judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise. The second application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. It is indicative that the accused's decision whether to testify would be in the interests of justice. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The other is that the evidence admissible on one count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count. The Crown has given shape to the broad criteria established in s. 591(3) and have identified factors that can be weighed when deciding whether to sever or not. The weighing exercise ensures that a reasonable balance is struck between the risk of prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single trial and that the benefits of justice outweigh the costs."

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants.

HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent and the parties' children were placed in the supervised care of T.B. who was given permission to return to Nova Scotia in 2006. Upon L'M.'s application, an ex parte order issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act prevented the children from leaving Cape Breton until further court hearing. The children's protection history was not disclosed to the Agency until six weeks after the children had moved to Alberta. HELD: 1)The information concerning B.R.W. was simply not germane to the decision made by the Agency. The documents contained historical references only and related, not to, the Agency, to the children's father and to his common law partner.  2)The Agency did not disclose relevant information to the parties or to the court until after the disposition review commenced in November 2006.  3)The agency was responsible for the care of the children, the mother being the primary caregiver and the father being the biological father. The mother was the primary caretaker. She reviewed the files of the parents, the parents and the court. She was unable to identify when the Agency became aware of the protection history, but confirmed that it had been known prior to her coming on board. She confirmed that the mother had a child protection history and that if she knew about the mother's history, she would never have consented to them moving to a new home. The father was not involved at the time of the risk conference.  4)There was no evidence of physical or sexual abuse by either party. The evidence was sufficient to justify the Agency's continued involvement with the children. It was not necessary for the Agency to justify its continued involvement. 5)There were significant concerns about the stability and stability the children were experiencing while they were in Nova Scotia, especially with regard to the protection of the mother. The Agency had failed to disclose these concerns to the parents prior to the commencement of disposition review.  6)Issues regarding access and access by the children included access to the mother, safety concerns, the father's sporadic access and protection history. The parents' relationship with each other, family history of abuse and neglect, lack of supervision by the father and lack of communication with the mother as well as issues concerning the father’s parenting history."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that, on or about August 21, 2003, he did commit a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed summarily. The accused was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court found that the accused’s perception of his relationship with the complainant was that of someone who had been sexually assaulted and that he did not encourage it. Based on the evidence provided by the complainant and the Crown, the accused was found to be in breach of his rights."

The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed.

The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed.  2) Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two children. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that the statements were made with express malice which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. 3)The Court dismissed the application for variation. It held that the facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in preventing a trial in which 'no party wins all parties lose', and the common interest of the people who make such communications. 4)The co-defendants, who had libel and were negligent in the preparation of the reports, were found to be in the best interests of the children."

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff did not have a cause of action against the defendants but that the defendants acted in good faith by insisting on the use of a properly functioning air conditioning cart in the flight. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although the onus is on the plaintiffs, on certification application, to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose causes of action, it is not very high onus. The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no action. The Court should be reluctant to deny a plaintiff his or her day in court. Although the plaintiff would have been ousted in this situation, all allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. There is a remedy for that damage provided for in the Warsaw Convention. The case of Akehurst and Others v. Thomson Holidays Ltd., which involved a claim against commercial passenger airline (Britannia) and package tour operator (Thomson) arising from a crash landing, and an order pursuant to s. 4(2)(b) of The Class Action Act appointing myself as Justice of the Court to hear the certification Application pursuant to section or if the court is satisfied that the express terms of contract as between the tour operator and the plaintiff were not being met. The generous approach to be adopted on this application is to set aside the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor, which has no application to the facts of this case. Although it is common to see a plaintiff plead for damages against a defendant for negligence, breach of contract or unlawful confinement, there is no case law with regard to its predecessor, the Warsaw convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. In this case, the plaintiff submitted that all of the alleged damages alleged by the defendants were the result of actions that he or she had performed within the scope of his employment."

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was dismissed. 2)The childcare costs were necessary and reasonable. The cost of the Childview program, with childcare costs of $7,800 per year, Sylvan learning centre costs at $1,261, income for the father at $37,900 and the mother at $13,085, the mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400 forthwith. 3)The preschool costs and the Learning Centre costs were included in the total cost. 4)The cost of child care was reduced to $472 per month. 5)The Education expenses were reasonable and within the means of the Federal Child Support Guidelines s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child support applications. Although the father was voluntarily providing support to the Mother, at least since February 2007, she was required by the petitioner to bring the motion in order to obtain the appropriate s.expenses. 6)The Court ordered the father to pay his proportionate share of both childcare costs and fees in addition to his s. child support payment, until Sylvan fees were paid in full. 7)The father was to pay retroactive support for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007. 8)The mother's claim for retroactive child support was made pursuant to s.7(1)(d). The father had not made any reasonable efforts to research alternative programming available.  9)There was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered by him.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Creditor's Group. The argument that any monies received by Ag Credit are 'public money' within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act and the Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While it is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life with the potential of continuing to earn interest rather than be placed on deposit with the Court, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily need to be recognized. 3) While there has been some disagreement about the appropriate manner to deal with the surplus, it appears that Empire Life has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim to the surplus by the applicant, Ag Credit, that the surplus is the property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it. 4) The applicant has not shared with the court the legal opinion it was relying on when it made its November 2014 proposal. It is not certain on any of the arguments advanced by the applicants that it paid the costs of the premiums with its own money and thus any overpayment of premiums arising under the contract are its property. Since no other person has a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title, the Interpleader order sought by the insurer is unnecessary.  5) It is important that the Court have the assistance of counsel advancing the case."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. During argument on behalf of the appellant, it was suggested that the trial judge make three errors of law leading to the conviction. One of those errors amounted to an error of law; (i) the trial lawyer referred to photographs of injuries suffered by the complainant when no photographs existed; (b) the learned judge erred in law by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; and (c) there was immaterial whether there were injuries. HELD: The appeal was set aside and a new trial ordered by the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan. 1) The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. His belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 2) There was no miscarriage of justice resulting.  3) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction or to substitute a conviction under s. 686. It would be appropriate to substitute the conviction for a conviction in a case of M. v. W. (D.) which stated that the appellant was unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder because there were bears and insects that could threaten the welfare of the complainant at night."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries she claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall appeared to have been in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the Produce Department. The occupier had reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' and was in receipt of appropriate treatment and supervision. 3)There was no evidence that any of the employees at the store were aware of the plaintiff's slip or that the defendant was in any way involved in it. The logs indicated that floors were regularly cleaned at least once per hour during the early hours of each day. 4)The plaintiff was not required to cross-examine or testify at trial as she was not a party to the sweep log. 5)Statutes filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination were not to be set out in any detail.  6)No adverse inference should be drawn by virtue of the fact the defendant has not filed separate affidavits confirming the injuries sustained. 7)The evidence was that neither the defendant nor any of its employees were aware that the plaintiff had slipped or that they were contributing to the accident."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The mother had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief (which resulted in the birth of the child's fourth child), and for failing to call for help in a timely manner. The defence argued the sentencing judge erred by failing to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. The essential facts were not in dispute. The respondent was only looking after the child for a couple of hours when she was injured and she did not seek immediate help when it was apparent the child was injured. The sentencing judge did not embark on an analysis of the kind set out in Laberge but that authority does not require a judge to explicitly enunciate every factor considered in coming to his conclusion. Both offenders had troubled histories and mental health problems. Both initially denied responsibility, hid evidence and blamed the injuries on another child, as well as her abusive background and her social and economic situation. There were prior acts of physical abuse and neglect by the respondent and these factors led to the conclusion that post-traumatic stress disorder was a mitigating factor. These factors were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The surety was to be responsible for the sum of $1,000. The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture on the basis of the obvious futility of the offence; 2) the accused's disability was not a factor to be considered; and 3) the surety's ability to pay surety should not be limited to the limited time that it would take to appear for trial which is not acceptable in our system of criminal justice. The principles in R. v. Andrews set out the proper principles in relation to the exercise of judicial discretion."

The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.,"An application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision by a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue was whether the Court had discretion to refuse having regard to s. 11(4)(b) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him. The application is accordingly dismissed. 2)The court was of the view that the learned youth court judge failed not to err when he refused to direct the applicant to have counsel. Prior to the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal, the cases had predominantly held that the youth court had no jurisdiction to inquire into the means of the parents. 3)Counsel for the young person argued the judge relied on the Crown's contention that the matters he was facing were uncomplicated and fact-driven in deciding to not appoint counsel."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed.

He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The appellant appealed the City's decision to abandon the expropriation of land which included almost all of the backyard of the appellant for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The appellant argued that the City had disallowed any services that were actually incurred, and that the offer of full compensation for that time had not been made. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the Taxing Master confirmed. 1)The appellant had no liability for any costs associated with the solicitor and client taxation, and the matter was settled. 2)The fact that the appellant had not spent a great deal of time and expense briefing damages before receiving the final medical report in an accident did not render the appellant's offer one of 'full compensation for interest'. 3)The taxing master was entitled to take an overall view and to conclude there were a number of factors mandating the reduction in the solicitor's account."

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice of vacate served on the tenant was set aside. Although one of two joint owners can serve notice to vacate, the section that the Landlord relies upon is only available to periodic Tenancies and Mr. Koch is the sole owner of the property. Even if there wasn’t a lease, the landlord and tenant signed a 3-year lease. The tenant argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit. The landlord appealed; certain circumstances where a landlord’s right of tenancy to a tenant had lapsed, such as breach of trusts, could be found in favour of the landlord. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to the tenant. 2)The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement in good faith. The Hearing Officer did not err in law in finding that neither the landlord nor tenant was acting for the benefit of the tenants. 3)The tenancy agreement was invalid because the tenant failed to provide proper notice of the termination of the lease. 4)The hearing officer did not act in breach of trust. 5)The landlord was estopped from denying the fact of third-party agency under the general law of estoppel, and it is immaterial whether the Hearing officer made an error in law."

The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","Plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was proven on a balance of probabilities. Due to extreme winter weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. The vapours would then be drawn to the pilot light in the furnace where ignition would occur and then flash back to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled. 2)The subsequent recall notice deleted any reference to off-road driving. 3)The plaintiff's expert testimony was accepted. The court found that the plaintiffs had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the cause of the fire was an electric static discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the truck. 4)The court awarded the plaintiffs $50,000 in general damages and $60,000 as interest in the $12,000 judgment for failure to take appropriate steps to remedy the problem and to ensure the continued maintenance of the fuel system."

The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis. The trial judge made the critical findings of fact which negate any attempt to overturn what is on its face a valid contract. The appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors are dismissed."
8_1995canlii4370.txt,"The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council. The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter. At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression. The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The buildings were an eye-sore. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. He repainted the buildings in haphazard and multi-coloured fashion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error in law. The meaning of 'unsightly' in subsection 363(3) must be ascertained by reference to the words associated with it 'a state of disrepair or the accumulation of physical debris' and 2)Any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s.24 of the Charter. The Crown appealed. 3)The learned trial judge, when interpreting s.366(3), made no errors in law, finding that when the legislators turned their minds to the unsightliness of buildings, they drafted subsection 6. The reference to wood shavings, paper, sawdust, dry and inflammable grass or weeds cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings because this category is already dealt with in s.6. If the legislators wished to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection would be necessary."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant argues that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on errors of fact and not on proper interpretation of evidence. 3) There is no other way in which the appellant’s evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. The trial judge attempted to portray himself as someone who was good to the children but was found to be a liar because he said he treated the children well even though he thought he did. The evidence about his involvement with the organization was substantial and material. The court concluded that the trial court misapplied the evidence by failing to give proper effect to it."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff, an American citizen, commenced working for the defendant company in 1952 as an expatriate. He was assigned to various positions in the company, mostly as office manager. In 1983 he was reassigned to another position, this time as regional manager. He went on to work for several years as a regional manager until December 1986. He received a salary of $67,389.95. In 1986 he was given two days written notice of termination without cause. He applied to the Federal Civil Service for a position in the same position, but was refused. He claimed that the offer of compensation from the defendant was conditional upon his conversion to local status. Dismissing the action, that reasonable notice is implied by law and the particular contract was to preserve confidentiality as condition of the employment and was not intended to deal with general terms of employment. The defendant refused to provide 30 days notice to the plaintiff. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice. 2)30 days was not sufficient to abrogate the doctrine of law as reasonable notice must be given. 3)The 30 day notice provision if applied would be harsh term."""
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The agreement provides that the respondent shall pay child support of $741 per month for the support of their two children. The interspousal contract provides that support will be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner seeks to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: 1)The agreement was incorporated into a consent order. It was not feasible to apply Miglin's analysis as there was no basis for it to be applied in the circumstances. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. The respondent was to pay $65 per month in child support. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income that she has earned.  3)This was not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support. There were no circumstances in which it was appropriate to vary an agreement that the parties had relied upon in structuring their affairs on an interim basis. If the court was to order interim spousals support where there was an agreement, it should be cautious not to pre-judge the issue and thereby usurp the role of the trial judge. 4)The parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, child and education. Under the agreement, the respondent received lump sum, ongoing and ongoing support of approximately $5,000 and $1,000 per month. The actual amount of the expenses were estimated at $35,000. 5)The respondent was ordered to pay one half of the net income to the petitioner in the amount of $125,000 by way of equal monthly payments.  6)Costs remained on the table."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code.

Based on the evidence, the Court concluded that the Court had shown that her case was the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew. A curative release would not be contrary to the public interest. The Court provided the following information in support of the application: (i) an Affidavit of the accused; (ii) a discharge summary from the Leipzig Serenity Retreat; (iii) a Prosecutor Information Sheet setting out the circumstances of the offence; (iv) viva voce evidence from the accused and two previous convictions for drinking and driving; (v) the accused had demonstrated good sobriety; (vi) not to have, possess, keep or consume alcohol or enter any licenced premises where the main purpose is the sale or consumption of alcohol;(v) submit on demand a peace officer without reasonable grounds to supply a breath sample in order to determine compliance with this order; and (xi) attend and participate in any personal counselling including psychological or psychiatric treatment as directed by the Probation Officer."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who is now independent of the parties. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and they were divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the parties exchanged financial disclosure and provided the court with their affidavits and financial statements and both counsel were given the opportunity to cross-examine the applicant. The applicant argued that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that the respondent had failed to take advantage of that debt. Application allowed; the respondent's obligation to provide $175,000 per month was reduced to $5,500 per month after the expiry of the support payments; there was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. Both parties were preparing their own agreement in satisfaction of all claims for support, interim support, possession of or title to property or any other claim arising out of the marriage and in assessing whether there has been substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. The Agreement was sound when it was signed and there have been no material changes in the circumstances of either party. However, the respondent did not have access to financial advice prior to signing and he borrowed money from the applicant which was a debt that she voluntarily assumed. The couple had obtained an order varying, rescinding, suspending, suspending or restoring (a) and/or (b) of support in respect of the corollary relief judgment in 2004. In 2005 the applicant applied pursuant to section 17(4)(a) of the Act for variation of the terms of the agreement. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was in substantial compliance. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The agreement was sound and the parties were bound by its objectives.  2)There had been no change in circumstances nor in the manner in which the parties entered into the agreement and therefore the agreement was not unconscionable. 3)The Agreement was based on a reasonable understanding of the circumstances in which each party was bound. The greater the vulnerabilities present at the moment of formation, the more searching the court's review at this stage could not be condoned. 4)There was no breach of any of the obligations under the Act"
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, being in breach of s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to section 4(1) of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark, contrary to s. 553 of the Code. He contended his right to a fair trial had been infringed. Dismissing the application for a stay of proceedings, that the accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his rights to be tried within a reasonable time. As a result of the factors set out in the Charter application, the accused's s. 11(b) rights as guaranteed by s. 7 of the Charter were breached. The reasons for the delay, including the inherent time requirements of the case, such as the time involved in processing the charges, retaining counsel, pre-trial procedures (bail applications, change of venue applications, and adjournments), actions of the Crown, and the Crown in the face of a charge of breaching condition of recognizance, among others, were found to be adverse to the interests of the accused."

When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.",The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was challenged on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend. 2)The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge against the accused. 3)The accused had previously informed his lawyer of the court date. 4)The s7(3) of the Criminal Code provides that the common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in law and new offences.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the Contract between the defendant and the city of Regina.  1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. 2)The single issue of privity was overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached.  3)If the plaintiffs had intended to present the case the contract was the whole arrangement between the city, the Association, the contractor and the truckers, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and city council as well as all the related documents. 4)Once the plaintiffs have constructed their case, they will not focus on the privity of contract. It is incumbent upon them to deal with findings as to damages even though there is no entitlement. The damages claimed by the plaintiffs are excessive and do not properly take into account: Actual operating expenses for the time complained about; net affect of mitigating factors; and reliable calculation of administration of the rotation of work. 5)Each case is dismissed."

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFWC) which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving the applicant. The union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion, the union applied to strike and remove three newspaper articles and a transcript of a radio broadcast. HELD: The relief sought by the Union was granted. The application was dismissed. 1) There was no necessity for their admission. The applicant must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. 2) Wal- Mart's application to strike was dismissed as there was no admissible evidence of interference by the Department of Labour with the application by the applicant and it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that any member actually read the articles. 3) The admissibility of the radio broadcast and its transcript was absolutely not admissible. There was nothing improper about it. 4) The affidavits were admissible by reason of s. 7 of the Saskatchewan Evidence Act. The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al., filed in Saskatoon on May 10, 2006, had no relevance to this Court.  5) The affidavit was not sworn. It must be attached to an affidavit of one Ryan Kraikas who attests that he prepared the transcript. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript and the other two affidavits by one of the union members are admissible as well.  6) The applicant was found not guilty."
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown applies that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, apply the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. 3) As the appellant has grown up and started residing in foster care, it is pertinent to note that he has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. 4) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. In this case, the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. The personal interests are paramount. 5) The Court adopted the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining fitness. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that although the appellant can communicate with his lawyer and assist counsel in his/her defence, the accused must be able to interpret the nature of the proceedings and to appreciate his own best interest. 6) In asking the court to require that the accused be capable of making rational decisions beneficial to him, the court is asking this court to adopt a higher threshold threshold for fitness. The test has clearly been rejected by the courts."

The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;  the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed. HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time. The matter was left to the trial judge.","FIAT. On January 24, 2002, this matter was heard in chambers and the issue was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. The plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another. In his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. HELD: 1)The matter had been heard in January 2002 and was reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs. 2)Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs.  3)Given the representation of the counsel for the plaintiffs over the amount of stress he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time. Accordingly, the matter was left to the trial court to determine its course."

Defence now wants further disclosure of information that relate to those important issues. HELD: Further disclosure is ordered. The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.,"FIAT: The Court must guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions' --speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, however, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. Defence now wants further disclosure of information for the purpose of preparing for and pursuing an inquiry into the facts that relate to those important issues.

5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. The appellant argued that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in his charge. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.  1) The trial judge was of the opinion that counsel for the defence had done most adequately and that it was neither necessary nor desirable that he should repeat the outline of those discrepancies. The evidence of the Crown was that the appellant's cross-examination of the complainant would not have served any useful purpose and might well have so confused the jury as to detract from their efficient discharge of their sworn duty. 2) The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The charge was found to be consistent with R. v. Jacquard.  3) The appellant's point of view was that if the sentence of two years or more was imposed, the appellant would have had no appeal against the order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. 4) The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. While there is a general obligation on the court to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence, this case met that standard. If a sentence of 2 years less a day is imposed, Mr. Almajidi will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute.  In addition to the s. 490.012 of the Code, the Crown applies for s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. This offence occurred in a particular circumstances and there is no indication that the acts of abuse were random nor is there any evidence that compulsive behaviours were involved. The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record. He received fines, driving prohibitions and, in the one case, probation. Because of his intelligence and strength, the accused had not served any period of incarceration other than as related to the present offence."
8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that: 1) a party shall be absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest. The voting agreement secured the follow up steps under the original commitment by Kensington which would be implemented over a lengthy period of time. 2) The words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the Joint venture, and thus to include a whole new term such as 'participating interest' which would substantively and substantively include the word'sociating interest'. 3) The phrase Participating interest in the Program Lands or Project Area does not constitute a sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant. 4) The appeal is dismissed with costs to be taxed."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue is whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. 1) There are four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act as outlined by Baynton J. in Conexus. 2) Before setting out its reasons for whether or not the application should be allowed, it first wants to clarify which materials it has considered. The only materials considered by the court are the statement of claim filed by the applicant, the affidavit affidavit of a defence and counterclaim, and the four pages of an invoice.  3) It is trite law that a plaintiff has a statutory right to garniishee the defendant’s funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for a debt or liquidation demand. But pre- judgment garnishment is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction. 4) There is no reference in the Statement of Claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0% per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement of September 10, 2001. 5) Of more concern to the court is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit as Exhibit C. The affidavit of Shirley Scott appears to confirm the amount of the debt owing by the defendant in the amounts of $24,155.94. 6) The Court has not considered any of the contents of the statements of claim. 7) Although there is a reference to interest in an Operating Agreement in September, 2001 the four page invoice attaches as exhibits a copy of the operating agreement dated September 2010, 59 W.W.R.

5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a variation of the Corollary Relief Judgment in which he alleged that the mother had refused to provide access and communication with his four children. The father had been denied access with his children for multiple sclerosis. He requested that the restrictions on his access with the children be removed from the docket, an assessment by the IWK assessment clinic was agreed upon and the matter was adjourned to March 6, 2007 for a continuation of the settlement conference before Justice Williams. The conciliator met with the father and his children and requested that all restrictions on their access be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior before driving. He also requested that certain roads and highways be closed to allow the assessment team to conduct their own assessment. The assessor found that the evidence showed that the father's medical condition and his use of marijuana did not pose a risk to his children. Therefore, the concerns could be managed if the children continued to have regular access with their father. HELD: The court held that the concerns relating to the father’s medical condition, marijuana use and its possible effect on his driving were not serious concerns and the father was not seeking to alienate his children from him. As long-term treatment marijuana helps alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and its effects on his ability to drive, it was reasonable for the father to take responsibility for some of the circumstances that resulted in the failure of his children to exercise caution and to exercise restraint."

This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and is looking to retire in the next few years. HELD: 1) The respondent will have few lean years until he has paid off the arrearns. He did not have the ability to pay them willingly it had to be snatched away from him.  2) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the respondent to pay child support. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 a month because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity. Now, some 12 years later, he is in the black. It is commonplace for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The respondent's child support obligation under the 2001 order continued even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. It appears that he is trying to reduce his child support obligations. 3) There is no undue hardship to either party. The petitioner had always been a child of the marriage. The 2001 order imputed her income $109,912 and varied accordingly. The s. Guideline amount for this period was $1,493 per month for a total of $107,496 ($1,683 72). 4) On balance of probabilities, the respondent cannot be found to have exceeded the imputed income. The only reason he chose to overpay is because he is seeking to further his career. The Court cannot find that he has not exceeded his means in supporting his children. 5) The father's pattern of non-payment is blameworthy. He has not been complying with any of the many support orders that have issued over the last 25 years and does not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. He does not have an unreasonable desire to lessen his obligation to pay. His family law practice is one of the reasons he chose not to seek employment in the United States or Canada. 6) Applying the criteria set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S., the Court found that the respondent has not shown an unreasonable hardship based on his actual income over the years."

The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant contended that his evidence was totally irrelevant to the charges and worse, that the evidence given by the Crown was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant's credibility. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with or without prejudice to the credibility of the Crown. The evidence raised no issues with respect to the admissibility of evidence, the appropriateness of questions asked of the appellant in cross-examination and the impact these matters may have on the integrity and fairness of the trial; the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and was there sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements. The requisite intent can be framed either way. The trial judge did not enter into a voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay and then you can ask him questions.” The Crown did not pursue the question as it had not established that the sender of the e-mail, who was not counsel at trial, had not de-bugged the email, was not a person who could have elicited any evidence from the recipient of the email and was not prepared to give due consideration to a conditional discharge."

Costs awarded in the amount of $5,000 plus disbursements; although the hearing was less than 2 hours in length, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application, including two days of discovery examination.","There was no tariff that provides direction with respect to the determination of the amount of costs in Chambers' applications. Normal Chambers' application have been awarding costs generally in the range of $250 to $750. In many applications where the results brings finality the court has utilized Tariff A, which takes to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation. In this application Canada Lands sets out that its solicitor and client fees to the date of the hearing amounted to $24,856.50 plus disbursements of $510.97 and the defendant is entitled to judgment for costs and disbursement. The defendant made an offer of settlement in the sum of $5,000, inclusive of costs, which take to be a bid to have it simply goaway due to all the costs of the litigation. However, the sale price of the property which was approximately $2 million,000 was not the appropriate amount for a cause of action and it was very difficult and in fact impossible for the court to really get a handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the defendants were monetarily at risk. The court was left with a decision as to what is a reasonable level of indemnity that the defendants who have been successful on an application that does dispose of the matter before the court."

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes. He denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused, and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one of the victims to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to call this witness. The Crown counsel argued that the defence had not disclosed their intention to use the witness, and that the witness's name was mentioned in the disclosure given to defence. HELD: 1)A stay of proceedings was out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of the witness. 2)The Crown's failure to disclose its intention in making the call should not have prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused's ability to make full answer or defence. 3)The only remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call the witness and have it continue. Staying proceedings was ruled out. The court must take into account the nature of the charge, delay, adjournments, and at who's request the accused may be made at any time after the charge is laid. Compliance must be made by the Crown so that the accused has sufficient time to consider the evidence and the Crown's case before election or plea. 4)The court found that a stay was in order. It would not be appropriate to require another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness in order to be as effective as possible. A lawyer would have had to sit through the entire Crown case and the examination-in-chief should have taken over the case entirely in order be sure to protect the interests of both the accused and the defence."

HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant.

There are too many variables and probabilities. 2)The accused would have had to commence the assault without justification and without the intention to cause grievous bodily harm and he must have used no more force than in the circumstances was necessary to protect himself. 3)There was no casual relationship between the blows of the accused, on my findings of fact, and the broken nose sustained by the complainant."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker contrary to ss. 137 and 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence pursuant to R. v. D.(W.J.), [2005] SCC 78. HELD: A secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and 6 months of community supervision. An additional period of 18 months would allow the time frame required to stabilize and engage with support services prior to his release in the community. 1) The young person did not oppose the Crown's application. 2) A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court had little confidence that this young person would successfully comply with the conditions set out in the YCJA. 3) The aggravating factors were the egregious nature of the assault, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the victim. The harm was intentional and foreseeable and interfered in a substantial way with the physical and psychological integrity, health and well-being of the victims and his family."
9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the previous grounds of appeal. 1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. The assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) Each of the issues raised in this case was dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. Exactly the same reasoning applies here."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review theessment. At the hearing, the Director filed another letter, reducing the assessor's salary to reflect the existence of a public holiday. At issue was whether the City was obliged to pay the employee overtime for hours worked over 32 in a week which had a holiday in it and if so, if so. HELD: The City's application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due orowing to the transit employee. There would be no order as to costs. 1)The legislature intended the rate of pay provision in any agreement to be read and evaluated in the light of the other provisions of the agreement before comparison was made with its counterpart in the Act. The legislature contemplated that it should be left open to demonstrate that a provision (in an agreement) on its face less favourable than its counterpart is more favourable than the latter is evident not only from the wording of the section but from the decision itself to include the second branch of S62(1) in the section. 2)There was no difficulty therefore in concluding that in the circumstances the provisions of this agreement are more favourable to Morgan than those of the Act and that the provisions should govern, and not those of The Act.  3)The City was allowed to apply for a stay of execution pending review of the employer's compliance with s. 72(1)(b) and s. 62(1). 4)Costs were allowed in the amount of $318 to the City. The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, which covers Morgan's employment with the City and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act's pay."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the warrant: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones; a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and a warrant excluded from trial and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine is granted when the trial judge is satisfied that the information obtained from the electronic surveillance was necessary to obtain evidence in respect of offences contrary to s. (trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking), (cultivation), (proceeds of crime) and 19.2 (laundering proceeds) of the Narcotic Control Act and 'any conspiracy, or attempt to commit, or being an accessory after the fact' is a strong directive to that end. 2) Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave. Leave should be left to the exercise of the discretion of the preliminary inquiry judge. Leave must be obtained to conduct cross-examination. Leave to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at preliminary inquiry is an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. 3) There is no reason that a search warrant, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence, should be set aside. The Crown did not do so in this case."
9_2007skqb98.txt,"The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under The Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. The constitutional question is not properly before me. 2)The three bylaws tendered were not to be changed. The zoning bylaw referred to an operation relating to keeping livestock. The amendments to the bylaw addressing the meaning of the word 'hamlet' did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue. 3)The uncertainty suggested by the appellant's arguments on the merits did not exist. Under the current bylaw no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in that district. 4)In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain. The word can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. 5)It is not proper for an appellants to refer to a particular bylaw in a particular sense as a 'districts zoned hamlet' such that to refer only to a specific bylaw, such as a rural municipality, does not refer to such a section. 6)A number of observations were made in relation to the application to admit new evidence. 7)There was no evidence of breaches of the previous bylaw. The bylaw was not defined in the new bylaw nor were there any breaches of previous bylaws. 8)The bylaw does not reference a particular type of livestock. 9)The applicant did not provide any written evidence. 10)The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs does not bear on a decisive issue at trial as it did not mention cattle. 11)The evidence will not be admitted on appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial, as R. v. Palmer (1979), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 and Carriere (2004 SKCA 80) do not exist in the balance of this decision."

In November 1999, the Court issued an order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act. The problem had been with translation services and obtaining a transcript. The mother had been very angry at the father and had taken him outside, placed him on the ground and punched him until friends intervened. This took considerable time to arrange and complete and during this period the child had remained in Nova Scotia. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had to spend considerable time with his mother to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the child would require the Court to consider this as one of the factors to determine custody.  1)The father was to provide the financial and environmental factors; the mother's physical environment did not compare to that of the father; she did not have a permanent residence (a concern of her mothers) nor did she have a steady income (means of support). 2)The mother's wishes for the child to come home were granted.

Applicants to pay costs within 30 days. Applicants' request for leave to argue this motion by phone was refused as it was a substantive motion involving lengthy submissions by counsel.","FIAT. The defendants sought to amend their statement of defence by pleading Accord and Satisfaction. The application was opposed. The trial judge directed the defendants to proceed by notice of motion in chambers and the trial was adjourned. HELD: 1)The amendments proposed raise new and unexpected issues. The applicants can't provide no explanation for their long delay in bringing these matters forward, particularly in light of the allegations in para. 4 and 9 of Ms. Kostiuk's affidavit. 2)If the amendment were granted, it would mark a significant change in the course of the action. In further discoveries, examinations for discoveries and presumably a further pre-trial conference to address the completely new questions raised by the amendments.  3)This application cannot succeed for a variety of reasons. The action extended over four years and was ready for trial on October 25. The amendments raised new and unforeseen issues.  4)It would take a significant amount of time and money to resolve all of the outstanding issues. It would also result, as the respondent's counsel had commented in Roles v. Royal Bank, in a further discovery, examinations, discoveries and a pre- trial conference.  5)There was no explanation as to why counsel did not alert counsel for the respondent at least before the trial and at the very least at a time when the matter could have been adjourned without any additional cost or inconvenience to the parties.  6)The pleading clearly meets the test. The applicant did not raise this new and substantive plea until the opening of the trial, but in the alternative she did. She did raise it in a letter to the effect that the amendments were meant to be a significant and alternative plea to their oft-stated position that they are in no way liable for any breaches of trust. The passage of time can only reflect on their own bona fides in this matter. 7)The application could not succeed because of the numerous issues raised. There were no explanations for the long delay."
8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. They alleged that RBC covered the stock issues of the two companies despite their possession of information about the companies that was not communicated to the plaintiffs. RBC denied responsibility for the delay and asserted that there was no injustice in bearing the consequences of his own fault. They sought damages for breach of a fiduciary duty, breach of trust, and breach of industry regulations and standards, as well as breach of contract, negligence and professional malpractice. Awarding damages for an inordinate delay and for an inexcusable delay. Although the delay is entirely due to the negligence of RBC's solicitor and the plaintiff himself is blameless, it might be unjust to deprive him of the chance of recovering the damages he could otherwise be entitled to. Ruling in the matter, the delay was not excusable. The onus is on RBC to prove that the delay caused by the defendants in not filing their list of documents and their acquiescence to the slow pace of litigation. The Court reviewed and decided three separate appeals simultaneously. The first appeal involved delays of more than three years. The plaintiffs alleged that they should have compelled the defendant's solicitor to attend an examination, while they could not, because they did not have his contact information. The defendant acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation and the matter did not advance for over 20 months. In the second appeal the Court held RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that its conduct was inordinate and caused it serious prejudice. It also failed to properly supervise the solicitor."

The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had applied for interest relief in the amount of $565.00. Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. Relief was granted. The Bankrupt had 13 years of student loans outstanding. The proposal was made by the Government of Nova Scotia through the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations Debtor Assistance. She was advised by her debt counsellor that it would be an effective way of satisfying her student loans. After completing the proposal, she learned that this advice was not correct. The balances owing on the student loans remained outstanding. She applied for the order that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loan applications. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)It was difficult for the Court to find a way to require the Bankubrie to pay a significant portion of the debt, say half of it, which would be a continuation of financial difficulty that prevented her from paying the loans. Any period longer would be too long. It would also protract the burden of these loans in manner inconsistent with the overall objectives of the BIA. 2)If the Bankuberie could have been found to have acted with good faith, the Court would have no difficulty in requiring her to pay this portion of her debt. This, however, was not open to her.  3)The Bankubry had acted with a good faith attitude. It was understandable in the early years that she did not have permanent employment, she was unable to service the loans, and it would require several years on top of the already 13 years she had been burdened with them.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issue is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. HELD: 1) There is no need for the Crown to provide hard copies of any documents created on paper and scanned into the computer unless the document 'has been, or will be, utilized by the police or the Crown in hard copy' (R. v. Laporte). 2) In this case, the nature and format of disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the accused's right to make full answer/defence. This appears to be a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. 3) The use of hard copies for trial preparation that is sought by the defence is reasonable. The Crown has stated that it will continue following such process. 4) The issue of the usable format is whether the Crown should provide hard copy of any of the police officers' notebooks dealing with their trial testimony. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed in the affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence through the electronic disclosure. The choice is theirs, so long as the disclosure is reasonably accessible. 5) The Crown requested hard copy copies of the officer's notebooks in full, in chronological order that postdates the laying of charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. It was ordered that the notes of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in a hard copy in such a fashion as to be relevant to the trial fairness issue.  6) It is appropriate to provide some basic information regarding the nature of the disclosure provided so far."

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. HELD: The Court found that given the accused’s record and the fact that he had 58 Criminal Code convictions, the offence of assault with a weapon carries a maximum penalty of 10 years and the application must be satisfied that the offence is a serious personal injury offence, which is prerequisite to ordering an assessment. This would appear to be a burden far less than the criminal burden of proof and even less than that of a civil liability of proof. However, the accused had a lengthy and related criminal record. The offences were violent and the accused displayed extreme indifference to his fellow officers."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor for the police to take any statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. This additional informational requirement on police ensures that detainee who persists in wanting to waive the right to counsel will know what it is that he is actually giving up. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper but the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s s. 8 Charter rights by failing to explicitly warn the police of the obligation to provide unequivocal advice to the accused once he has changed his mind about seeking legal advice. 2) The respondent had not explicitly indicated that he would like to contact a lawyer. The Crown did not raise this issue with the learned judge. On appeal, the Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent, after first asserting his rights to counsel, waived that right. 3) The holding-off requirement was not required in this case. The trial judge concluded such warning was required in all of the circumstances. 4) The Crown provided unequivocal counsel to the respondent on the issue of the waiver of his right to consult with a lawyer once the phone room was full of officers and the obligation on the part of the police during this time to refrain from having them participate in the process that would incriminate him. 5) On appeal of the conviction the Crown sought to attach an additional informational obligation on police that would require them to disclose the name of the lawyer they had referred to in Prosper to ensure that the detainee knew what it was that he was saying. 6) The failure of the Crown to disclose such information to the appellant was unequivocal and unequivocal. The appellant was given an unequivocal waiver by the Crown that the Crown must not turn into an obligation on detainees to seek the advice of a lawyer Once the lawyer changed mind"

The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. Although the accused had apologized to the complainant and apologized to his mother, there was nothing from any of the witnesses who testified that undermines credibility. The complainant had initiated the physical aggression by hitting the accused on the shoulder in frustration at how matters had unfolded to which he reacted with a blow. None of that scenario supported the Crown being able to prove that the complainant had not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred. The accused must receive the benefit of the doubt in that regard."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the person named in the registration certificate pertaining to the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The Court held that ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of a registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership."

The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner access to the family home and supervised access only for the respondent father. The Court held that the evidence suggested that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it not in the best interests of the children and that their father had only supervised access to them. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, and that there was no basis to the allegations of fear. Therefore, the Court concluded that the allegations were unreliable and that it would not be in the children's best interests to allow the respondent to continue to reside in the home with the assistance of a supervised access order. Regarding the respondent’s allegations that he was a stay-at-home dad, the court found that they did not have a risk of harm based upon the fact that the allegation was made against him and that he had been significantly involved in the care of their children. The court concluded that increased contact between the parties would in fact be beneficial to the children."

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment.

There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties were divorced by order dated December 21, 1995. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. HELD: 1)The respondent was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the monthly support he had paid at the suggested guideline figure. 2)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asked for was fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty as to the respondent's future job and income. 3)There was no evidence as to what the petitioner would require if she did go to a university this fall. 4)It was premature on the application to change the amount of spouse maintenance that the applicant had asked for at the proposed guideline figure because there were too numerous unknown factors including the future position of either parties."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","Applicants, Peter Boone and Loren Bough, seek to convert some $2.5 million of debentures issued by the respondent to Medusa Medical Technologies Inc. (MEDusa) into an action. Boone and Bough are taking steps to attempt to secure payment of their debenteures by means of an application to this Court. Medusa has commenced a separate action for damages against them. At issue is whether the respondent can quickly ascertain who their important witnesses will be; if so, what information will be served by the Respondent and Medusa. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(3) provides a presumption in favour of a proceeding if the presumptions in favour are not met. In this case, the Debentures have matured and the respondent has not been paid. 2) There can be no question that an action as intended by Medusa will significantly increase the time it will take to bring an action to trial and the erosion will be significantly lessened if the dispute is resolved by application. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the enforcement application. 3) The Court reviewed all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to me and the able and helpful submissions by the parties and was not satisfied that the initial application of the respondent should be converted to an action at this time.  4) In an effort to secure repayment of the debts owing to them, the respondent commenced separate action against the respondent, Medusa, alleging breach of contract and resulting economic losses.  5) Each party shall have their costs on this motion on a party and party basis."

7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs claim. In February 2012 counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, advised the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. More than 2 months have gone by since the affidavit of Marilee Fehr was provided to the plaintiffs.

The Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs on September 5, 2012, that the Court accept Ms. Fehr's affidavit.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She engaged the services of the defendant Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year, the plaintiff sold the property to the defendants. She claimed aggravated damages against them both in information given to her which induced her to purchase the home and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The defendants failed to tell her the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. Water entered through a dormer window with rotting casing. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She alleged that Mui and her husband were negligent in misrepresenting facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of them. HELD: Damages were claimed against all defendants.  1) The plaintiff was given a building permit from the Rural Municipality of Corman Park. It was only then that she realized that the building permit issued by the Municipality had been revoked. 2) There was no discussion about home inspection. The search for suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. The realtor was a friend of the plaintiff. She had visited the plaintiff's home several times and had not been able to help but notice cracks. She assumed that the cracks were caused by the defendant's use of the home as a rental home. She was wrong. The evidence from the architect was accepted. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext."

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation. STC awarded damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two, rather than five or even ten. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and so on. Finally, the plaintiff contended that the $12,000 severance payment should not have been attributed to him for the purpose of mitigation as he had been in the employ of the Crown in the right of the Province for a decade and had met his legal duty to mitigate but had not succeeded in reducing his loss. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge made no error in the facts. The severance terms of the contract were arrived at as a whole, subject to the fact the plaintiff had been employed by STC for a salary of $110,000, that he was entitled at common law to 18 months notice of termination having regard for his earlier service and the fact he had met that duty but had failed to reduce his loss accordingly. 2)Mitigation was not allowed on appeal."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review.

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.

The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether any injuries sustained were not minor injuries.

However, it was not the function of the Court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them.

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. At trial, the Crown argued that s. 19(3) contravenes the guarantees contained in s. 11(d) and s. 12 of the Charter. The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to the Crown's submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S. 20(4).

The interest in the property of a person who has neither been convicted nor charged with the offence will not be affected if the person 'appears innocent of any wrongdoing' in the offence of which the property is forfeited. 3)Competition and unusual treatment by the court can only result in punishment and punishment. The test for determining whether any punishment is grossly disproportionate to the offence is very properly stringent and demanding. A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter because forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. 4)The applicant must satisfy the judge hearing the application that not only does she have an interest in property, but also in the blue tubs stacked one on top of each other in the trunk of the Lincoln. The judge must consider whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose. 5)It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions. The court was aware of the fact that she was the owner of the motor vehicle and there was no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the testimony of Constable Baulkham."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of $2,000 payable by the father to the mother.  1) The evidence was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding that the child had not withdrawn. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order. 2) The father did not have an ongoing obligation to provide support. The child's future ability to 'withdraw from parental charge' was unknown. 3) There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the respondent be paid all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. Allowing the application on all fours, that the applicant's contention that this creates the degree of governmental control to warrant the application was untenable. In cases involving arrests, detentions, searches and the like, to apply the Charter to purely private action would be tantamount to setting up an alternative tort system. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. Sadly, the petitioner, Megan Wolfe, died of cancer in January 2015. The third party takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. HELD: There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of the Children’�s Law Act, 1997 and it is equally applicable when a family member pursues custody. 1) It is not disputed that the mother and father commenced a cohabitating relationship in 2005 when the mother was 18 and she was 25 years old. However, there are concerns regarding the father”s use of alcohol and drugs. The parties agreed in 2009 that the father would have access with the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. He was granted supervised access. 2) The grandmother was found to be person sufficient interest in relation to the issues. There was no evidence that her access to the children was sporadic prior to the death of Megan Wolfe. The evidence from the parties’ prior settlement conference was considered sufficient to warrant an order for supervised access by the grandmother.  3) There were no grounds to grant a finding of sufficiency in the evidence as to whether the grandmother met the objectives of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. The proper focus of an inquiry is to determine whether the applicant can show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the child. In this case, it was the grandmother who met the requirements of the Act by virtue of the fact that she was the primary caregiver for the children. 4) There is no evidence of the father having reasonable and liberal access. It is clear that the grandmother has a blood tie to his children. She is willing to provide him with parenting time with them."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the respondent's benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The respondent claimed that the benefits were terminated because the respondent was not able to perform some of his farm duties and because he was unable to pay his partial income replacement benefit. The applicant applied to the Court for an order setting aside such termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefit on the basis that the respondent had not properly prepared his benefits in accordance with s.129(1)(e) of the Act. SGI shall therefore pay the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the respondent for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the September 24 date to the date of the applicant's commencement of employment in Alberta.

The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

Allowing the application, that the learned Chambers judge erred in law when he ruled contrary to the law prohibiting champerty and maintenance in proceeding S.H. No. 102390. The appellants wished to add as ground that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not alawful plaintiff and, therefore, not entitled to security for cost.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he did not own a computer at the time he engaged in the activity, but stated that he had enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in 2005 in Latin course. He used a computer in capacity, that involves being in position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years, and being in a computer system within the meaning of s. 342.1 of the Code for the purpose of communicating with people of that age group. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order of finding in s. 487.051 which authorizes the taking of samples from you for forensic DNA analysis. 1)The defendant did not have a criminal record. He abided by his release conditions over the past 2 and half years, had no previous criminal record, and was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lived on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. 2)There were no mitigating factors referred to in the pre-sentence report. A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentenceon the facts in this matter, although the defendant qualifies for the same to the extent a fit sentenced would not exceed 2 years. The limited information available could suggest that he would not endanger the community if one were imposed."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summons to the defendant in an action for breach of contract. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. In the interim, the defendant responded to an Interim Ruling by letter of his solicitor dated August 15, 2011. The letter complained about the speed at which the matter was being considered and showed a lack of understanding of some of the basic principles and procedures in Small Claims Court. At issue was whether or not the claims should be issued. HELD: The court declined to issue the summons. A return date of the Notice contemplated in paragraph 10 of the decision was set in consultation with the office of the proposed plaintiff’s solicitor. The return date would allow the plaintiff to argue the issues. The issues raised by these claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in the Court of Queen’S Bench, must be done in the manner set out in the Small Claims Act."

He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of child support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. The amount of the $2,292.58 that the respondent had brought into the marriage was $3,000, which was 33 per cent of his present income. The Court ordered the respondent to pay $1,700 by monthly payments of $500 and $508 by way of Canada Pension Plan Benefits. In the alternative the respondent should receive half of his income from his property and $10,000 from his taxes. The balance of $6,000 should be paid to the petitioner with monthly payments in the amount of $5,000. The remaining monies should be divided among the petitioner and children."

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The petitioner alleges that because he is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of the child.  2) The respondent demonstrated that he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to this child. The relationship spanned the years 2000 to 2007, commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over those years, the relationship between the petitioner and the respondent spanned when the respondent was living with the petitioner's mother and her two older half-siblings. It is pertinent to note that the respondent's criminal record acquired during the time they lived together speaks for itself. However, it is not enough to conclude that access to the respondent is in the children's best interests. 3) In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the court should consider a variety of factors including, but not necessarily limited to: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, (b) the duration of that involvement, (c) how the relationship with the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially."

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the video evidence and the testimony of corrections officers, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused”s position in the trial was based on the concept of “parties to the offence”, “principal offender” and secondary offender. The three elements of s. 34(2) have both subjective and objective components: (1) the accused reasonably believed that he was assaulted; (2) that he caused the death or grievous bodily harm to Dorion; (3) that his group moved in unison with the purpose of attacking him; and (4) that there was a mental element which allowed the accused to believe that he had been assaulted. The Crown had established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the accused as a consequence to the plot to which he was a party. The court reviewed the various alleged acts and concluded that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s.34(2)."
c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)There was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused's evidence of the accused. The officer testified that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece of his vehicle. He said he waited for the ready light to come on. He got an imbalance signal from the machine. He stopped the test and blew three times in all. 3)The accused did not provide adequate instructions to the officer as to what to do with the sample or how to provide the sample. There was no adequate instruction on how to do this on a breathalyser or in any manner that the officer could provide the adequate instructions on what form the sample should be provided on an adequate day. 4)It was possible for the accused to have reasonable excuse to refuse the breath sample on the second and third tests. The only reason he could not comply with the demand was because he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District and had no duties. The police vehicle approached from the rear and had to engage its emergency lights. The vehicle swerved to the right-hand side of the highway more than necessary as he approached it. He approached the vehicle once the officer engaged his emergency lights and his emergency breathing apparatus. He did not disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. 5)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. The Court accepted the accused' evidence of refusal where there is a discrepancy. The court accepted the officer's testimony of blowing in excess of 3.5 litres of alcohol the whole night. The last call came when they were at the pines just north of Prince Albert. He explained to the accused that he needed a steady breath and that his lips had to be sealed over the mouth piece.

5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The time periods for each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact."
