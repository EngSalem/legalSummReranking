d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two young complainants were living with their mother. He denied assaulting the complainants, but was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for the assault on the 14-year-old when she was between 14 and 17 and on 1 month consecutive sentence for the second count which was 1 year consecutive. The complainants had made a complaint to the police, who arrested the appellant after they left home. He was employed full-time and was not a user of drugs or alcohol. Shortly after the girls left home their mother moved in with the husband. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence, which resulted in a substantial breach of the complainant's evidence. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony. After carefully reviewing the evidence we cannot say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence; the appeal is dismissed."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found by trial judge based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(a) and to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The plaintiff sought to have the action heard in Nova Scotia. The defendant, SEDCO, argued that the attachment order was an intrusive pre-trial remedy and that its existence would hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations. SEDEO argued that it did not establish that the plaintiff attempted to frustrate justice or that there were other good reasons for termination. The court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.SEDCO had relied upon the assignment agreement simpliciter as supporting the existence of the ground of attachment set out in Rule 44.(1)(e). The trial judge, finding that SEDco had not shown any principled basis to justify the maintenance of the order, found that the affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim, and the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The defendants had not established any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. HELD: The attachment order must be terminated.  1)Sedco had established conduct on the part of the plaintiff that would hinder the plaintiff's ability to resume and expand its business. While Sierra has asked the court to pierce the corporate shroud and regard the plaintiff and the plaintiff as being intertwined, the plaintiff has shown no principled basis for that. The mere allegation that a connection with the individual or corporate defendants is not sufficient grounds to justify an attachment ordered. 2)SEDEO had not proven any of any of its grounds for termination under Rule 44(1)(b). The mere allegations of a link between the defendant and corporate defendant was not enough reason to justify such an order.  3)The plaintiff did not demonstrate any principled reason to terminate the order. The affidavit of the defendant's president, who was at the time of the action, relied on statements from Sterling Farm's president. There must be evidence of such conduct, not mere suspicion, in order to justify a attachment order. If the effect of the assignment is to hinder or delay creditors, an intention to hinder/ delay is apparent and will be presumed. 4)SINGLE: The plaintiff failed to establish any of four grounds for the attachment ordered pursuant to rule 44.01(1) and Rule 44"
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The evidence at trial indicated that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligramrams, respectively. At 2:54 a.m., the accused provided a sample into an Alcotest 7410 GLC. The result was an 'F' indicating that the accused had blood alcohol levels of at least 100 milligrrams. The accused was transported back to the detachment where she was turned over to a qualified technician. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol content. It indicated that both the first and third sample were taken within the prescribed time period. The technician testified that she saw the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' and testified that the technician wrote the figure 3 in overtop of the '3'. There was also an initialled change to the year from 19 to 2003. HELD: The accused's charge was dismissed. 1)It is not appropriate to comment upon the issues raised with respect to the certificate. 2)The accused's argument that there was insufficient evidence to advance it to the level of an approved instrument was not supported by the evidence at issue. There was no evidence that she was qualified to make this argument. The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. 3)There was insufficient circumstantial evidence that this was the only evidence that could be advanced to advance the argument that the approved instrument could not be identified on the basis of the three models designated in the certificate as approved by the Crown. There is insufficient evidence that the Crown could rely upon any of the models designated for the purposes of identifying the accused. 4)The certificate could not adequately be identified. The model did not advance the arguments that it was not sufficiently designated to do so. 5)The Court noted that there had been no expert evidence designated for this purpose."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent’s Line 150 income for child support purposes was $112,871. There was nothing in the evidence before the court that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis.  2) The company in issue was in its startup phase and there was insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without impeding the ongoing operation of the company. 3) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be costs in the cause."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","The landlord appealed an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The landlord appealed, arguing that the order was arbitrary and unreasonably unreasonable. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner; in fact, the reasons for withholding consent are neither arbitrary or unreasonable; the factors leading to the decision are not random or based on purely personal whim; an unreasonable one would have no credible rationale behind it; and in the unique circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary the May 2002 child support order on the basis that his income had decreased as a result of being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing the layoff was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage and that she had no obligation to contribute to the child's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1) The husband's obligation to pay child support of $534 per month for both children and $60 for the son's hockey, golf and baseball expenses was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 2) The wife's position warranted an assessment of costs. 3) The father's income had increased since the May 2, 2002 consent judgment. The unreasonableness of the wife warrants an assessment. 4) The parties' eldest child had been unemployed for over 2 weeks with vague knowledge of when he would be rehired. The school year began in May 2002 and the child was in full-time attendance at a post-secondary institution by the end of March 2003. 5) The respondent's s.7 expenses (hockey, golf, baseball and soccer) were increased. 6) The applicant's income for child support purposes was $37,416. 7) The court found that the wife ceased to be an 'child of themarriage' within the Meaning of the Act effective March 2003 because of the husband's continued absence from work and the wife's failure to terminate the husband’s contribution for his hockey, soccer and baseball expense."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The test on such an application requires there exist question of Law or question concerning the jurisdiction of the Board, doubt whether the Committee's decision is correct, or there is a broad importance as to warrant the attention of the Court. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply an adjustment to size. At issue are the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. HELD: Leave to appeal the matter is denied. 1) The issue of the aggregation of the MAF neighbourhoods merits consideration. The Assessor had determined the specific Maf neighbourhoods based on industrial property sales. However, the Assessors worked on the basis of aggregated sales from different MAF neighborhoods. The factor of economic obsolescences is considered when the Assent determines the Maf for each neighbourhood. The MAF in a given neighbourhood might capture all of the economic factors but not some of the abnormal economic obsolescentence such that the normal economic and financial obsolescENCE could be a significant factor. 2) There is no evidence that the Committee made any error. The Committee did not err in failing to consider the 'comparable unit method' pursuant to Document 4.1.5 of The Urban Municipality Act and the Manual. 3) Leave is granted on the issue of valuation on a unit basis and on a business or service basis. Leave to appeals on this ground is denied on the grounds the sale was impugned. Further on perusal of the record, the purchaser was fully aware the sale had been a portfolio sale, had contacted both the vendor and the purchaser, and provided particulars of the sales verification form as part of the evidence to the Board. Leave is denied in part for two grounds: the use invalid sales, and the allegation that the Assondition erred by failing to use a comparable unit method of analysis in determining whether an adjustment for obsolescencia for size should be applied to the owner's property; and 4) Leave for appeal is granted for costs on the second ground."
b_1995canlii3936.txt,"The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property. A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. He took a truck from the parking lot of a residence and escaped custody. He and the other young offender, who had been in breach of probation, accelerated away and struck the side of an attached garage.

HELD: The disposition of the disposition was set aside and 1 year secure custody, concurrent to the 9 month open custody sentence, substituted. 1)The young offender had been involved in a series of offences since his first set of charges were first committed. Since the first two offences, he had been convicted of sexual assault, five counts of sexual abuse, five count of theft or possession of stolen property and four counts of failure to comply or to appear. 2)The accused was 18 at the time of this appeal."

HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. After being pulled back into the store by the clerk, an altercation occurred between the clerk and the appellant. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal is allowed and a sentence of 1 year incarceration is imposed along with a 10 year section100 order. 1)The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as 'technically a robbery' and the appeal against conviction was therefore dismissed. 2)It was appropriate to allow the appeal and to reduce the sentence to one year incarceration with a ten-year section 100 order from the sentence imposed on the sentence of one year imprisonment."
c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance from the respondent husband. The parties were married for four years and had just purchased a home in Nova Scotia. The husband had recently moved away and was unable to access his property. The wife argued that the value of the assets retained by the wife exceeded those retained by him. Application to admit fresh evidence dismissed; the evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both; the judge found no palpable or overriding error in the facts. The evidence met the test for admission of fresh evidence on appeal and the judge made certain factual findings that supported his conclusion that the judge committed no reversible error."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","In dealing with the second application, the petitioner sought to vary the child support order granted by the court in 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wished to also live with her mother or live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. As no material change was demonstrated, this application must be dismissed."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff for seeding 1,050 acres. The plaintiff refused to allow the defendant's lawyer to refer to exhibit P-5 of the contract, arguing that it was not a matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. The defendant sued for the price of the custom seed and sought leave to appeal. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant. The court reviewed the transcript of the trial judge's cross-examination of the plaintiff and found that it did not relate to an error in the law. 2)The trial judge made no error in weighing the central issue of law with respect to the issue of costs. The central issue was whether the plaintiff could have seeded all but 70-100 acres of the tract of land shown in the contract plus the balance of the Knudsen property. 3)Leave was granted to appeal on the principle that the Small Claims Act may not be invoked on a question of law basis. 4)Leave must not be obtained in the interest of expediency."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Marketing Council applied to have the affidavits of the applicant's manager and two others struck out as an attempt to put evidence before the court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council. The Attorney General had previously asked the Board to hold a'show cause' hearing pursuant to section 10 of the Natural Products Marketing Act. The Board requested the hearing be adjourned and the hearing then was held as scheduled, without the participation of the Board, with the result that the Merks license was not suspended. The applicant appealed. HELD: The application was dismissed. The affidavits were not admissible.  1)The affidavits honoured. 2)There must be a real dispute. The fact that there was an ongoing and clear dispute between the parties and the fact that the applicant had made the decision that the license had been contravened and that their license should be suspended gave it more credibility and credence than the usual admissible evidence. The marketing board's application was denied on the ground of an error in law. The affidavit evidence was admissible, but not as admissible as the evidence raised by the parties on the application. 3)The applicant failed to meet the burden of proof required of proof by law and failed to comply with the provisions of the Trade Union Act. 4)It was argued that affidavit evidence is only admissible on an application for certiorari if the record is incomplete. 5)There was no evidence of the parties' differing positions on issues not in the Record. 6)The court was unable to determine the relevance and general propriety of the drafting of affidavits and evidentiary issues of the nature raised in Waverley (Village Commissioners) and (Minister of Municipal Affairs) 1993 CanLII 3403 (NSSC)."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misstatement. It claimed that the defendant negligently estimated the quantities of coal to be handled under the contract and, as a result, induced the plaintiff to enter a contract from which it was unable to derive anticipated profits and from which the plaintiff incurred start up costs and operating losses. Defendant awarded the plaintiff $270,307.05 in damages. The plaintiff appealed on the basis that the judge did not make any reviewable error with respect to the facts. Appeal dismissed; plaintiff awarded nothing to plaintiff; defendant awarded $10,000 in damages for loss of profits. Although the plaintiff's claim had been raised and it was clear that the plaintiff was not entitled to reimbursement for the money it expended in securing alternative performance through renting equipment and hiring others to do the work, the plaintiff failed to establish that the representation the tonnages were based on the latest information was untrue and there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff in the breach claim."

The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to remove an executorof an estate both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. While there is dissension or disagreement between the executors and executors, this does not prevent them from taking steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Will. In this case, the respondent was removed as an executrix. 2) The application seeking a revocation is based upon the grounds that: i. by challenging the validity of the Will; ii. by taking steps in a solemn form; or iii. by selling and transferring title of assets to the deceased's grandchildren. There is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly administer.  4) Having before this Court an application seeking revocation of a grant of proate, and an ordered that the will be proven IN solemn form, it is incumbent on the executor to act promptly in respect of his application, should he decide to proceed with that application. An understanding of such differences is not necessary for the determinations made."

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana after a large quantity of marijuana was seized from their property.

They appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The appeal should be allowed and a fresh trial ordered. In this case, the court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v. United States (1967), 389 U.S. 347, and found that there was no breach of the respondents' rights based on the unreasonable search and seizure of the evidence. In fact, the evidence obtained as a result of the seizure was tainted and may be admissible if its admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers, who were in attendance at the residence as a result of a fire, were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence had admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that it was too late to amend, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove the date of possession of the weapons. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they do not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do Not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage.

In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action.

The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to diligently proceed with its action.

However, the plaintiff did not establish that the delay was excusable.  2) There was no evidence of the delay beyond the time the plaintiff had taken to prepare the undertakings. 3) The respondent has not provided any legally acceptable excuse for the inordinate delay which has occurred in the course of the action. 4) It is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim. All parties are cautioned to now proceed diligently and without delay. 5) The application for an order returning the $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid is not granted.  6) The Court reviewed all the relevant facts and noted that no legally acceptable excuses had been advanced for the delay which had occurred in this case. 7) It was in the interest of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered in the cause. 8) The onus is on the trial judge to determine whether or not the application should be granted.

5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.",The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded.08. The police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused was seated in the driver's seat. The headlights of the vehicle were on and the ambulance attendance and police officers arrived within minutes. The accused made no further requests or requests to speak to anyone. At issue was whether the accused's right to counsel was infringed pursuant to ss. 254(3)(b) and 258(1)(a). HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1) The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was incapable of providing a sample of his breath or that he was in any condition to provide it. The evidence established he was coherent and understood right to the action. He spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. There was no suggestion that the accused had any other issues. 2) The court found that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. He wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 3) The Court held that it was immaterial to conclude the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 4) There were no other grounds to exclude the Certificate of Analysis which clearly supported the conclusion the accused would not be able to provide a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254 (3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Superintendent objects on this taxation indicating that this court should review the trustee's fee given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment. The fee is taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount and the excess monies should be distributed to the creditor's who should be advised that their original debts remain receivable. HELD: 1)The fee should only be based on monies sent from the creditor while the proposal had been extant. 2)PWC as agent was not responsible to disburse those monies to the creditors as was the intention of the debtor. 3)The court had no discretion in either the trustee or the court to relieve against the annulation."

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the Act provides that an annuitant with a pension entitlement can participate in a Group Plan under any circumstances. Section 146(12) provides that upon a termination of employment an applicant's account is to remain with the insurer and the proceeds of the account are to be used to purchase a pension refund.  2)The provisions of s. 146(3) and s.57 of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. 3)The applicant had not retired and no pension refund existed. The provisions of the Plan Contract and the provisions of S. 146/2(c.4) of The Personal Property security Act had not been applied to her. 4)The application for a declaration that the provision of the s.146(2) and (c)law relating to transfers of interest to third parties was dismissed. 5)Nothing in the Plan contract or the Income tax Act prohibits the applicant from pledging her interest. Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired, there appears to be a nomonetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless aproper request for a transfer has been made by her.  6)The legal effect of the loan agreement is similar to the security arrangements discussed in McMahon v.

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003 and agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the respondent. The respondent seeks to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and is opposed to the relocation of the petitioner to Edmonton. The issues on the relocation are whether it is in the best interests of the baby to relocate to Edmonton, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child, and what is a reasonable time and place for the respondent to have the child in Edmonton. HELD: 1) The respondent is to have primary residence with the petitioner. The Court reviewed the factual background in these decisions and found that the respondent's reasons for relocating are only relevant in exceptional circumstances where it impacts on the parent's ability to meet the child's needs. 2) The petitioner has lost an active co-parent and the child will no longer benefit from his co- parenting. The child will lose contact with his extended family in Edmonton as Charlene's plans for the children's care in Edmonton are vague. 3) The applicant's application to move the child to Edmonton has significant consequences. It is not in the childrens best interests to allow the petitioner's relocation to Edmonton with the assistance of a third party. The parties have filed their respective income information and will make the requisite child support order based on that evidence. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances in Gordon v. Goertz and concluded that supervised access is no longer required. 5) The evidence on the respondent having access with the baby in Edmonton is ample. 6) Based on the loss of Harley as an active parent coupled with the vague and uncertain plans for their child's future, the Court found it was in the respondent’s best interest to relocate the child with the intention of having the child live with him for extended periods of time. The applicant would lose the psychological bond between the petitioner and her child. 7) The access schedule is appropriate for a child residing with him in Edmonton, with the exception of one weekend a month. 8) There was ample evidence that the risk of the respondent experiencing a grand mal seizure would be minimal if the petitioner were allowed to relocate. The evidence also showed that the petitioner would be able to have contact with her immediate family in Alberta. 9) The Court concluded that there was ample empirical evidence that would support the conclusion that the psychological connection between the respondent and child remains significant. 10) The application to grant access to the respondent was dismissed. 11) The"

The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother. The Department had been very much involved and had previously provided support to the foster parents. The mother had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had been placed on medication. She had also been diagnosed with domestic disharmony and was prone to drinking. The father, who was in good health and had the protection of a parent aide, decided after a day or two to go back to the home and leave the children in the care of the Minister. The child's mother was not able or unwilling to take action to protect the children and the evidence showed that the mother was in denial of this or to excuse it. For the first time since the birth of the oldest child, who had been drinking, the Department had taken steps to have the children removed from the home. A Department official had attended the home but could not persuade the mother to attend. HELD: The Department was ordered to permanently commit the children to the mother. 1)The mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children. The children were to be adopted by a family of three. 2)The evidence from the previous two children who had not been properly supervised and protected provided that adequate parenting must be found for the children 3)The foster parents were incapable of doing things with respect to the children 4)The father was physically abused and continues to be in denial. The evidence also satisfies that the children's exposure to domestic violence and disharmon may have harmed and would further harm the children emotionally. 3)There was no evidence that either of the parents could or would manage to change within six months or year or ever, to the point where the children could safely be returned to or L.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The evidence from the child protection worker was that the mother was mentally ill and abusive to the children and that the father should be made aware that she had custody of the children. The mother was to have access on his scheduled days off work. The audio recordings were inadmissible unless their authenticity was established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record, and the voices have been properly identified. The tapes had the opposite effect of speaking volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother's."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","This was an application by the petitioners for an order to have the respondent, the Registrar in Bankruptcy, granted an ex parte order directing him to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities), previously owned by the petitioner, and purportedly'seized' by the respondent pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour. The petitioner had filed notice of disputing the order in Bank bankruptcy court. HELD: The respondent was ordered to submit to cross-examination on his affidavit and notice disputing a petition. 1)The petitioner had committed three acts of bankruptcy within six months prior to the filing of the petition. 2)He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they became due. 3)He owed nothing to the petitioner for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. 4)No extenuating circumstances were required to warrant the granting of the receiving order."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that Turcotte J. had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order for retroactive child support and that the trial judge had not erred by misapprehending the facts or by failing to find unreasonable delay. In the context of family support orders, the court held that the parties had agreed in Frey that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order. In this case, the Court found that the respondent had exceeded his means by varying the 2011 variation order and that it was in conflict with the consent order of the Court of Queen's Bench in that it held that a final order could be varied."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the decision of the trial judge in relation to custody and access. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car contrary to ss. 430(4) of the Code. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court agreed with the procedure and the evidence was applied over to the other information at the close of the trial.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad, there is no doubt that the actions of the accused were aggressive. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help and then rushed up the stairs toward the trailer. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he thought he was going to apologize. 2) The accused admitted to punching the complainant in the face several times. He said he choked the complainant at one point. The complainant's testimony was choked and there was no evidence of an essential element of the offence.  3) The Court found that the accuseds were both justified in using force to defend themselves or any one under his protection from assault if he used no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it. The actions of both accused was aggressive. They both took necessary and lawful action to protect themselves and their family. The injuries would have been far more severe if this had actually happened and the furious struggle between the complainant and the defendant when he said that he felt threatened. As the accused said that they were trying to break the back passenger window, Dagenaises choked him and he was forced to leave. The Crown and the defence witnesses were not cross-examined."
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law.

At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","The appellant and his wife appealed a corollary relief judgment, dividing matrimonial assets and ordering support for the children of the marriage, with respect to their effective commencement date. The husband argued that he should have included in the assets money manager account the money had already been divided equally by the parties. The trial judge observed in his decision that the furniture had not required consideration by him. The appellant sought an earlier effective date so he could obtain income tax deductions for monies he paid prior to March 1, 1991 covering largely expenses relating to the matrimonial home in which the wife was living with the children.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995.[1] The appellant appealed the decision of Matheson J. confirming the second decision of that Board appointed to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In the appeal, the appellant argued that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with cost on double Column V.  1)The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliant with the Order and to take measures to ensure that the contraventions would not occur again. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The Board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant complied with the required time. 2)The board reserved jurisdiction to determine the extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', and whether it had been complied with. The very question the Board reserved jurisdiction in so deciding."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant applied to have the Court of Appeal dismiss his summary judgment application on the basis that the chambers judge had erred in the application of the test for summary judgment. The chambers judge found that the defendant had met the burden placed upon him in the examination of the affidavit and found that there was at least a genuine issue of fact to be determined at trial. The issues were: 1) whether the Chambers judge had relied on the hearsay and 'unnamed' sources referred to in the affidavit; 2) if the Chambers Judge had accepted the exhibits, the statements, the discovery evidence and perhaps the evidence of the plaintiff's lawyer but did not refer at all to the exhibits attached to the affidavit. The Chambers judge did not err in dismissing the application; and 3) the issue of credibility was not raised in the reasons provided in the summary judgment decision. Allowing the application, that there is at least one genuine issue that should be left to be decided at trial, and that the Chamber judge did err in not failing to do so. The Chamber judge made no error in relying on the affidavit or accepting the exhibits."

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The petitioner’s petition for division of property, joint custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time and costs were granted. The applicant also brought an amendment to the interim custody order in order to tide things over until trial could be held. The interim agreement provided that the petitioner would have Z. in the interim care of the petitioner and the respondent would have access to his mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The child was born in December 2012. Throughout the relationship, the petitioner said the respondent had verbally abused the child and had threatened to take it out on him. He denied any contact with the child, claimed that the child was his responsibility, and that he had no money to give him. The evidence showed that the parties followed the interim orders and then ordered an expedited pre-trial conference to have everything put together and sent over before anything else could occur. HELD: 1)The petitioner was concerned that the respondent was holding the child from her and that she was unable to get him to come to her house. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back. 2)The respondent was not working and was in constant pain. He refused to take the child to the hospital. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had been locked out since the December 2012 order. 5)It was clear from the outset that the issues between the parties were not being resolved that a reasonable solution was to have the child live with the petitioner rather than have him move with her to another residence. 6)There was nothing wrong with the basic premise of the petition: that a child should be in the custody of his mother so that she could come pick him up from her house at the appropriate time. The administration of justice was also discussed. 6).The petitioner had no claim to the parenting time of the child. The relationship was fostered by the fact that the two parties had not spoken for some time. There was a significant amount of conflicting affidavit material filed. 7)The evidence was that the father had not been paying child support for the petitioner for the past 3 years. He was using the money he was given to pay the lawyer for the duration of the agreement. The lawyer was not able to contact the child for several days because of the difficulty in reaching the agreed-upon time limit. 8)There were no reasonable"

Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges.

At trial, the plaintiff brought an expert's report alleging that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that there was a clear conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. The Crown appealed the conviction alleging negligence and breach of contract. The court found that the video re-enactment and related photos did not accurately represent the scene at the time of the collision and that the evidence should not have been admitted into evidence. Further, the Court found that certain portions of the legal counsel's report would have been admissible but, in the absence of the expert report, the defendant failed to object to the admission of the still photographs. Finally, the court noted that some of the issues raised by the defence during cross-examination were not raised at trial as the issue of the plaintiff's competency in representing the plaintiff was not raised during the appeal."
c_2006skpc93.txt,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff sought general and aggravated damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The R.M. council was divided into two factions following the plaintiff's motion to tender the contract for building inspection services. One of the factions opposed the contract and sought legal advice from the defendant's legal counsel as to how to handle the conflict of interest issue. The administrator of the council advised the plaintiff that she would not be able to participate in council meetings if the contract was not awarded because the plaintiff had moved the motion forward because he had failed to comply with the company's requests to remedy his deficiencies. When the meeting was completed, all further written communications were given to the plaintiff by the legal counsel to the defendant. The plaintiff and two other councillors left the meeting before the issue was dealt with. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was acting with knowledge that she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant acted with knowledge she had had no authority to act in her personal capacity in imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff and that her actions were not negligent."

An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S.; and 3) the Workers's Compensation Benefits Act states that the Plaintiff's only possible claim is for workers compensation benefits from the Workers’ Compensation Board. 4) The Claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. 5) If the circumstances warrant and one or more conditions pursuant to subrule (2) apply, the Court may order the pleading or other document to be struck out assuming it disclosed no reasonable claims or defence."
d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude s.24(2) of the Charter. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s.254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the body at the time of the ASD demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonable belief of alcohol in his or her body. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make formal breath demand. The wording of s. 254(2)(g) does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in body. Legislative priority has removed the process from the consideration of the degree of impairment that is displayed before the demand is made. The test is consumption alone and not its amount or behaviourial consequences. The officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before me leading to such demand."

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant contended that the Provincial Court judge soconcerned himself with the credibility of the evidence of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider.

The appellant appealed. Besides the appellant, another person was present at the time of the incident out of which the charge arose. He was Kim Wall.

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service. Ivy and Richie did not appear at the hearing and the decision does not even identify Richie as being one of the tenants. More is required to ensure service of and notice to all the tenants. 3) There are no notes nor is there anything in the decision which would permit the Court to conclude that the issue of service on Ivy and Richie was ever considered by the Rentalsman.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent had not exceeded the effective date and that it would not order retroactive support. It would not burden the payor with the burden of maintaining the child who was living with the father for the past three years. The respondent’s annual Federal Child Support Guidelines (FCSG) were varied to reflect the change in circumstances between the parties. In the interim, the respondent agreed to reduce the table amount of child support to $380 per month from the amount set out in the FCSG. The parties did not reach an agreement regarding the amount of monthly child support payable. The petitioner”s conduct was not blameworthy”. The SCC noted that the Supreme Court of Canada had summarized the balancing of interests in DBS: 1)No agreement was entered into as a result of the breakdown of the 1999 child support order. The agreement was voluntary and the petitioner was not required to disclose her tax return or notice of assessment annually. 2)There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the tax return. The father”d not be responsible for the child”, asserted the SCC. 3)The court found that the petitioner had not engaged in blammanship. Rather than returning to the court to assess and determine the petitioner“s responsibility to pay child support,” the parties negotiated through their lawyers and the mother” and the father was not responsible for its preparation. The fact that the parties had agreed upon the division of the Canada Child Tax Benefit and GST, the manner in which income credits and spousal deduction were to be deducted from the Table amount, and the respondent was content to accept $380 as fair level of support for both children until 2003 when it was varied to $375. 4)The respondent” sine die certiorari non curat lex. 5)The petitioner’d obligation to pay retroactive child support of $4,322 was not considered blamed.  6)No costs were assessed on a solicitor/client basis. 7)The SCC stated that the court would not substitute a monetary award for a retroactive award. 8)There were no breaches of the agreed 2003 agreement. 9)The increase in the petitioner income over the years 2002 to 2005 inclusive was not so dramatic as to constitute blamed conduct. 10)The applicant” did not contribute to the children”"

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"The parties were at odds over who was at fault as matter of law for a low speed collision and the subsequent damage to the tractor and his wife. The ultimate disagreement was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. The only material difference was that the plaintiff had his vehicle overtaken by a half-ton truck which was parked directly in the front of his vehicle. The defendant's wife was with him that morning and corroborated his version of the facts as to the presence of the half truck. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced. The evidence, taken together with the exhibits (consisting of diagrams and photographs), did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability. 2)The physical evidence could not support either version of events related to the court by the parties. 3)The plaintiff's evidence contained an equally rational explanation for what transpired."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. Following a jury conviction, the applicant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. The latter were both upheld on appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) In this case, the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the fact the police officer was not called to testify. She said it might appear extremely relevant that he was not brought forward to testify on the critical issue of identification. However, in more general terms, the court also instructed the jury to treat police officers like other witnesses when assessing their testimony. 3) The appellant was not left with the impression that it should place special, or indeed any, weight on the R. v. Cook (1997 CanLII 392), [1997] S.C.R. 1113 where the convictions were determined on the basis of the same issues as the appellant's appeal. The issues were not so clearly identified. The jury was only given an opportunity to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the Constable.

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13. The defendant earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the reduced assessment in March 1997 but in September 1997 the utility and review board issued a $420k.13 property tax refund cheque to the plaintiff. In September 1997, HRM issued $420K.13 to the defendant. HRM sought interest on the overpayment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. A rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75) was an appropriate rate on the principal amount of the outstanding for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March, 1997 and the payment of the property tax refunds in September and September, as well as on the unpaid interest until date of judgment.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the counts and sentenced him to three years imprisonment. He pleaded guilty to one count of theft. He had no income and would not have any for some time. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to eight years and six months. The credit for time served on remand was increased to account for any aggravating circumstances. The Court found that the offences were most unusual and that the conduct of the accused was most unusual in that it occurred while he was in prison. It is not surprising that the accused pleaded guilty. While it was a long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. It has eliminated the necessity for many people testifying and going through the consequent discomfort. The accused deserves credit for his plea."
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge interpreting s. 89(1) of the Indian Act to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the respondent Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The trial judge held that s.89(1)(b) was applicable and set aside the provisions of s.87(1). He also held that the respondent had priority over the second assignee in the sense that the conditional sales agreements covered by the previous contract between the respondent and the defendant should be affected by the subsequent assignment of Fagel's book debts. The appeal was allowed. All the assignments which were made by the Respondent pursuant to the Construction Contract with the Receiver were void. S.89 (1) was not intended to prevent an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements in conjunction with the operation of commercial business. The act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he holds and deals with his or her business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. The protection afforded by s.84(1 of the Act for the purposes of registration under the Act was limited and the respondent could deal with his accounts receivable as any other Indian on a reserve."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire, the defendant moved to another location and destroyed the plaintiff's building. The plaintiff sought production of all documents relating to the second fire, particularly: a complete copy of investigative files prepared by government authorities, the Town of Stellarton Fire Department, and any internal investigation, including statements by employees or others; and a complete file of any insurers who carried out investigations. The defendant submits the documents are relevant to the present action. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court awards costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings 2 years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents related to the Second Fire. The fact that the defendants moved out of a leased premises in May 2009 resulted in destruction of that building. Rule 14.01 displaces the former semblance of relevancy test. This requires motions judge to decide relevency based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. Brown vs. Cape Breton Regional Municipality, [2011 NSCA 32] Rule 13.01 provides that relevant and relevant documents have the same meaning as at the trial of an action or on the hearing of an application and, for greater clarity, both of the following apply on determination of relevenancy under this Part: (a) judge who determines relevancies of document, electronic information, or other things sought to be disclosed or produced must make the determination by assessing whether a judge presiding at a trial or hearing of the proceeding would find the document relevant or irrelevant; (b) a determination is rebuttable; and (c) there is no evidence before the court as to the manner of operation of the defendant's business in the second location that would establish relevance to the issues of negligence raised in the pleadingings. No supplemental affidavits or further evidence have been provided following discoveries. The uncommonality of the buildings 2.5 years apart did not justify disclosure."

While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the Court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A. who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift or to maintain the schedule existing prior to its decision under appeal. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Kleebuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The parties were to be governed by the order of Wright J. unless otherwise agreed and until further order. The parties are to be bound by the Order of WrightJ. Under this order, $600.00 maintenance is payable by the father on the first of each month. The judgment roll 'vacates' the respondent's order."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The accused had been acquitted of the first count and remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused was given credit for time spent on remand on the basis of for which would amount in to 33 months credit. The court found that the offences were particularly aggravating given the fact that the accused had prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. The evidence at trial indicated that the person who fired the gun at the victim was someone who lived in the area near the bar where the shootings occurred."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253 of the Criminal Code. The Crown obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Peace in January 2009. The warrant resulted in the blood samples being taken from the accused. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples. The issues before the court were whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant, whether the information was a reasonable grounds for an accused's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter, and whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report were evidence sufficient grounds to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue. HELD: 1) The officer who signed the Information To Obtain was required to provide his reasonable ground for belief. He omitted a crucial ground for his belief. The officer did not depose that the accused was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was unconscious with his feet located in the driver's leg area and his body slumped across the seat. The information totain does not include the source of his belief that the driver was the driver of the car nor does it refer to the reliability of the source's belief. 2) There were witnesses at the scene of the accident who had not seen anyone flee from the vehicle. 3) The information was not a reasonable ground upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory pre-conditions of s. 256 of the Code existed. 4) In this case, the officer testified that he thought the accused had been driving his vehicle that early morning, had been in an accident, and was in a position to control it. He and EMS personnel arrived at the same time and were able to assist in the recovery of the injured male. 5) There was a breach of the accused's s.8 rights respecting the taking of samples of blood. 6) The evidence which the officer deposed in the Information Testament should be admitted into evidence at trial. The Certificate of Analysis was not sufficient to satisfy the Court's questions as to the adequacy of the information and the credibility of the report. 7) The Court concluded that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the accused committed an offence under s.253. 8 The officer failed to communicate this basic information to the Justice respecting the attendance of the witnesses."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.

The general principles favouring the claim must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute, the order set out in the decision set out by the judge in Gillis v. Soulis. In this respect, the case Gillis was not determinative of the issue but it was a very brief decision which was in error in concluding that it was determinative. All the evidence had been placed before the judge and no transcript of evidence was placed before him. No transcript had been obtained nor had there been a hearing or directing of the appeal.

The plaintiff now had the option to bring an action for damages against the government claiming that the pension was not payable.

In 1989 the vessel was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990 an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel had been registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded in January 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 2(4) is a supplementary provision to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax. It is a provision which, if enacted, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121. All Articles of Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall be admitted free into each of the other provinces. The provision equalizes the burden by taxing out ofprovince purchases by provincial residents at the same rates as if the purchases had taken place in the provincial capital.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The respondent Board issued an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, quashing the respondent Board's decision to deny the applicant's application for dependent benefits. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband, a student, might be in need of some assistance in terms of employment. The respondent Board denied the application and, in the circumstances, did not apply the presumption contained in s.30 of the Workers' Compensation Act in favour of the applicant. The Board then determined that the applicant was not found dead within the meaning of the Act and that the application for benefits was denied. HELD: The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard.  1)Section 45 of the legislation provides for a six month limitation period for applications in which the applicant can claim a declaration as collateral or alternate relief, an injunction or damages as collateral relief, or both. 2)Saskatchewan Worker's Compensation Board's Decision: Section 45 does not bar the applicant from making a claim for compensation for the death of her husband on her own behalf or on behalf of her daughter as dependants of his. 3)Section 47 does not apply in this case. The test in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) was reviewed and the policies must not take the Board beyond the discretion afforded to them by the statute. 4)The respondent board filed the appropriate return pursuant to s.669(3). 5)Section 46 of the Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Act was amended in 1999 to provide for a further six month reporting period. 6)The trial judge noted that s.22 does not shield the Board’s decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not “intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board.”  6)In this case, the only compelling reasons for the delay in making the claim were the absence of adequate medical care, lack of evidence to connect the death to their employment, nor any evidence to establish that the death was not work-related. 7)The evidence did not support the conclusion that the respondent board acted outside its jurisdiction in denying benefits. 8)The Court reviewed the relevant s.45 and s.46 of the code and found that they did not act in accordance with the principles of the law and principles of administrative law,"

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The court granted the divorce and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program. The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the court to delay the trial. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to attend school with the respondent. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of the divorce are present. The matter will not get past a pre- trial conference for several months to decide whether to proceed with the parenting arrangements. As the child is only five days removed from having given birth, matters involving the children and the petitioner's parenting are very much in flux. The court should carefully review the material to determine whether there exists a compelling reason to change an interim order. This is one of those things that arose during the course of an action and following an interim court order being made. There is more than a minor change in circumstances and the threshold test set forth in Guenther has been met. HELD: 1)The child was to be registraded in a MontessorI program. 2)The petitioner was ordered to have the child in the program by the petitioner. 3)The parties were able to transport him to the program. 4)The court was not required to make any determinations on either the creditability of the parties or on any allegations of misrepresentation having been made. The facts of this matter speak for themselves and allow for decisions to be made on the various issues. 5)The applicant was granted access to the courtroom. 6)The children were to have additional time with the petitioner and to have her accompany him to his appointments and activities. 7)The respondent was to have custody and access. 8)The issues of child and parenting were to be decided on the basis of the evidence before the court. 9)The Court was prepared to impose costs on the application."

A ten year firearm, ammunition and explosives prohibition order was made against the appellant pursuant to the provisions of s. 100(1) of said Code. A 10 year firearm prohibition Order was made in the same circumstances as the 6 months term imposed in 1989 when he was convicted of an '08 offence at time he was only about 20 years of age.

The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child.

Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the father. The father sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. He argued the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. All jurisdictional elements have been proven. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2) The parties agreed in the interim that their child would not be removed from his home. There was no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. It was entirely foreseeable that mobility would become an issue at some point. No one prevented the father from expressly addressing this point before the agreement was entered into. The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parents. 3) The father agreed to pay child and spousAL support in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or the circumstances of the parties lives. It is clearly unequal favouring the wife. There were significant changes in the life of the father since the signing of the separation agreement. The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. 4) The mother was to have the benefit of a matrimonial home which was to be her home. She also had the option of staying in the home with her family. 5) The husband was to assume all of the household expenses, including the cost of living, in his name and with the assistance of the paternal grandparents. The paternal grandparents were to have joint custody of the home. Their daughter would be able to take part in the household activities. 6) The respondent failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause. Instead of explicitly indicating his intent he assumed the joint custody order would protect his interests. The agreement clearly favoured the mother and all of her children. The respondent gave the consideration required to finalize their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. It may be unfair in that it was obvious what he intended and wanted. There are no circumstances to suggest this was unconscriptable."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence which was to the effect that he was suffering from a panic attack, raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the transcript she had prepared for her appeal. At the time of her appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal naming only Her Majesty the Queen and Queen's Counsel as respondents to the appeal and to have the respondents pay for the preparation of the appeal book and certification of the transcript; in addition to the general wrongdoing of participants in the justice system with whom she had been involved in in the course of her criminal appeal, both of her appeals had been dismissed for failure to perfect. The appellant argued that the appeal had dragged on for almost a year and that if she did not file her materials as required her appeal may be dismissed. No date for the filing of the required materials was set. The respondents' motions to dismiss both appeals were granted. HELD: The appellant's motions to consolidate both appeals are dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The appellant had not provided certified transcripts. Given that the dismissal of her Criminal Appeal prevented her from having the merits of her Appeal determined, which she made clear were of vital importance to her personally and which she believed were of great public importance because they involve finding that she was not criminally responsible with respect to the public mischief charge, and because there was no evidence that the respondents would be able to apply to dismiss her appeal on an ex parte basis for dismissal, the court dismissed both of them. 2)There was no merit to the appellant's argument that she could not provide certified transcripts unless the respondents paid. As argued by the AGNS, it would be unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts. The suggestion at the end of the hearing that perhaps she could ask legal aid to pay for this was not realistic. 3)The court dismissed the appellant’s motion to consolidate the two appeals on the basis that she had failed to comply with the filing she was required to do in order to get her appeal to the point where it could be dealt with by the Court of Appeal."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The evidence was so frail as to leave the court to rely on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he made in an abrupt manner as he passed the only other vehicle in the immediate vicinity. As well, although the vehicle wandered somewhat within its lane, it did not stray into the other lane. 3)The accused did not show any signs of intoxication. The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 4)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the Court to rely upon them on an issue of presumption of innocence, which was to be determined in this case. The accused's explanation for the alleged erratic driving was that it was windy, windy and he had been in the habit of weaving in the lane. 5)The officer noted that the accused's vehicle had been speeding and that it had not done any of the lane changes he had noted. 6)The court gave careful consideration to the evidence of the alleged 'erratic driving' and the accused’s explanation for it, and noted that his blood alcohol consumption, and his response in stopping was somewhat delayed, and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly 2 minutes."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","This was a motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the mother asked for a dismissal of the matter on the basis that the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. Because the trial was scheduled to start tomorrow, the court had no opportunity to reserve, other than for a few hours. The mother had made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. The motion was granted. The trial was to commence tomorrow. The court has not lost its jurisdiction in this matter."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The victim of a car robbery was found in the car with the gun and stolen property, in the company of two young men who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car, loaded. The victim was not asked to implicate the victim directly but said that he had been picked up by the other two men when the others were picked up in at some building, somewhere in Fairview. The circumstantial evidence at this point is that the person who was in the vehicle at the time of the stop was not the person that was picked up. HELD: The evidence of the victim’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the defendant was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. This inference might be entirely reasonable."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully harvesting forest products and found that it should have quashed the sentence. The conviction was upheld on the basis that there was no evidence that could support a finding that the firewood sold to the undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the illegal sale of the wood was not the subject matter of this appeal. The appeal court also appealed the sentence imposed on the appellant for unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The issues on appeal were whether there was evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict and whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge’s conclusion. On the factual grounds, the standard of review is whether there is evidence uponwhich a triering-fact could reasonably be found to support the trial judge. The appellant was found not guilty on the trafficking charge because the evidence did not come directly from the Crown. The Crown appealed the sentencing of the appellant on the issue of unlawfully trafficking. HELD: 1)The appellant was convicted of trafficking forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) and s. 822 of the Criminal Code. 2)He was found guilty of unlawfully selling forest products on Crown lands and unlawfully possessing forest products from private lands. 3)Given that the defendant was entitled to harvest dead wood from Crown land for his personal heating purposes and that he was permitted to harvest wood for his own use, there was an error of law by the lower court in relation to the wood being sold to him. Thus, the appellant court should intervene if the decision is not correct in law unless there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice that has occurred. 4)On appeal, the court may allow a Crown appeal where a conviction for unlawfully harvesting, or on any ground if there was a miscarriageof justice. 5)The evidence of conservation officers was uncontradicted."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008. The contracts each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The respondent sought to have the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The IDSL was the primary operating agreement and was automatically renewed for successive 3 year terms, unless either party cancelled the contract in writing at least 60 days prior to the renewal date. HAL did not have the means to appeal on this basis. The only way to do so was by giving notice to the arbitration panel and requesting 180 days notice. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. If the right to appeal is not abrogated by the language of the agreements, the court does not have licence to reconstruct a contract on equitable principles or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 2)The language of these agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitrator's decision and the finality of the arbiters' decision that it cannot be taken to have abrogator its right. 3)HAL could not seek leave on questions of law, pursuant to s.45(2) of the Act. The implied term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. 4)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permitted. The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which a appeal could be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional. 5)It is clear from the wording of the arbitration agreement that the agreements in place between the parties (the IDSL, the SCA and the ESMA) contain an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal an arbitrators’ decision based on a very limited nature of potential appeals."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that when the defendant's vehicle passed hers, a piece of metal came off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet and hit the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of wood and reported that it did not come from the tractor- trailer. The experts concluded that the piece had not flown from the trailer and therefore there was no issue to be tried. The claim was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had met the threshold test of establishing a material fact requiring a trial and that the plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence to support the bare allegation made in the pleadings. There was no genuine issue for trial and the defendant was found to have borne the costs of the discovery."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina and breasts numerous times on a regular basis. He often slept on the couch or in the living room adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love-seat in the house adjacent to where the complainant usually stayed up at least until midnight. Sometimes he would walk into the bedroom and have sex with her. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had explanations for each of the alleged incidents. He said that he was drunk, had a drink and was prone to touching his privates. He claimed that he fell on top of her when she was sleeping. He denied touching her breasts, he said that his job in the home was to clean up 'dog shit' and that he sometimes got drunk. The following evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony: 1) The accused was found guilty of both charges. He was not guilty of either charge. 2) The Court was not satisfied with the accused's evidence. The Court would have been more satisfied if the Court had found the accused guilty of all of the offences. The Crown must have had evidence of reasonable guilt and consciences, a reasonable understanding of his place in the world, and reasonable remorse and regret for his actions. The accused would not have done anything that would have resulted in a sentence of life imprisonment. There would be insufficient evidence to convict him of all the offences and a lack of evidence of remorse, which would have led to the incarceration of the accused for common sense offences and breach of an undertaking. There is insufficient evidence surrounding the conduct the accused exhibited in the conduct of his children. There must be a sufficient evidence base for the Crown to conclude that the offences were committed against the complainant and not against the accused himself. The court was also required to take judicial notice of the allegations made against him."

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was born of the marriage. The mother was the primary caretaker of the children and her role was to report to the father final decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and the children’s regular activities. The father had been paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expense and was concerned that the children would need counseling to adjust to the separation or to cope with the conflict created by their parents. The evidence from the mother and her witnesses differed materially from that given by the father and her. HELD: 1) Shared parenting was appropriate. If custody and primary care were granted to the mother, she would have no reason to develop a better relationship with the Father and the likely result would be a steady alienation of her children from the father. Section of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was considered and the set-off was appropriate including the pre-marital pension benefits. 2) The relationship was fostered by mutual agreement and the father was to pay $502 per month for child care and Taekwondo. 3) There was no presumption that the father would be willing to make significant changes in the circumstances to ensure the children were in the best interests of their children. 4) The evidence established that the parties, and particularly the Mother, had a reasonable understanding of each other's needs and did not wish to alienate the children from their father. 5) The court found that the information provided by the parties and their witnesses was credible. The information did not conflict with the father”s position. 6) The father was not seeking joint custody, custody, or shared parenting. The children were to be in the joint custody of the father with the mother."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appeals his convictions for careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He alleges the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result; in finding that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances; and in finding the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) are unconstitutional. The appellant was acquitted on four of the charges. He was sentenced for the ss. 86(1), 88(1, and 95(2) offences. He had been released on his own recognizance in the amount of $25,000 without deposit. He submitted that he had no criminal record, substantial assets, favourable pre-sentence report, or passport, and that he was not a flight risk. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) The appellant has no prior criminal record. He complied with the terms of his release pending appeal. He has been on bail for 16 months without incident. 2) There is no evidence that the appellant has changed in any meaningful way. If everyone using firearms in furtherance of other illegal activities in the province of Alberta had been permitted to use them, life would be much easier for the offender. 3) The principles of reviewability of convictions and enforceability of judgment until it has been reversed or set aside are largely balanced in the public interest. The Crown does not allege that the grounds of appeal are frivolous. It is otherwise preferable that no more be said at this stage concerning the merits of the appeal."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without the terms of two execution orders previously issued against the plaintiff judgment debtors to the plaintiff, who were successful litigants in this action, and the defendants moving parties. The plaintiff brought a motion to have the execution orders, previously issued in 2010 against the defendants judgment debtORS to the plaintiffs, who had been successful litigators in the action. The defendants sought the order, which was refused, on the grounds the affidavit evidence did not reveal where the loans came from or if they will reduce the exigible assets, available for execution, were available for that matter. HELD: The Court was unable to grant the proposed order. The proposed order was made less than a month after the defendants moved to prevent the court from granting the order."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It would be unfair to the accused in any event to waste time and money on a motion that requires the Crown to lead the evidence on voirs dire. The Court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. 2)There will be occasions, however, when the Crown will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation and the accused will be given some latitude at some stage of the trial to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial. There will also be situations where the Crown must seek leave to cross-examine the accused on the voir d dire. In these circumstances, the Crown would be in a position to demand the accused answer questions as to his or her position on possible Charter issues. 3)The Court was unable to see any justification for the proposed procedure. In Provincial Court it will be for the trial judge to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue and defence counsel should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclusion is made."

The petitioner claimed spousal maintenance, costs and division of matrimonial property. The respondent attended the trial without counsel.

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","HELD: The trial was directed on the issues of the residence of the petitioner mother and the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and any s. 7 expenses. The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner Mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The father was to pay support in the amount of $1,486 per month for the s.7 expenses for a period of no more than five months. Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application was sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.

e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle was acquitted. The court found that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness, who provided exculpatory evidence, was found not guilty. The appeal court also held that the respondent's observations concerning slurred speech while he was detained and prior to being granted the right to counsel were inadmissible. The respondent was acquitted of both charges on the basis that the observations were not part of conscripted evidence, which would place the administration of justice into disrepute in a Charter analysis. The appellant's s. 8 Charter rights were excluded."

c_2005skpc55.txt,"The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She earned $657.83. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73.","The plaintiff sought wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of her employment. The defendant advertised for two positions in the local newspaper. The advertised position for a receptionist had been advertised but had not been delivered. The plaintiff claimed that the job advertised for a'summer student' with a minor in history and that she had been negligent in not processing certain documents. HELD: The defendant was dismissed without just cause. 1)It was well established law that section 43 of the Act provides a minimum notice period and does not prevent an employee from seeking remedy at common law for a breach of contract. 2)The plaintiff was dismissed for just cause and, if not, the measure of damages to which the plaintiff would be entitled."
5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting them to commence a derivative action against the defendant, based on their claim that he had been forced to resign as a result of the defendant's actions. Oickle, the other appellant, applied for leave to appeal the order permitting him to amend his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' to his counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the defendants. The defendant had previously been a director of the company. He had filed a cause of action in defamation against the plaintiff, but had since transferred his shares to the defendant in 1994. At the time of the plaintiff's incorporation, the defendant was a director and the defendant remained a shareholder. The defendants sued Oickle in 2003 alleging that Oickle surreptitiously competed against the company during his employment, appropriated opportunities that would have been available to the company, and misused company resources to support his competition. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant and his new counsel, Goldberg, agreed to a share buyback agreement which allowed Oickle to withdraw his admissions. Goldberg applied for orders permitting the application to withdraw the admissions and for an application for an interim injunction restraining Oickle from soliciting the Company's customers or from competing with it. The appellants had sought to have Oickle's admission withdrawn on the basis that it conflicted with their claim for a share repurchase agreement. Goldberg argued that the judge erred in applying the less restrictive test in Abacus, but did not err in the test applied when he determined Oickle should be permitted to withdraw. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The court found no error in applying Rule 21.02(4) to the second ground of appeal. 2)The judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order. The words used in clause 5.03 were that there was no temporal connection between the defendant’s rights as a shareholder and the impugned acts of oppression and that the order spoke prospectively not retroactively. 3)There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request. The judge was aware of the alleged discord among the parties over a long period of time causing him to draw an analogy between disputes of this kind among shareholders and corporate actions. 4)The Court found no detrimental reliance, no estoppel."
e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","The Crown applied for a review under s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.

After reviewing the decision of Justice Cromwell and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, and on the facts of this case, the Crown sought a review. Counsel for the Crown relied upon his submission that the appellant, who was on parole at the relevant time prior to the 679 application, was not in custody and therefore, the Court of Appeal was not entitled to inquire into that claim. HELD: The appeal would be allowed in full on the basis that the decision the Chambers judge made was in custody within the meaning of s.679. The court of appeal refused to issue a written decision denying the release. Based upon the opinion of the dissenting judge in this appeal, the court concluded that the Chambers Judge misinterpreted the definition of custody.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the mother for several years and that her relationship with her daughter and the psychological father had been problematic. The child had a history of violence against her and had been sexually assaulted by her mother. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of the Child Protection and Custody Act. The agency had taken the child into care because there was a substantial risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child and that the risk of the child suffering harm due to their repeated moves and the abuse of the children. The respondent mother and her daughter had discussed the possibility of having the child returned to their care. HELD: The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was on the Agency. It was a civil burden of burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. The evidence from child protection workers, child protection officers, parents and others who had participated in child protection proceedings was sufficient to warrant an order for permanent care. Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent the respondent mother. There was insufficient evidence from the child protection worker to justify the granting of a protection order. There were insufficient resources to conduct a risk assessment and any subsequent access would result in a denial of the protection order which would have resulted in a declaration that the children were in need of protective services."

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

He entered a not guilty plea and requested the first available date (December 18, 2003) and requested a postponement of the trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The accused waived his right to a fair and balanced trial and argued that the length of the delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)Prejudice to the accused may be inferred. The longer the delay the easier it may be for the court to infer prejudice. 3)Pre-trial Arguments and Lead Evidence are Essential to a Fair and Balanced Criminal Justice System, but are not Required in the slightest. 4)There was no evidence that the accused waived any rights, explicitly or implicitly. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of Breathalyzers, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss. 8, s.9 and s9 Charter motions, the delay is likely to be detrimental to quality of the evidence tendering.  5)The applicant did not waive any rights.  6)Costs in the amount of $100,000 were added to the total cost of the application."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that the lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act and that the responding plaintiff failed to show that his claim had a real chance of success. Gilbert also appealed to the Supreme Court alleging that the judge erred in granting Chrysler's motion. Appeal dismissed. The material facts were not in dispute. The lease agreement was assigned to Chrysler. The plaintiff, while driving the leased vehicle, was involved in an accident which resulted in personal injuries to the defendant. The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak). The lease contains the characteristics noted in sec. 2 (ak); it cannot realistically be depicted as a rental contract as defined in s 62. Further support for the Bazley criteria can be found in s. 61, which falls under the heading of 'For Rent Cars'."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","The accused was charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and one count of attempting to strike his estranged wife with a motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. The Court must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the intention of the accused. The Crown has failed to prove the guilt of the Crown on this count to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and must find the accused not guilty of Count No. 1. The injuries to the complainant were accidental and the bruises sustained by the victim may have resulted from her fall on the concrete driveway. However, the Crown has proven the accused to be dangerous to the public because the crime was committed in a manner that is unnecessary and is unnecessary. 2) The accused is guilty of lying to the Court. The admission that he slung the complainant on the ground and that he got more aggressive and kicked her is overwhelming. The evidence that the accused assaulted the complainant and in doing so caused her bodily harm is overwhelming and the evidence of tire marks on the driveway cannot be accepted as having any impact on the case nor is it suggested by the Crown that they should. 3) In order to convict the Crown of this charge the Crown must prove the menses rea, actus rus, and mens viva voce. The criminal element of this offence requires a reasonable suspicion of the person accused of driving the vehicle. It is not reasonable to expect the accused who operates the vehicle to be reasonably dangerous. Given the amount of alcohol consumed at the scene of the offence, the Court cannot conclude the accused drove the truck dangerously close to the parties while they were arguing. The accused backed up the truck and came forward on more than one occasion and barely missed hitting the complainant while she was laying on the couch. 4) The evidence establishes the accused committed an actus dangerous to public safety. It establishes the absence of reasonable doubt as to the purpose of driving."

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act. The reasons for the decision were: 1) the mother's lack of involvement in the child's life was due more to concern that the father would be held responsible for an injustice than any other factor; and 2) the father had not bothered to have any involvement with the child from the time he was an infant until he was again contacted by the mother. The father's seeming inability to facilitate access to his mother and his sister especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. The court lifted the stay in proceedings arising pursuant to Rule 15(4)."

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and Rule 49 of the Court of Court of appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. They argued that the learned chambers judge erred in law in failing to find that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. Consequently, no common issue could reasonably be certified. They also raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 4(a) the chambers judge failed to apply the Rule 173c analysis when determining whether'some basis in fact' supported the existence of a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c); 5 (b) the Chambers judge errried in law by conflating foreseeability with proximity in the first leg of the Ann's test; and (c) the judge failed in law to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate the finding of duty of justice under the second leg of that test; 6(3) the class actions Act provides that leave of justice of this Court is prerequisite for all appeals from an order certifying or refusing to certify an action as class action. The criteria to be considered in leave applications were articulated by Cameron J.A. in Rothmans, Benson Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan and were well known to counsel. Generally, leave is granted or withheld in consideration of merit and importance as follows: 1) the proposed appeal of a Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(C) application and certified the actions as a Class action against the defendants; 2) the parties advanced arguments in support of the motion that the tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors; and 3) the issues were advanced by the parties in supporting the motion and advancing the arguments of the experts.

Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result at the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir dave but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and the seizure were incidental to the arrest. The Court found the accused's arrest was justified based upon her reasonable expectation of privacy. The restriction that the search must be truly incidental to a arrest means that the police must be attempting to achieve some valid purpose connected to that arrest. Whether such an objective exists will depend on what the Crown were looking for and why. The actions of the police were not unlawful with respect to either the arrest or search and seizure of the evidence."

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s stepmother had called the accused prior to the search of their home and the accused was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition. The evidence at trial had revealed that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the home with his mother. At issue was the validity of the search warrant for the home and whether the accused possessed a firearm. HELD: 1)The accused was found guilty of possession of a prohibited weapon pursuant to s.8 of the Charter and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.  2)The evidence on the firearms seized was that of a witness and a witness. The witness’ testimony and the documentary evidence did not support any suggestion of a continuity problem. 3)Evidence on the possession issue was not used to determine the identity of the accused but rather to determine his Charter claim.  4)The Crown had established that the registered address of the witness was 80 Cavendish Road and the phone was in good standing. 5)The seized firearms were found to be firearms within the meaning of the Criminal Code and that they and two magazines had been correctly identified and classified in the charges against the accused.  6)The court was unable to accept that a witness could have a constructive and or joint possession relationship with a firearm even if it was a loaded Mark II or a Lakefield rifle. The Crown had indicated that the cartridge magazine to the Mark II was a prohibited device within s.84(1) of the Code and Part II of Part III of the Regulations. 7)The co-accused had admitted to having a gun in the home. 8)Individual and family members were not involved. The accused was acquitted of all charges. 9)The Court had no doubt that the evidence on all the charges was that the respondent had constructive, or joint, possession by the accused of the firearm and that his mother was in possession of them. 10)The respondent was found to have reasonable and probable cause to believe that the contents of his cell phone were admissible as evidence in this trial.  11)The applicant did not have a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor did he have valid registration certificate for any of the guns seized."

The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

Henry, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the rule that retroactive child support preceding commencement of the proceedings ought not to be granted in an application for interim support. 2)Following a review of the SSAG as a guide only, the Court ordered that the respondent pay retroactive support in the sum of $7,540 per month commencing November 1, 2013 and continuing until October 22, 2013. The total income of the petitioner is $55,103, consisting of wages of $50,603 and $5,500 derived from oil lease revenue. The husband earned rental income, after payment of property taxes, yields $8,000 to the respondent.

He said that he only had three beers in the car in the final five minutes of his visit at the uncle's house. 2) The officer testified that he smelled liquor on the defendant's breath and he could smell it coming from his head. 3) The medical technician testified that his first memory from the accident was of hitting the shoulder of the road, losing control of the vehicle and losing control. 4) The Crown awarded the s. 9(b)(iv) rights at the rate set out in Lamer v. Bartle. 5) The court discounted the weight of the accused's evidence considerably. It was not a question of whether the accused had signed a waiver, but rather that the accused understood what was being asked of him and had a reasonable understanding of his situation. The issues were not whether the admission of a waiver constituted a violation of his rights, but whether it was sufficient to justify it. The court noted that there was no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the defendant’s vehicle."

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused was charged with 21 counts under an indictment, of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused sought severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to separate the April 8th and April 14th counts and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences.HELD: The application for severance was dismissed on both the bases proposed. The Court must engage in a weighing exercise of all the relevant factors in deciding whether or not severance is required in the interests of justice. The issues are different but the issues are similar. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. It is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify on one set of counts and thereby be exposed to cross-examination on the other. In the present case the court has had the benefit of watching a videotaped interview of the accused conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010. In that interview, the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or that April 8. The Crown has in the wings a ballistics report containing expert opinion evidence that match has been made between the gun used in the April 7th shooting and that found by the arresting police officers on April 14. Defence counsel argues that whatever use was made of the firearm on April 7 would not touch on who might have had knowledge and control of it on that day. The overarching criteria for determining severance are: the interest of justice, the interests in justice, and the public interest in seeing justice done in a single trial. In this case the burden rests upon the accused, who remains free to control his defence as the case unfolds, in manner he deems appropriate. The evidence that the firearm was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on prosecution of April 8/April 14 events if it supported an inference that the accused is in possession of that firearm on that date. If found guilty of possession in relation to that date, certainly the evidence would be Admissible. If the accused were found not guilty of the possession count on April 15th, the Court would be unable to rely upon the evidence of proximity on"

HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","At the outset of the disposition review, the parties' children, K.B., C.B. and K.C. were apprehended by the Agency. The Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M. sought the termination of its involvement with the child K.D., and sought an order dismissing the Nova Scotia proceedings. The child protection worker assigned to the file confirmed that the Agency had already received a protection order from Nova Scotia which required the children to be placed in the custody of their father. The protection worker determined that the information concerning the children was simply not germane to the decision made. The agency had failed to disclose relevant information to the Agency, L.m. and to the court. The children had moved to Alberta with the intention of becoming foster parents and the parents had been involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The parents had lived in the home with the father for four years and had moved out of the home several times. The father had stopped living with the mother when she was pregnant with their third child and had taken the children out of foster care. The mother and the father had separated, and both parents now felt that the child protection history of the two children was not accurate as to the extent to which their current residence would be suitable for their current circumstances. Both parents expressed concern about the possibility of the children moving to Nova Scotia, and L.Ms. expressed concern that if the Agency knew the protection history, it would have consented to the children being placed with the other parent. Restriction on the file access: The files were hand-picked by the children's file managers and their attention was focused on the children and their needs. The file was hand-selected by the file managers based on their knowledge of the relevant material and their experience with the children. The files had no particular relevance to the disposition process. The information was only relevant to the father and the children had not been disclosed to the mother prior to the hearing. The documents contained historical references only and related, not to the parent, but rather to the common law partner. The document did not disclose any of the issues raised by the parties regarding the adoption of the third child (who had been placed in a foster home with his mother and who was now living with her sister).

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The complainant had worked in the courtroom of the provincial court building for some time prior to the accused assuming his duties as Justice of the Peace. She testified that the accused touched her leg, she heard him say something that surprised him, he had forgotten that she was'spoken for women'. The accused denied any inappropriate touching and said that he only asked her if she wanted to touch his penis. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The Court found that certain findings of credibility were made in this case. 2) The accused gave his evidence in an honest and straightforward fashion. He was vigorously cross-examined. While his recollection was not perfect, it was consistent. He believed that there was never ever any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. His evidence was found to be so inconsistent as to be unreliable. His comments were meant to be taken as an effort to mislead. His characterizations of his relationship with the complainant were inconsistent. 3) He failed to provide an adequate explanation for the comments made. He did not refer to them as inappropriate or inappropriate. 4) The complainant was clearly moved by the accused's comments. It was clear that he was trying to elicit information from the complainant and that his comments were intended to be directed at her. 5) He was aware that she had a family atmosphere in the building and that he had asked her to come to his condominium to use the swimming pool. She was shocked by the comment and suggested that her son might be interested. She did not object and he continued to touch her. He said he would 'help [her] in the department sometime.' She was not sure if he was offering to engage in sexual conduct with her but she believed that he did. He suggested that perhaps she should contact her son. She suggested that he contact her in person. He declined to do so. He dismissed the application. The Court held that it would be inappropriate for the Court to allow the Crown to enter the statement as evidence and, in that manner, to allow them to split its case. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness."

There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","This was an acrimonious custody dispute between two parties. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the two boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that both the mother and the counselling service were under-qualified to assess and counsel the children and that the report was prepared for use in family court custody proceedings. 3)The conduct of the counsellors and the court's consideration of the children's best interests, particularly in view of the fact that they were the only children in the family, was at odds. 4)The court dismissed the application for variation. 5)The information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given. 6)The co-defendants were ordered to disgorge the children with the full report. 7)Costs were left to the trial judge."

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The plaintiff and his passengers were on an international flight when mechanical difficulties resulted in an intercontinental flight delay. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) had been met by the applicant. HELD: The certification application is dismissed. 1)The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. The defendant plead guilty for breach of contract, breach of a contract or breach of any other contract. 2)The defendant's pleadings do not disclose a cause for action. 3)Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with regard its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. British Airways which involved a claim against a commercial passenger airline and package tour operator arising from a crash landing.

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were whether the father should pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; what, if any, retroactive support should be ordered in this matter; what retroactive spousal support was ordered; interim spousals should be payable by the father and the mother jointly; what if any retroactive maintenance should be paid in the amount of $8,000 per month; what percentage of all Sylvan Learning Centre costs should be given to the father; what amounts to interim spOUSAL support should not affect the right of the mother to pursue this pursuit in the future. HELD: 1)The father was ordered to contribute his proportionate share of all childcare costs and Sylvan learning centre expenses. The father's contribution was equal to 71% of the total cost. 2)The Sylvan Education costs were necessary and reasonable. The mother's evidence disclosed that both children were in need of a specialized educational program given their current problems at school. The Court directed s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child and child support applications. In the matter before me, the father was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father did not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the Mother once he had satisfied his child support obligations. 3)The Court ordered the father to pay costs in the sum of $400 to the petitioner pursuant to s.7(1)(d). The father was not required to pay.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in this matter is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the surplus. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplias are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand a class of 6,000 potential claimants, none of whom have been given notice of the interpleading application or of Ag credit's application. The argument that the surpleuses are property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it is not supported by the evidence. 2) While there is an arguable case that the claims of the insured clients to these surplums are not consistent with the interpretation of the Policy, Empire Life has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit should pay the premiums that resulted in the surplus. It is the essence of the underlying policy and the underlying purpose of the legislation that the surplus belongs to the clients. 3) While it may be in the interests of some clients to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as a class are entitled to receive the surplus, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily required an appropriate form of relief. 4) While the policy is intended to provide means by which claims can be justly resolved in or by court process in a timely and cost effective way, this section was never intended to deem property of third parties received by Ag Credit as property within the meaning of the Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 5) The parties may conclude that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court."

The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order. He appealed the conviction. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 2)Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the trial judge failed to properly consider the test for a defence of necessity. 3)The court found that there were no photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries. That was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone. 4)It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction and order a new trial."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed an issue on whether it was liable to the plaintiff for injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered. 2)The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 3)There have been many cases that have found a slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. However, the defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the produce department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by plaintiff. These findings leave only the third of the four principles to be addressed. 4)There was no evidence that the presence of water on the carpet in the vicinity of where the plaintiff slipped constituted an 'unusual danger.' The defendant did nothing to adduce evidence confirming that he had in fact cleaned the floor at 2:52 p.m. and made the entry on the sweep log. 5)There were no logs filed by the defendant prior to the date of the fall which raised any inference that it was the water that caused her to slip. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water. The defendants filed no logs. 6)The affidavit evidence of two assistant managers employed at the time of the incident confirmed the cleaning regimen in place at the store. 7)Statutes filed by and evidence obtained at the scene of the impact on the plaintiff, including logs, did not raise any adverse inference. 8)The presence of any unusual danger did not pose any risk to the plaintiffs. If so, did the occupier use reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'Unusual danger' and if not, was the invitee contributorily negligent? 9)There should have been no question that water was on the"
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter in the death of her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of three grounds: 1) the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to both the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it; 2) the trial judge erred by failing to give appropriate weight to the aggravating features of the case and by overemphasizing the significance of the factors he found to be mitigating; and 3) the respondent was clearly alive to the seriousness of the offences. She had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and had been previously convicted of assault for the same offence. The Court found the respondent had a history of mental health problems, including PTSD, addictions to alcohol and drugs and an abusive background. She avoided social services and did not seek help for the child. The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth as aggravating factors but the court found it did not apply the principle of parity as it had no evidence of past abuse by her previous common law partner; and 4) the judge did not fail to address the principles of denunciation and general deterrence. All of these issues were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused by him in the hope of securing his release from custody on a number of criminal charges. The accused was charged with four offences, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a), uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1) The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact. 2) It would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the accused. He should have had an opportunity to read the recognizerance before signing it. The principles of the Criminal Code were not to punish an obligor but to enforce payment of a financial obligation. The ability to pay surety was a factor to be considered. However, the accused's conduct in leaving the province may be considered blameworthy or reckless if one accepts his version and deserving of some sanction, in the circumstances have concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him."

The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land by the City of Halifax City Council in 1993 amounted to approximately 10 feet of the 30-foot rear yard for retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall commenced in 1994 and was completed in June 1994. In October 1994, the City Council passed a resolution to expropriate the land for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. A hearing was held at which the taxing master reduced the account to $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours of time spent on the file. At the hearing, the solicitor-client account was taxed by the Master and in a decision dated August 25, 1995 he reduced it to $14,000 plus taxes. The Taxing Master declined to award any amount less than $5,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs confirmed. 1)The failure of the City to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the offer one of 'full compensation for interest'. 2)There was no evidence clearly establishing an entitlement to interest on default of payment being acknowledged and accepted by the city. The totality of considerations resulted in the conclusion that the offer was not reasonable. 3)The City did not err in principle respecting the solicitor's account. 4)The Court was bound by the decision of the taxmaster. The determination was not solely on whether the services had actually been incurred but also to the extent to which such costs were reasonable. The protection given by s.13(2) and (3) of the Expropriation Act for an amount in full compensation for the interest excepting compensation for business loss were not attached greater weight to the expert's report."

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appealed a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease to rent a rental unit in the landlord's home and had attempted to sell the property for insurance purposes. The landlord had refused to supply a security deposit and interest to the tenant. At the hearing, the landlord argued that the tenant had failed to provide proper notice to vacate and sought an order for possession by the hearing officer. The hearing officer found that the landlord had breached the tenant's rights by not providing proper notice and the tenant sought possession of the property. The applicant also argued that a hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order respecting the rights of the tenant in the rental unit. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no valid tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord.  2)The hearing officer did not err in law in making the finding that the tenants had not signed a tenancy agreement. 3)The tenants had entered into a written tenancy agreement in good faith. The Hearing Officer did not erred by law in finding that neither the landlord nor the tenant was prejudiced by any error or omission in the written agreement.  4)The tenancy agreement was valid. The tenants had joint tenancy with the landlord in the home.  5)The Hearing Officer was aware that the lease was subject to change.  6)Each tenant has his or her rights under the tenancy agreement, including the right to share in the rent. 7)The common law applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. 8)Section 19 of the Residential Tenancy Act provides for an order of possession pursuant to s.70 of the rental property in order to create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer.

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997.

It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed.

The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The trial judge made findings of fact which negate this claim. The central facts on the terms of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clements was supported by probative evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The central facts were not in force until after the meeting when it was delivered to the appellant. 2)The timing of the meeting was irrelevant as the central issue was not. 3)There was no evidence of undue influence or influence by the appellant or the solicitor. 4)No evidence of negligence was found."

S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The buildings were an eye-sore. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal, that any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any proposed amendment to s. 363 must be construed in a manner that doesnot invoke s24 of The Charter. If the legislators wish to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to this subsection would be necessary. 2)The trial judge made no error in law. The trial judge's finding on the first issue was unnecessary. 3)Any amendment must not invoke Section 363 of the charter. The phrase 'unsightly' in the context of a paragraph deals exclusively with the accumulation of wood shavings, paper, sawdust, dry and inflammable grass or weeds. 4)The use of the value judgement word 'unsightsly' causes an ambiguity in the meaning of the word that calls for the statutory interpretation aids referred to above. 5)The Court was bound, within two weeks, by the written submissions on costs."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence are based on misapprehendions of evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found that the judge's misappreciation of the Evidence was substantial. She ascribed a material error of fact to the organization of which the evidence was based. 3) The trial judge's denial of evidence was not only material but also material. It was a serious issue at a critical time for the appellant and he had never seen anything that could have been considered internally inconsistent. The evidence bearing on his credibility was highly material to that critical issue and evidence which the judge should have realized was not supported by the record. 4) The Court found that a trial judge’s denial of testimony and the failure to give proper effect to it, especially in light of the fact that the appellant had admitted on cross-examination that he had been physically and emotionally abused and that his children had been removed from the home because of allegations of physical abuse and lack of food, resulted in inconsistencies in his evidence concerning his treatment of the children. 5) There was no other way in which the appellant could be viewed as internally inconsistent when the evidence related to the substance and not merely the details of his evidence, is material rather than peripheral and plays an essential part in the judge”s reasoning leading to the conviction."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate for four years. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position in the private sector, which he refused, saying he had a number of things to settle up with. The defendant refused to give him three months notice of termination. He went on to become a senior surveyor for several years, until he became redundant and then transferred to Halifax. Halifax was a good location for the plaintiff, but his employment there was limited to five months notice. He applied to the Federal Civil Service for a position as regional manager in Nova Scotia, but was denied. He claimed the dismissal letter was never sent to him, and that he had no right to ask for it. Dismissing the action for dismissal without reasonable notice, that the defendant had not expressly and clearly stated that the contract would terminate on 30 days notice. This was not sufficient to abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given."

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","HELD: The application was dismissed. In the circumstances, the court found that it was not appropriate to make an order for interim spousal support. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay 40% of the net income of the corporation to the petitioner and that the interspousal contract did not contemplate a variation of spousals support obligation in the event of a material change in circumstances. The petitioner's situation was unchanged from the time the agreement was made."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code.

The accused must: 1) comply with the terms of her probation; 2) participate in any addictions assessment, programming or education, including in-patient and out-patient treatment, as directed by the Probation Officer; 3) maintain any appointments with an addictions counsellor; and 4) participate, in any personal counselling including psychological or psychiatric treatment.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant sought to vary spousal support in accordance with the terms of their Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who was now independent of the parties. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and the parties divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the respondent brought an application to vary the respondent's monthly spousals to reflect the changes in the applicant's debt situation. The applicant argued that the Agreement reached in January 2003 did not conform with the objectives of the Divorce Act and that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either party since it was signed. She proposed that the monthly support be increased to a figure that closely resembles that of the respondent or, $21,864.00 exclusive of those support payments. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The agreement was sound when signed and there were no changes in circumstances. The objective of the Agreement was to provide for an approximately equal division of matrimonium assets and debts. 2)The respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. 3)The Agreement was not unconscionable. The Agreement was based on the principles of mutual desire and took heed to all of the objectives in Miglin (supra). 4)There had been a change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement and the applicant had not met that burden. 5)The applicant was found to have been in debt.  6)The parties had signed an agreement in 2004 which incorporated the terms and provisions of Miglin. Miglin does not permit substitutions for goods and services or for loans or to take out loans. There is no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The agreement was designed to protect the applicant from the burden of law fees associated with the divorce."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime contrary to ss. 354(a) and 355(b)of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b).

When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawsful excuse'. 2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was stayed by the Crown. 3)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on comments made in R. v. Holmes which indicate that a constructive excuse can include all defences the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 4)The court relied on comments of the Supreme Court in R v. (1988), 41 C.C.C.(3d) 497 which indicated that a person can devise a new excuse that they consider a sufficient excuse to excuse them from a criminal liability claim. 5)To abandon the common excuse and abandon it would be contrary to all common law justifications and excuses, and would be in breach of s.7(3) of the Criminal Code, which provides that common law defences are not frozen in time. A Parliamentarian can redefine the meaning of 'excuse"" for example by expanding it to provide new excuses or excuses specific to a particular offence or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses. 6)To use an excuse that is not excuseous, but is also wrong, is not a valid excuse, and is not supported by the evidence that it was abandoned by the court, nor by the conclusion that the evidence supported the decision to abandon the use of the excuse was invalid, and the appeal was dismissed as not supporting the decision of the court as to whether it abandoned the original excuse and abandoned the appeal."

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work and the contract is not incorporated by a specific or general reference. The plaintiffs have failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: Each case was dismissed.  1)The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The evidence is in conflict with the defendant's interpretation of the rotational hours. 2)The single issue of privity is overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. If the plaintiffs had intended to present the case the contract was the whole arrangement between the city, the Association, the contractor and the truckers, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and the city of Regina as well as all the related documents. 3)This case will not turn on the question of privitity. While, strictly speaking, the plaintiffs weren't actual parties, the overall thrust of the arguments in the general document was based on the principles outlined in the terms of the original contract. There is no obligation in this agreement to include all the plaintiff plaintiffs in this rotation. There are no particular arrangement for the purposes of rotation. The plaintiff are entitled to these hours for which they are entitled. 4)The only issue that could have been a critical issue in different circumstances was the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. The Court must decide the case as presented; that the plaintiffs are entitled in damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21/97 and with reference to the Contract between the defendant and the Cityof Regina.  5)Costs in the amount of $17,000 are awarded to the plaintiffs for breach and are awarded in the sum of $18,000 to the trucker.  6)The Court must determine the case of"

c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant Wal-mart Canada Corp. which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion was joined by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant. In the one motion the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. The other motion the union applies for an order dismissing Wal- Mart's motion. HELD: 1) The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Walmart should be dismissed. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias within the documents. 2) The transcript of the radio broadcast is admissible. There is nothing more than allegations by plaintiff in pleading the validity of which have not been tested. The same can be said about the application to the Board (Ex. 1), the decision (ex. 1) and the three newspaper articles (Ex.) 1, 2, 3 and 4. The transcript was not sworn and as such is not admissible and the transcript attests that he prepared the transcript. 3) There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is not a basis upon which to conclude it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. 4) The affidavits filed by the union are not reliable and there is some apprehension that it may be necessary to admit the affidavits of others. However, they are admissible by reason of s. 7 of the Saskatchewan Evidence Act, S.S.664 and s. 673. 5) The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon are admissibles. They are adduced by an affidavit of a former member of the Board with no required reading. 6) The interlocutory motions filed by a union and the comments by a former Minister of Labour are absolutely not unreliable. 7) The same applies to the postings of newspapers."
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007. The Crown alleged that the judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, apply the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) is a valid and effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. However, it is not required that the accused be able to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system'. The respondent has not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations. The trial judge adopted the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining the accused's fitness to stand a trial. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled."

The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;  the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed. HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time. The matter was left to the trial judge.","FIAT. On January 24, 2002, this matter was heard in chambers and the issue was reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time. HELD: The matter was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. 1) Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs. 2) Given the plaintiff's representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiff over-the-conduct of their Counsel or against the influence of counsel directly. 3) The two motions served on them were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by The Queen's Bench Rules; and in his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. 4) Given that the plaintiff was under extreme pressure and stress lately with respect to these files and others and therefore had prepared three motions fairly similar to one another, the court did not believe it appropriate to determine whether costs were to be assessed on the plaintiffs."

Defence now wants further disclosure of information that relate to those important issues. HELD: Further disclosure is ordered. The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.,"FIAT: The Court must guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions' --speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. The Crown will make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for those searches that were applied and how many times; (f) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; and (e) the actual notes of the RCMP officer. HELD: The Crown shall make timely and extensive authorities. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. The appellant argued that the sentence should have been increased because the trial judge failed to adequately address the inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony. The court referred to R. v. Jacquard, where the Supreme Court held that a sentence greater than the amount imposed would allow the appellant to preserve his immigration appeal rights. In this case, the appellant alleged that the sentencing judge erred in describing the events leading up to the offence by failing to address the discrepancies in the testimony of his friend. The evidence of the Crown also conflicted as to whether the accused had assaulted the complainant, using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code. The appeal against conviction was allowed on the basis that the sentences imposed were disproportionately severe collateral sanctions, which was unforeseen by the appellant and his counsel at the sentencing hearing and apparently unintended by the sentencing court."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old male was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for sexual purposes with his hand contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code and 1 year probation with an order requiring him to participate in an approved program or programs for substance abuse and sex offenders.

The Crown requested a sentence of two years less day of imprisonment in addition to the s. 490.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain public places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. The accused's s. 718.01(ii.1) applies since this case did involve the abuse of a person under the ages of 18 years. The Court requested an order be made in s. 487.012, s.487.012 relating to the imposition of conditional sentences. HELD: The Court found that the sentence imposed for the offence was consistent with s.109 of the criminal code and was appropriate. The provisions of s.810 and s.687 of the Criminal Code relating to denunciation and deterrence were not available in this case. S.718.2(ii) applies as a relevant aggravating circumstance as is the fact that the accused abused his position of trust and authority, namely his step-father/daughter relationship, and this is an aggravating condition that the Court is mandated by s.(a) to consider."

The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The issue was whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2) of that Act. HELD: 1)Pre-judgement garnishetes are an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction and renders the garnishthee summons nullity. 2)The affidavit material considered by the Court was not a true copy of the Operating Agreement. 3)Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0% per month compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the operating agreement of September 10, 2001. 4)There were four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act. 5)The affidavits filed by the applicant and the affidavit by the plaintiff satisfied the criteria set out in Bayda v.

Shec Labs (1967 CanLII), which outlined the purposes of various constituent subsections of the s.2 Act. 6)Prejudgment Garnishee summonses are a nullity pursuant to ss. 3.3. The Court was satisfied that the affidavit materialized as a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage and if not, whether it was for an unpaid judgment or alternatively, a claim for a debt or a liquidation demand and not an indebtedness that falls outside those limits. The need for'showing' the amount is obvious, to require the plaintiff or his agent to not merely allege that the indebtedness is owing but to formally attest to the existence of the indebtedity and thereby warrant, not only that the claim, but that it is not provisional or contingent, as outlined by Bayda; and to identify some third party (the 'garnishee') who is alleged to owe money to the defendant that can be attached and applied to"
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied to have access with his four children at a one-hour trial and two-hour settlement conference. He argued that the restrictions placed upon him by the terms of the Varied Corollary Relief Judgment did not protect his children. He requested that the access be reduced to two days per week, two evenings per week and every Friday from 3:30 pm until 8 pm. He also requested that a review of the child support guidelines be paid pursuant to the table amount of maintenance. The assessor determined that the best interests of the children, especially their safety, were at stake because of the father's medical condition, his marijuana use, his driving ability and his use of marijuana. The father requested that all restrictions on his access be lifted, as he alleged that marijuana would lessen his children's ability to drive safely and that his health and safety concerns related to marijuana use had been raised by his children at the time they were denied access. Application to have the access restricted continue granted; the evidence showed that the father took into account and accepted responsibility for some of the circumstances leading to the failure of his children to visit his father. The administration of the marijuana policy in Nova Scotia was also reviewed. The court found that concerns relating to the father’s medical condition and marijuana use were not at issue in this application. As the father had stated in his written response to the previous two letters that he would not smoke marijuana prior to driving, his children would not be able to do so. The evidence did not support his contention that marijuana was not a risk to his children and that if he did not use it, they would be unable to drive less safely; concerns concerning the administration of marijuana were minor and the father was not trying to alienate his children from him."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House.

This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff.

The contract stipulated that the respondent would be responsible for any costs owing to the subcontractor. In the absence of a contract, the respondent could not have entered a contract directly with the principal. The mechanics' lien fund would have consisted of the greater of the amount owing by the contractor to its subcontractor or the 10% holdback fund.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying it for many years.

The respondent has not been paying child support for some years. HELD: 1) The respondent’s application to reduce or eliminate child support is dismissed.  2) It is not uncommon for a payor to have few lean years to reach his or her goals. The court reviewed the criteria set out in D.B.S. v. Kolkata and found that most of the time the respondent did not have the ability to pay the child support he owed. He did not pay child support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. 3) The child remained a child of the marriage until age 59. 4) The father will have few years until he has paid off the arrear. He will have to continue to care for the child for the rest of his life. 5) The court found that the respondent had not shown an undue hardship on himself or the children. The fact that he did not take employment that paid him a considerable amount of money and did not seek employment that could pay him handsomely is in all the circumstances. The father should receive the full amount that, but for his dodging of obligations, would have been available to him when she was alive. 6) There was no undue hardship."

The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the sender did not take the content of the email as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor. The appellant contended the evidence presented by the Crown was rife with hearsay and prejudicial to the appellant's credibility. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence was part of the 'narrative.' The Crown's evidence raised issues regarding the admissibility of evidence, the appropriateness of questions asked of cross-examination, and the impact these matters may have on the integrity and fairness of the trial; the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and was there sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements. 2)The trial judge did not enter a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay and then you can ask him questions.”  3)There was no evidence that the appellant intended to get reaction from the student or that he intended to invite the student to open the e-mail. The only reasonable inference that one could draw was that the sender thought that someone was monitoring what he was typing and that he did not run it as he de-bugged it."

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused, and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one of the break-ins victim to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to do so. Crown counsel argued that although the Crown's intention to use the witness was not disclosed to the defence, the defence was able to take the appropriate steps to properly protect the interests of both the victim and the defence. HELD: The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. The stay of proceedings was out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of the witness."

As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard.

The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.

e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","HELD: The court sentenced the defendant to 24 months in pre-sentence detention followed by a period of probation.

9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appeal from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board was one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis that the issues raised in this case were exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one, in respect of the assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon. Each case dealt with a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire City of Saskatoon..  1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. As with all enclosed shopping centers in the city, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighborhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) The assessment Appeals Committee did not err in law by concluding that abnormal functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type construction but rather a vintage building when design standards were different and building has seen its day. The present method of assessing the common area is reasonable. The Manual is specific that all normal functional obs obsolescences is accounted for in the MAF. Abnormal functional obsolescentence is only accounted for if there is an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used. 3) The appeal related to the 1997 assessment for municipal purposes of a shopping centre in Saskatella. It is one of the appeals heard in conjunction with this judgment. 4) The Court was unable to decide whether the assessment appeals committee erred in law or by mistake. The issues raised and dealt with were exactly same as the issues in another decision, issued concurrent with this copy of the judgment in respect the assessment in Midtown. The same reasoning applies in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon and the same ground of appeal to the Committee fails."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the city owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review the assessment. At that hearing,the Director filed another letter reducing it to $300.41. At issue was whether the City was obliged to pay overtime as required by the Act for hours worked over 32 in a week which had a public holiday (""holiday""). City's application was allowed, and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due orowing to the transit employee. There will be no order as to costs.

The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of the Act. 2)In light of the Caxton decision, the provisions of The Agreement should govern and not Those of the Acts. 3)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement (agreement) it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, which covers Morgan's employment with the City. 4)The agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays are more favourable than the comparable provisions in the Act and the provisions governing wages in excess of 32 hours in any week which has a holiday in it. The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence and a search warrant authorizing the use of two news media camera crews to film during the course of the search. The Crown argued that this action on the part of the police rendered the search unreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter and that the discretion of the trial judge should not be interfered with on appeal except in cases where it has not been judicially exercised. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted at preliminary inquiry stage to conduct cross-examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance. 2) Leave should be left to the exercise of the judge. The discretion of that judge should be not interfered with except in exceptional circumstances. 3) The Crown sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and a stay of proceedings excluded from trial and 4) The accused sought to set off the search warrant on the basis that police officers allowed two newsmedia camera crews onto the premises to film. 4) There was no reason why such evidence should not admissible on an application at trial to set Aside the authorization, bearing in mind the Crown has the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the preliminary inquiry and any conspiracy, or attempt to commit or be an accessory after the fact or any counselling, procuring or inciting in relation to such offences. 5) Leave must be obtained to cross examine. Leave should only be granted when the trial court is satisfied that the conduct of police in the past has been inadmissible. 6) The applicant's counsel undertook to do so and the argument proceeded on the assumption they would, and this undertaking has been complied with. 7) The granting of leave to cross cross-amine should be the preserve of the court. The granting is not a usurpation of a trial judge's function. Where the Crown often consents to the use preliminary inquiry evidence on Charter applications such as this, it is not obvious why it should not apply pursuant to s. 187(7) of the Code.

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","The appellants appealed their conviction of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345.

The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellation's evidence had come into the possession of the appellant after the trial. Some of the documents included correspondence and the notes for presentation to the council of the rural municipality. As these documents were in the possess of the appellant, the documents could have been adduced at trial; and 2)The uncertainty suggested by the appellant that the word livestock is uncertain could not be proven. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments. Cattle are livestock and so cattle are not permitted in the district. The appeal would not have taken place if the constitutional question had been questioned.  3)There was no evidence of any breach of the bylaw by the keeping of livestock. The three bylaws tendered by the appellans did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial as the basic planning statement, the zoning bylaw and the bylaws dealing with keeping livestock were not. The bylaws and bylaws relating to keeping livestock and their relevance to the issues were supported by the evidence."

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs, who were associated in the practice of law, filed an application for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs submitted that RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. They alleged damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and breach of the contract. RBC counterclaimed damages for 'excessive delay' and alleged damages in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The application to dismiss the proceeding was dismissed with costs of $60,000 to the defendant. 1)The delay was entirely due to RBC's negligence. The defendant was not responsible for the delay. The delay was inordinate and inexcusable. 2)Ruling in the action with respect to the claim on the basis of the delay of three years was not unreasonable. 3)The Court must take into account the position of the plaintiff himself and strike a balance between the parties. 4)RBC must show that the delay is not inordinate. It is not sufficiently extreme to justify a presumption of prejudice. 5)The court must consider the role of the defendant solicitor in determining whether the matter should proceed to trial. The Court must also consider the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the slow pace of litigation. 5)Individual defendants are not to be held to account for delay in the development of a cause of action unless it is clearly foreseeable and demonstrably foreseeable, which, in turn, creates a prejudicial effect on the defendant's ability to proceed. 6)The defendant is not to blame for delay. There was an understanding that the matter would not proceed until it was decided whether to pursue the action on its own or with the assistance of outside counsel. 7)The delays are entirely due in part to the negligence of RBC. This understanding was held to be a form of acquiescence and the matter was allowed to proceed at trial."

The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans. Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had applied for interest relief in the amount of $1,752, but was found to be unable to pay the loans. The balances owing on her student loans remained outstanding. The Bankrupt applied for an order directing that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student student loans. HELD: The application was granted. It was not difficult for the Court to compel the Bankbrupt to pay a significant portion of the debt, say half of it, because it would be a continuation of financial difficulty that prevented her from paying the loans and would also protract the burden of these loans in manner inconsistent with the overall objectives of the BIA. The Court was satisfied that the applicant had acted with good faith. The debts date back 13 years. She made her proposal in 2000, and completed it in 2005 and was no further ahead. Another five years have passed. Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy.

The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","HELD: The motion was granted. The court ordered that the accused be provided with full disclosure in usable format.

The court reviewed R. v. Laporte and found it appropriate to order the disclosure to be provided in a usable format so that it would be available to the defence in a reasonable fashion. The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in reasonably accessible manner.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence had a serious personal injury offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. The offences were violent, with the accused striking the officer in the head and threatening the officer with a gun. The officer fired his taser at the accused, striking him in the face. The impact was minor and the accused did not show any of the usual signs of violence that are often associated with offences of this nature. The court found that given the accused’s lengthy criminal record and the fact that he had 67 prior convictions, four of them assaulting peace officers, this offence was a serious one. The offender did not engage in conduct that would endanger the life or safety of either officer. Given the fact the accused had a weapon at the time of the offence, the accused was approximately eight feet away when he was cornered by the police and the officer, and there was no attempt to try and strike either officer, the court found. The evidence showed that the accused engaged in conduct which endangered or was likely to inflict severe psychological damage on the officer and that his conduct inflicted severe psychological harm. The Crown requested a penitentiary sentence as it had concluded that the predicate offence of this type of offence was beyond the realm of possibility or beyond it. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The sentence was increased to 12 years in the amount of time served on the firearm charge. The Court found that the Crown must prove a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour, that the offence was not a serious injury offence and that the evidence did not support a recommendation that he be placed on a life-sentence list for dangerous or long term offender status. The predicate offence is a serious bodily injury offence as defined by s.752 of the Criminal Code."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After the officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. At the conclusion of the trial, the Crown argued that the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal advice. HELD: 1) The lack of Prosper warning does not mean the respondent’s waiver was not valid. The case is almost directly on all fours with Prosper. The police did not take the opportunity, as required, to give the additional information to the accused. The respondent agreed to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent waived the right. The evidence falls far short of proving that the appellant was frustrated or frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. The learned trial judge was required to address the issue of whether the respondent had a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer once he has had that reasonable opportunity. 2) The holding-off requirement on police in this case flows logically from the two implementation duties. Making the police hold off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee until a reasonably opportunity to reach counsel has been provided to the detainee is consistent with the underlying purposes of s.10(b). The receipt of the breathalyzer certificate in this instance was a direct result of the breach and because of that it must be kept out, as it would be unfair to proceed with the trial with it going in, given the circumstance. The certificate is excluded. 3) In reviewing the evidence that was before the trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. The holding off requirement flows from the 2 implementation duties of the appellate court. The trial judge concluded that a warning was required in this matter, and none was given to the appellant.

The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Court does not know who to believe, and he is not guilty subject to the principles restated in R. v. McKenzie (P.N.) (1996), 141 Sask. R. 221 (Sask. C.A.) (from R. V. Rose (A.L.) (1992), 20 B.C.A.(BC CA), 20 C.D. (Ontario)P.S. Kolenick, The accused bears no onus in this case. The Crown did not have sufficiently credible evidence to prove non-consent beyond areasonable doubt. The only contact the accused had was for defence of the accused. The complainant's father advised that he had heard a thump from the bedroom when the two of them were in there alone. He had not been in the bedroom at the time.HELD: There was nothing which undermines credibility. The evidence should be regarded as having less value, sufficient to support the conviction of the defendant. The credibility of material witnesses needs to be considered. The accused is not a person who believes he is committing common assault because he did not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and was always in possession of the car. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. HELD: The claim was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of the husband's wife. 1)Personal ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of the registered registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership without regard to unregistered claims. 2)Credit Union claim enforceable since the applicant's wife transferred ownership from her own name to her name. 3)The claim of a Credit Union was enforced as against that of the opposing wife."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner access to the family home and supervised access only for the respondent father. The Court held that the evidence suggested that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it not in the best interests of the children and that their father had only supervised access to them. The respondent took the position that the allegations of sexual abuse were not credible and that there was a risk of harm to the children. Therefore, the Court applied the Risk of Harm test, holding that: 1) the petitioner had provided factual evidence as background to her opinion, much of it expressly disputed by the respondent or implicitly accepted, that evidence relates to significantly dated matters and 2) the respondent's evidence of irrational fears and anxiety resulted in the conclusion that he was prone to these sorts of things and that his psychological well-being was at risk of abuse by the father. Implicit in this conclusion was the inference that the petitioner was being irrational and that the father was causing the children to become afraid of him. The court considered all of the allegations with care and caution. The petitioner's evidence was that there were discussions between her and the respondent as to what she was observing and that they both believed the respondent was scratching not masturbating. The evidence did not support the idea that increased contact between the parties would in fact be beneficial. The issue of whether the petitioner should impose a minimum supervision access order on the father had not been weighed in the totality of the evidence. The father had previously been granted access by the petitioner on two occasions and on three occasions during the relationship. The mother had also brought an application for variation of an interim order to restrict the father's access to supervised access as a result of allegations of addictions and pornography. The applicant had also filed an application to have the primary residence of the parties be with her and supervised supervised access by him every other weekend. The application lacked the evidence that there would be an adverse effect on the children if the father were to be granted access. The facts did not show any of the possible adverse effects that would result from allowing the father access to his home. The harm test clearly cannot meet the objective of a fair and balanced evidence set out in the report on Family Law (L.A.B.). The court applied the 'risk of harm' test to the claim that the applicant's allegation of sexual assault was unreliable and that it could not be taken to mean that the alleged acts were motivated by irrational fears or anxiety or that"

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner and the applicant agreed in 1994 that they would pay $3,000 per month plus support for their son Michael and their daughter Karin. Since then, the petitioner has reduced the monthly support to $1,500. The husband is currently suspended with pay. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is reasonable and reasonable. There was the uncertainty of the husband's future job and income. There is uncertainty as to what he will require if he does decide to enter the workforce this fall. Also, there were uncertain prospects for the wife's future employment. 2)In this case, the respondent was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $ 1,000.00 without at least consulting the applicant. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received in April and in April. 3)The petitioner was not allowed to unilaterally trim the $1 million he paid in 1995 to 1,600 for each of the months September through December 1995 and even those were irregular and not on time. 4)Spousal support was reduced to 1% of the total amount paid in 1996 and 1% in 1996. 5)The court allowed the petitioner to have her costs of the matrimonial home sold and the proceeds from the net proceeds were distributed. 6)It was premature on this application to change the amount of spouse maintenance requested at the suggested guideline figure. There are too many uncertain factors surrounding either party's future jobs and income and uncertainty asto what the two children will do about future education. It was premature to apply the amount proposed in the guidelines."

The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the application. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(5) provides a number of factors in favour of a application and which the Court can consider in deciding whether the presumptions favouring an application found in Rule 6 are not applicable. 2) The Court considered all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to by the parties and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties. The Court was not satisfied the initial application could be converted to an action at the time of this application.  3) Rule 7 of the Companies Act provides for commencing allegations of 'oppression' by an application. There can be no question that an action as intended by the defendant will significantly increase the costs of determining the initial issue in these proceedings; which issue is 'the legality' of the defendant's enforcement application. 4) Rule 5 provides a set of steps the Court could consider in the event of an alleged default. The first step is to determine whether the important witnesses can be quickly ascertained. The second step is whether the parties can quickly ascertain who their important witnesses will be. If it is not, then the separate action for damages commenced by the plaintiff will be consolidated into one action pursuant to the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure rules. 5) The application will be of no consequence to the plaintiff if the proceeding is not successful. The plaintiff will suffer damages if the action is converted to another action.  6) The presumption outlined in Rule 7(3) provides that the first step will be to determine the extent to which the defendants will suffer estrangement from the plaintiff."

HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable.

7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT. The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules in April 2009. Their claim was with respect to a construction contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. The dissolved corporation counsel for the plaintiffs then asked for a further order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs and the court that Orion Morgan could represent his corporation at the upcoming simplified trial. Orion Morgan was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011, as a person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than 2 months have gone by since the affidavit was provided to counsel for counsel forthe plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of the plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished. Orion is to make herself available for the purpose of cross-examination if the plaintiff corporation still wants to file her affidavit in support of its case. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of a defendant realtor, who was also a realtor. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home. The defendant sold the property in 1998. The plaintiff had intended to buy a wood-paneled home. There were cracks in the wall, a gap in the foundation, some loose pebbles in the attic and some insects in the house. The owner claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the tenants. The parties' agreement to have the building permit issued by the rural municipality satisfied all necessary conditions, including the payment of a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The realtor and her husband had misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, induced her to purchase the home, and in some cases, provided evidence that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site.

The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim.

d_1993canlii6612.txt,"On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal. He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company. The defendant, STC, admitted to dismissing the plaintiff without cause or notice in breach of its contract of service with him. In consequence the plaintiff obtained a judgment for damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles (the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law. Was this error? Even if it were, and it was, it was not in substance at least, too much can be made of it. The severance terms of the plaintiff's contract with STC were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service and were accordingly adjusted accordingly. There was no suggestion that the plaintiff had any obligation to mitigate his loss, given the extensive past service and the fact that he had incorporated the company for the purpose of providing accounting and related financial services, a salary of $110,000, and the annual value of the CEO Benefit Package provided by the Crown to the plaintiff at the time of his dismissal."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued against her in relation to a grow operation. The judge quashed the warrant, finding that the warrant was invalid and thereby a presumptive breach of her Charter rights. The respondent's acquittal resulted from a review of the warrant by the JP. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The trial judge failed to apply the proper standard of review, which is that the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were three or four vehicles ahead of the plaintiff, it would still be a haphazard guess to determine that the tail lights were on or working. The plaintiff also argued that she had not been able to establish that her injuries were caused by the accident. Application allowed; costs in the cause of the action to be set aside. Although there was some evidence of the defendant's prior conditions which could contribute in significant way to her current health complaints, there was no 'air of reality' to the defence.

e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession and the other charge against him was stayed. Brooks applied for relief from forfeiture pursuant to ss. 20(4) and 21(4). The Crown argued that s. 19(3) contravenes the guarantees contained in s. 11 of the Charter and s. 12 of Charter. The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to the possession of the marijuana in the trunk of the Lincoln because it was being used for the commission of a designated substance offence. Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. The Court rejected the Crown's submission that s19(3)(c) is a form of cruel and unusual punishment, and concluded that it was not necessary to obtain a standard of punishment available to all convicted. It was concluded that the essence of Brooks' application was that she was innocent of any complicity in the offence and that the property was not likely to have been used in the commissioning of the offence. HELD: The Lincoln was forfeited to the Crown. The appeal against the forfeiture order was dismissed. 1)Solemn property is not appropriate in a general sense. It is appropriate to have a standard in society, such as that of punishment and deterrence, available only to those who are deemed innocent of all complicity. 2)The proceeds of the sale of stolen goods are not to be recovered by the Crown unless the proceeds are obtained in some other way. 3)There was no evidence adduced at trial to rebut Brooks' assertion that the Lincoln was not used in connection with the designated substance offense. 4)The Lincoln was owned by the owner. It had not been questioned that she had an interest in it. 5)The interest of a person who has been convicted of a specified substance offence is forfeitable. The proceeds of all proceeds are to be paid to the Canadian Red Cross."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission.

The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. The respondent was not an arm of the government but rather a fully dependent institution of higher learning. The collective agreement in effect in 1987 provided for the appointment of a full-timer as a professorial position in the faculty at a substantially lower salary than he had been receiving, though still receiving his pension. The agreement changed in 1988 for the purpose of setting the normal retirement date for the member to be June 30, 1988. The applicant had indicated in his affidavit that he would retire in September 1988. Counsel for the applicant suggested that s. 33 of the enabling Act could indicate governmental control, but no such control was proven. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was found not to have a greater power to control the conduct of the university as determined by the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA). 2)The only real relationship between the government and the university was that the collective agreement which provided the respondent with certain funding was voluntary and not mandatory. 3)The collective agreement was not subject to the Charter as it did not interfere with the administration of the University. 4)The applicant was awarded all compensation for his actions, which were entirely consistent with the agreement. 5)Allowing the application would be tantamount to setting up an alternative tort system in the area of private discrimination. 6)Costs were left to the trial judge."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. The father takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care.HELD: 1) The third party was the grandmother. She was the biological mother of the boys. 2) The issues must be determined whether the grandmother is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children, what parenting arrangement would be best for the children and if so, what child support should be payable by the father. 3) There was no difficulty in determining that the grandmother was a person with sufficient interest. The designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’�s Law Act, 1997 for a person of adequate interest status. It is only if grant the grandmother the appropriate status that she can apply for custody. 4) The father was granted access to the two boys. 5) The grandmother was granted supervised access. 6) The parties were awarded joint custody with the primary residence being with the grandmother; if the grandmother received an order for supervised access she was granted the same access as the father and the parties would have. The parties could have obtained an order to have the children in their respective custody by obtaining substitutional service on the grandmother or by obtaining an order under s. 7 of the Child and Family Planning Act to have access with the children."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act. The plaintiff argued that SGI had prior knowledge that he was a victim of a motor vehicle accident and that his benefits were terminated because he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: SGI's termination of benefits was appropriate and the plaintiff was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident resulted in his suffering of soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine and resulting conduct on October 1 and thereafter.  2)The plaintiff's benefits under the Personal Injury Protection Plan were terminated pursuant to ss.185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of s. 185. 3)Saskatchewan Government Insurance was not entitled to terminate the plaintiff’s benefits under s.184. The court found that under the terms of this judgment, the plaintiff could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy in Yorkton if he was receiving a full, rather than partial income replacement benefit. 4)The court was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The application was opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor 2301042 Dominion Bank. HELD: Leave to amend was granted. The amendment was reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice in the sense which is relevant to this application. The amendments will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. As for prejudice, the application must be on the question of whether there is any prejudice to the respondent or intervenor as a result of the appellant raising this issue now by way of amendment rather than in the original notice.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that denunciation and deterrence were the dominant principles of sentencing. The Defendant had been a high profile contributor to a pedophile website during the time in question and had been charged with possession of child pornography. He submitted to counselling by a professional person who had been trained in sex offender treatment and that he was prepared to participate in psycho forensic psychiatric/psychological evolution. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years. 1)The defendant did not have a criminal record. He abided by his release conditions over the past 2 and half years, had no previous criminal record, was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lived on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. 2)There was no evidence to support the conditional sentence as the maximum sentence in the circumstances. 3)There were mitigating factors, such as the fact that the defendant had no criminal record and did plead guilty, along with the other material referred to in the pre-sentence report, which did not support a conditional sentence. However, the limited information available that he would not endanger the community if one wereimposed."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.",The defendant filed an interim summons requesting the court to issue a supplementary summons. The summons was not issued because the defendant was away on education leave and had not responded to the summons. At issue was whether or not the claims should be issued pursuant to s. 7(4) of The Small Claims Act. HELD: 1) The court declined to issue the summons on the basis that it was not ordered to issue. The supplementary summons request was not made aware of the length and complexity of each claim and the issues were not decided on a case management conference date. 2) The applicant failed to provide notice to both the Attorney General and the Saskatchewan government and it was clearly outside of its jurisdiction. 3) The application for declaratory relief by the applicant was dismissed. 4) The claim was intended as a test case and the return date for the Notice contemplated in s. 10 of the decision was set in consultation with the office of the proposed plaintiff’s solicitor.  5) There was no evidence that the applicant would be able to vigorously defend his claim or that it would be in breach of contract. The applicant should be given an opportunity to argue the issues.

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The husband was 52 years old and unemployed. He qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. The wife had provided for their three children since the separation. HELD: Relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousal support. FIAT: The petitioner paid the respondent an annual sum of $6,000. The court concluded that relief should be given but in-the circumstances it must not take spousAL support. The petitioner had the means to pay $500 per month. The Court noted that the respondent does not need financial assistance. He is the registered owner of the farm land and receives the entire rental income. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the wife brought into the marriage. In total there is a section of land one quarter of which contains the matrimonial home. The home is one of the few remaining pieces of land left to the husband. The Matrimonial Home is another source of revenue and the petitioner has de facto possession of the land. The rental income is 33% of his present income of $630. On that amount, the Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a payment of $442.00 a month. Any payment order would not jeopardize the welfare of the children."

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest. It did not find that the petitioner had rebutted the allegations made against him. It ordered the respondent to return to Court with an order requiring him to access the petitioner.

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the incident was captured on security videos, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The Crown also established that the wounds were consistent with those inflicted by the accused in the video."

The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample as necessary to enable a proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that the 'ride along' had no duties and was simply with the accused. He chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of theride along nor even that there was a ride along. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused did not intentionally try to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s 254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. The police officer was aware that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District and the accused was in the vehicle with 'ride-along'. He testified that he observed the vehicle swerve to the right and then to the left more than necessary. He blew three times in all. The last call came when they were at the pines just north of Prince Albert. After that the officer slowed down. He did not inform the accused of anything. He placed the accused in the rear seat and waited for the ready light to come on. He waited for another set of tests. He then waited for one of the ready lights to come back on. When the first one did not come on, the accused blew outside the mouthpiece of the vehicle. He said he was sorry for the inconvenience but was happy to be doing that. 3)There was a discrepancy between the testimony of the accused and that of the officer, but the court accepted the evidence of the complainant. The complainant had not told the officer that he had three beer the whole night. He had been in a rush and was not in any way prepared to provide sample of breath for a breathalyser. The promise to appeal served on him was not valid. 4)The officer was properly instructed in his assignment that he should not forget to give proper sample as he was driving at speeds over 100 km/h.
