He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","The accused, 43 years of age, and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville, pleaded guilty to five theft related charges. The total amount of money involved for all five counts exceeds $64,000. He was sentenced to four months consecutive on each count for a total of twenty months incarceration in a provincial institution. restitution was provided for the five victims in the amounts as detailed in Exhibit 3.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S.17.1 (the “Farm Security Act”) provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Act. HELD: 1) The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again. Given the expiration of the notice of intention on March 1, 2009 and the respondent’s failure to initiate any action, once the clock began running again it expired within the day. 2) The registration of the mortgage must be ordered discharged as requested for the reasons outlined in para. 13 above. The presumption in favour of ordinary meaning is rebutted by evidence derived from other statutory interpretation tools that another meaning was intended or is more appropriate in the circumstances. 3) The Limitations Act requires debtors and contractual obligees to commence enforcement proceedings within the applicable limitation period, failing which the right to enforce is lost."
3_1997canlii15044.txt,"The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident. Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.","An infant was waiting for a school bus to pick him up outside a school. The bus pulled away suddenly causing some of the children to lose their balance. The infant fell to the ground and immediately felt the bus run over the lower half of his right leg. No surgery was required and the infant was advised to return to his pre-accident activities. The wording in Civil Procedure 63.19(1) requires that the filing of the Agreement with the Prothonotary is mandatory because of the use of the word'shall' and this was not done in this case. As the Agreement does not comply with the rules, the solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of any contingency arrangement and without regard to the contingency."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the roadside demand had not been made forthwith and that whether or not the accused had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test was pure speculation. The trial judge found that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver’s seat is deemed to have care or control of the vehicle. He found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the appellant did not establish an abuse of process as a result of the fact there were three trials. The only thing the accused added to his viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This did not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences under the Criminal Code arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction. Appeal dismissed; the appellant takes the position that the jury's verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant appeals her conviction and raises numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds does the appellant take the position the jury’s verdicts is unreasonable. The only evidence heard on this application is that of Constable Towle of the R.C.M.P. detachment. 2) The Court reviewed the evidence which the jury heard at this trial and found with the highest degree of probability that; 1) there was no mechanical defect in either vehicle that could have caused or contributed to the accident. 3) There was no evidence of impairment. The Court found that the appellant had not been drinking alcohol at all on the day of the accident and that there were no signs that she was impaired."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",The students' union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to s. 222(d) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The students' Union sought to overturn that order. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and found that the president of the Students' Union had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals were dismissed with costs. The Court of Appeal held that the President of the Federation was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and served as managing editor of the campus newspaper and served term as member of the Student Affairs Board. He was involved in the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. The Federation argued that the Chamber judge erred in finding that the student union had 'imposed its own preordained outcome' by endorsing the referendum result. The Chamber judge concluded that it was not necessary to transplant into the Act the case law developed in the context of elections for legislative office and to consider that body of law to be a controlling effect. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the student body's decision to reject the Federation's decision.
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). An initial question was whether the trial judge's decision quoted above reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. The trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment.  1) Absent expert testimony interpreting a particular reading, court cannot use the reading to come to conclusion as to what quantity of alcohol was consumed or what effect, vis-à-vis impairment, such consumption of alcohol had on the particular accused. The evidence as to the accused's pattern of driving, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and the odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. 2) There was no error in the judge's observation that the accused was the complete focus of Constable Coe's attention and could not see any unexplained delay."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board reversed. Husky appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Finance Act. The issue raised by Husky on the appeal was the interpretation adopted by the Board of the word 'published' as used in s. 5(1)(b) of the Act. If, as the Board found, the purchase of the drawings was an independent transaction, was it exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(2)(f) of The Act? 1)The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 2)Husky appealed to the Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the Board's definition or the broad interpretation. It is probably not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by HSU. The Board determined that an audience of one is sufficient. This eliminates having to focus upon whether the audience is sufficiently broad which as noted, is anomalous when one considers its application to a technical paper. The definition adopted does give rise to the artificiality noted earlier i.e. determining whether technical papers are produced, distributed or available to a sufficiently broad audience. The appeal is allowed.  2)The board determined that the word ""published"" was intended to speak to purpose and not the extent of the audience. There was no absence of evidence such that the Board could not reasonably reach the conclusion which it did. 3)If, as it was determined, the purchaser did not pay tax on what is referred to as 'Documentation charges', was it exempted from tax on an appeal of this nature?"
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. 1) The trial judge did not err in his reasons. He did not refer to the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused; (ii) the reasonableness of the accused's belief that he was being threatened; and (iii) the proportionality of his response. 2) The Court did not fall into the trap of preferring the evidence of one over the other, but rather drew conclusions regarding what happened based on the whole of the evidence. The Crown appealed. The court found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The appellant's reasons do not reflect an inconsistency. 3) While it is true that the appellant's mistake of fact was reasonable, he did not address the fact there were two officers present. He noted that Cst. Lariviere 'at no time felt endangered, and at no time took any steps such as pulling out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation', he noted that the force used by Cst.'Liere in reacting to the perceived threat had been justified. 4) The appeal judge found that even if the appellant had been afraid, he would not have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. 5) The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the appeal judge had misinterpreted and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because it placed more weight on some portions of the record than others."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This was an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The City and CUPE had met their duty to accommodate and accommodate Mr. Kivela as an employee of the City. The fact that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. The requirement of building up seniority as a truck driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the petitioner because of his disability. 2) The tribunal erred in law in finding that the city had discriminated against the petitioner on the basis of being the person with the most seniority. There was no inference from the tribunal that the petitioner was being discriminated against. 3) The evidence showed that most of the casual employees who were hired as truck drivers in the City's jurisdiction (outside workers) did not have the physical capacity to work as truck driver. They were simply hired as temporary employees and then assigned to a tandem truck. 4) The respondent was awarded $8,902 for leaving his employment. 5) The court found that the tribunal was not in error in its decision to accommodate the petitioner."

When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008, related to alcohol and weapon possession. The accused was given his Charter rights. He was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to duty counsel. His response was muttered and hard to interpret but appeared to be that he was simply too drunk to understand the Charter caution given by the police officer. The Crown sought admission of the accused's inculpatory statements to the police officers. HELD: The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial and he was not focussed on the present and his immediate right to have counsel then and there. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty to make it impossible for the police to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us.' 1) Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. 2) The accused exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding of his basic constitutional rights under s.10(b) of the Charter. The police would have been aware of the misunderstanding and as result, were required to clear up any misunderstanding the accused may have exhibited about his rights. 3) There was a low threshold here with respect to the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. The more important issue is the capacity of a person to understand their Charter right to be informed of their rights and to be able to call a lawyer. 4) The Court reviewed the video evidence and found that the accused was clearly and fully aware of his rights at the outset of the detention and that he chose not to avail himself of immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of John Black when he went to court. The Court did not believe the accused wandered off from his fundamental fundamental right to get advice from counsel to make an informed choice about whether to exercise other rights."

All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. The phrase in question was ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen.

The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

If this was established then it would be clear that the statutory limitations could not be nullified. 4) The only documents to be considered on an application under Rule 173(a) are the notice of motion, the statement of claim, the particulars furnished pursuant to demand, and any document referred to in the claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of his claim. 5) The first paragraph of paragraph 13 and 14 was struck out. The second paragraph 15 was struck. 6) The three parties' claim for contribution and indemnity was advanced independent of the plaintiffs claim against the defendants. 7) The third parties did not establish that s. 34(2)(a) of the fire prevention act, 1984 was not nullified by Rule 173. The only document considered on this application was the notice and motion, which required the applicant to allege prima facie claim which, if established, would entitle the defendants to take proceedings against them. This is analogous to the case at bar. The essence of the allegations are relevant in respect to the contention that they have not acted in good faith, if this is established then, if so, should the entire Third Party claim be struck out?"

4_1994canlii5226.txt,"The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. The matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. The University of Regina was to make monthly pension payments directly from the pension plan to the applicant. The applicant retired from the university effective June 30, 1993. He elected to receive monthly payments for life with a guaranteed period of 15 years. He would like to receive her vested interest as a lump sum benefit but did not consent to this. Based on a comparative history of their two families, the applicant expects to outlive his former wife and on her death he expects thereby to regain the remainder of the pension asset. The parties apply for a further clarification of their intentions. The court prefers to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order, and consequential declarations and directions. Paragraph 14(a) provides that the applicant is to receive a 'a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in this order'. The order of December 19, 1985 does not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly, the 40% share, having vested in the applicant, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, Russell Zacharuk. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal."

The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that an adoption plan would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the agency lost confidence in the child's parenting skills and by June 1995 was hospitalized.

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. 1)The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is slight departure from normal behaviour, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the pattern of alcohol intake is a slight impairment of one's ability to operate a motor vehicle. 2)The accused had not taken any particular notice of the accused prior to the accident and had not been driving erratically. The road had been clear and the sun was not a problem in driving. 3)There was no evidence of braking by the accused at the time of the accident, no indication of alcohol consumption, no alcohol being ingested within one-half hour prior to an accident, and blood serum was analyzed rather than whole blood."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","This is an action by Redhead Equipment against Standard Transportation Services and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by the defendant. The trial lasted one day. Standard did not appear at the trial nor did it enter a defence to the allegations. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The facts did not satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)There was no specific contract with regard to the repair of the leased vehicles. Although there was a specific contract between the parties, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard. There was no evidence that the repairs were authorized for Standard.  3)The plaintiff's claim was dismissed on the issue of the unpaid invoices. The plaintiff's evidence did not establish that either the defendant or the defendant had notice of the payments, or that there had been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors. The evidence of Duda was that the payments were made either under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where a specific purchase order number was supplied. 4)Costs were also dismissed. The Court was not satisfied that the facts of this case satisfied the Court. The facts of the matter do not satisfy it on a balanced of probabilities. The defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, Redhead, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1, 1993, until February 11, 1994. The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. It would be unjust not to make an award. 5)The defendant was prepared to assume a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on its trucking contracts.  6)The Court was clear from Cox's notes and Duda's evidence at trial that it was understood by the parties that the obligation to make the lease payment would be contingent on Standard's ability to make money on its trucks. 7)The evidence of Cox and on review of the documents themselves was not conclusive. 8)The court was clear in Cox's evidence that he did not know how the repairs had been authorized. 9)The defendants were not liable for any liability."

In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","HELD: The court found that the holding of trial was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. The court ordered that the respondent father be responsible for 56 percent of s. expenses, which, by agreement of the parties consist of non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The petitioner and the respondent were ordered to provide the other with copies of their income tax returns, including all schedules and partnership statements, no later than June 15, 2007 and by the same date in each year thereafter. The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983 and that if he had overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month."

1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for trust funds. Additional information demanded by the defendant could be obtained through production orders against third parties but also through belated efforts by Bawolin. HELD: 1)The Court ordered the defendant to pay solicitor/client costs to be taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing byBawolin, still, he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. The applicants had been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the medium security Saskatchewan Penitentiary until they were transferred this year to the minimum security federal prison where they were both placed in housing units designated for individuals with mental health issues. They were both serving their “life” or “eligible” sentences and had been charged with the disciplinary offence of being in a housing unit other than his own. HELD: The application was granted. The Court’s jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the correctional services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in their own prison will be subject to disciplinary charges. While the applicants were seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the prison service which do not impact their residual liberty, these remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement which provided for the maintenance of their matrimonial home. The husband contended that the agreement was unconscionable, unduly harsh and fraudulent. The wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so as to increase the maintenance provision and at the same time retain the asset division in her favor. Both parties acknowledge that the maintenance award is of such a low amount that it is unconscusable and unnecessary to vary the terms of the contract or agreement as the court has confirmed to them that it was not made for taking into account the almost inevitable costs of disposition."

This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendants for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The former wife sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. She argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support. She also asked the Court to review the amount of child support paid by the Respondent going back to when the parties first separated and asked that he be ordered to pay any deficiency between what he did pay and what he should have paid. The previous variation order was a consent order and both parties agreed to its terms. The order was approved by the Court and was not appealed.

There was evidence before the trial judge upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","At the close of the Crown's case, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994, alleging it breaches s. 11(1) and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: There was no prohibition order in effect within s. 27 of the Fisheries Act. The Crown had conceded that the accused was not a member of the Executive Council. There was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused’s licence and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a licence at the relevant times. The issue was whether the accused had the authority under s. 13(4) to revoke a licence because of a specific conviction. The accused was never properly served. Nor was he served by registered mail, in which case it would take effect on the delivery date or on the date the signed post office receipt is returned to the sender. The prohibition is not personal service by any definition.  1)The Minister of Environment was not the person charged with the offence of exceeding the angling limit. He acted in compliance with that licence and there was no valid section 27 revocation or prohibition in place so far. 2)The prohibition takes effect at the date of the letter being received. 3)The accused was neither properly served nor served personally nor by registration mail. He was served by a registered mail in which he would have no authority to act on behalf of the Minister.  4)The Court found that the Minister was not properly served and that the prohibition was void ab initio, having been made without authority. Section 27 does not give the Minister the power to revoke when a person contravenes the Fisheries Regulations. The Court found there was a prohibition order within the meaning of ss. 27 and s. 8 of the Act."

The trial judge did not consider the definition of weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. He founded the conviction solely on the basis the push dagger was concealed on the accused person. HELD: Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered. On the second element of the offence, the trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the 'weapon' was concealed but that it was not a weapon as defined in s2."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary an order for maintenance for her daughters. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted, does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the matter. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been found to be unilateral, unjustifiable and is clearly wrong.  2) The Court found that the issues in this appeal can be reduced to the following: 1) Was there an agreement in 1997 to pay specified or other maintenance? 2) Was the father in arrepentant and is retroactive maintenance payable to September 2006? 3. Were the daughters 'children of the marriage' within the meaning of the Divorce Act? The Court held that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding the daughters were not in deficit of support and that there would be no order for retroactive support."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, entered into an oral agreement with Super Save Disposal (Saskatchewan) Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save'), in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks. When required, it would also provide shop supplies and parts to effect those services. In the absence of an express term in the contract, which stipulated a price to be paid for goods and services, the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price for the goods and service. However, there was no evidence as to when the contract commenced, nor of how much time elapsed, nor do know how many invoices may have been submitted, nor did the plaintiff's expert take the time to explain why he felt that particular repair service took particular amount of time. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $1,550.85. The court accepted the plaintiff’s argument regarding estoppel by convention and found that a fair price was awarded to the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid. The amount sought was $10,902.32. Even if this evidence had been led, the court would still have reservations in accepting this argument, because it had heard no convincing evidence of detriment reliance."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 for an order setting aside the default judgment entered against the Town of Mahone Bay on February 7, 1996.

Dismissing the application, that a default judgment is a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. HELD: The default judgment was set aside. 1)Civil Procedure Rule 3.04 is permissive and the Court could order otherwise, find the position of the defendant did not meet the test for the court to strike the default judgement under the provisions of Civil Procedure. 2)The default judgment should be set aside because it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy through his trustee. His application was opposed by the creditors and by the trustee. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s. 172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 1) The bankrupt failed to produce proper records and to assist the trustee to the fullest. More generally, he reports that he has been abusive and belligerent.  2) He should be able to comply with the conditional order in the amount of $8,000 in addition to surplus income. 3) Having carefully considered all of the facts, the existence of multiple s. 173(1)(a) grounds, Burroughs' personal circumstance and his ability to pay, the Court readily found that s.173(2)(d) does not apply to the bankrupt. The bankrupt's actions in the five years prior to bankruptcy did not constitute an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a conditional order.  4) It would be unfair and unjust to allow the bankrupt to receive his discharge without making a sizeable contribution to his creditors. The fact that the bankrupt sold cattle in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2007, when he advised SCU of his intention to sell cattle in order to raise cash, he did so by mistake. The trustee's report did not report on this fact, consequently the Court was left to form an opinion based on the Statement of Affairs and the Claims Register."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him. There was no basis to interfere with the decision of the judge.

c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties failed. The employer advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. The Board refused to sign a contract or implement it and sought clarification of the retroactivity of the wage rates. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The employer was a merchant. His products were priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. The decision to allow the graduated employees to receive their back pay was not patently unreasonable in that it denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect to the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. 2)The issue of retroactivity was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions and arguments and would not have been easily ignored. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would have been rather meaningless. 3)The decision was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).

As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a ten-year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year SOIRA compliance order.

Therefore, in our view, Parliament clearly intended s490.013 to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together. 2)The appellant was found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for more than one offence.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, S.C. 1990, c.21 (the “Act”) and the “Health of Animals Regulations” resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the judge was a fine of $69,000 allocated amongst the fifteen counts. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s.734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed. 2)The sentencing judge did not take Alsager's rehabilitation into consideration.

b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","This is a divorce proceeding between the parties. The parties began cohabitating in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 2004. The parenting and support issues concerning Ella have been resolved. The issue for the Court is whether Tristen is a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). HELD: The threshold for a finding of parental status is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the one who is in the place of parent. This was an important decision - Mr. Delorey did not'stand in place of a parent' when this decision was made. He stood, or was stood, aside."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. The tractor was owned by an Alberta company and the plaintiffs, presumably husband and wife, were at all material times residents of the Province of Alberta. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a highway in Saskatchewan. The plaintiff sustained a right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiffs' statement of claim accords with Rule 139 and goes, perhaps as far in particularity as the state of health of the plaintiff, who is still under treatment for her injuries and special damages for same as such are not now fully ascertainable. Both the first and second reasons just stated have merit. The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery and the defendants may require their own medical examinations of this plaintiff by request to the plaintiff or court. Rule 164 enables a party, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, to demand better particulars and disclosure of documents. This Rule contains at least two major purposes: first, to assess the merits of settlement discussions; and secondly, to properly prepare for discovery. In this particular case, both the defendants right to deliver notice in writing to the plaintiffs requiring the plaintiffs to provide, 'a further and better statement of the nature of their claim... and, better particulars of any matter of which particulars should properly be given and such notices shall clearly state the particulars required.' Unlike Rule 139, which has as its main purpose the provision of sufficient particulars to enable a defendant to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiffs' claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence, Rule 164 has a different, but similar, scope. Rules 164 and Rule 164 enable a party to demand the same, but smaller, amount of documents in greater detail then mandated by Rule 139."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that [J.C.M.] provide to the petitioners copies of his tax returns for 1999, 2000 and 2001 and his notices of assessment for 2001 and 2002. The parties have been unable to reach an agreement with respect to child support and accordingly have proceeded to trial. Retroactive child support should be fixed at $1,500 with costs to be paid within 10 days of receiving the receipts. HELD: 1)The court found that the child care expenses incurred in this case did not meet the requirements set out in s. 7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act and accordingly were not warranted. 2)The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he was ordered to pay 59% of the costs of his music program commencing in September 2002 and continuing on the 15th day of each month thereafter to December 15, 2003 at which time retroactive s7 expenses are warranted. 3)Reasons for retroactive order [QMLA 393]Rule 608(2) of Queen's Bench Rules provides that costs are in the discretion of the court. In this case ongoing support was not an issue. The main issues related to the s. expenses and the retroactive support order were mixed and as such there was no order as to costs."

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT.

B-3 and an instrument appointed receiver of the registered owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for an order with respect to a sale of the real property. HELD: The application was granted.  1)The jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, s. 1978, cL-5 not brought forward in the new land titles, 2000, S.S. 2000, C.L. and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders. 2)The material satisfies that there are no other interests that will be adversely affected if the order is granted.

2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties is custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. Matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation has largely been divided between them to their mutual satisfaction, with the exception of few items to be dealt with by way of court order. HELD: 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for the children now is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children have the most stability and where they receive the most structure and support in their educational endeavours. The court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of those children. The Court must also look at the increased costs of shared custody (9(b)) and any extraordinary expenses which are relevant (9). 2) In making an order for custody pursuant to s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act, the court must also take into account only the interests and needs of the parties. The child support awarded by s. 9(b) contemplates broad discretion in determining the proper award. 3) It is in the children's best interests that they be in the joint custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.' and that they reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. There is no evidence that the children will suffer from language difficulties as a result of sharing custody. 4) There was no evidence of any other reason why the children should reside primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner was not persuaded that it was in their best interests to be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon. 5) It was also in their parents' best interests for them to reside in each of their parent's homes. 6) The children were exposed to the negative influence of the father's behaviour towards the children. 7) The respondent was not aware that there were three schools in Clareshorn, a town of 4,500 to 5,000 people. The evidence would be at best an estimate of the future cost of the new arrangement and necessarily lacking in precision."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee by failing to instruct the employee on how to unplug a receiving pit. The employee died shortly after entering the pit. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the employee suffered serious injury at work is evidence that the appellant did not ensure his health or safety. The Court of Appeal's approval of these remarks does not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect an employee. The accused must prove beyond reasonable doubt that a prima facie breach of the duty of care has occurred. Once it does that, will the onus shift to the accused to show on balance of probabilities that he showed due diligence or took reasonable care."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. HELD: The motion for summary judgment was granted and the claims of both the plaintiffs were dismissed. The parties should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court's process. 1) There are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by the plaintiff, Maria Johansson. 2) The defendant, GMCL, has passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim has a real chance of success. They have failed to do so. 3) Both “Fraser River” conditions are satisfied and GMCL should be entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who have already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. The plaintiff has failed to pass the first hurdle of presenting its case. 4) The parties have not proven that there is an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved. The only issue that could result is whether the parties intend to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision. In short, the parties to the contract intended to extend benefits in question only pertained to the plaintiff. They failed to establish this genuine issue for trial. 5) The defendants are entitled to summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by both the plaintiff and the defendant. 6) The plaintiff is entitled to seek contribution from her and her insurer should the defendant be allowed to proceed with their claims."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT: The applicants seek an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: 1)The applicants are hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. The Town Council has taken certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. These include tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. The applicants are opposed to the development and take exception to what has transpired to this point. 2)The Town Council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of municipal government. The proposed hotel would be connected to an existing public facility. This project has been strictly confidential to the applicants. 3)The applicant is a hotelier who operates 5 of the 6 hotel and motel properties within the Town's boundaries.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The applicant municipality appealed its decision to strike its claim under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25(1)(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982, arguing that the federal government had breached its obligation to provide equalization funds to the province. The applicant municipality sought a declaration that the province had breached s. 36 of the Act. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. 1)The court found that the respondent municipality's pleadings disclosed a reasonable cause. The Court found that pursuant to Civil Procedure rule 14.24 the respondent's proposed interpretation of s.36 was not justiciable. 2)The respondent municipality was not in breach of its constitutional commitments. 3)The Court held that, in the context of this appeal, the Court of Appeal should not be hesitant to strike such claims. 4)The issue for the Chambers judge was whether pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules s.14.25, the appellant municipality's plea did not disclose any reasonable cause for action. It concluded that they did not. 5)The appeal was therefore a generalized expression of dissatisfaction respecting the province's failure to take appropriate steps to alleviate this disparity."

Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","This was an action by the plaintiffs for damages for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit.

The court was satisfied that the oral agreement was enforceable but in the absence of an enforceable agreement, the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment.  2) There was no indication that the commission structure was negotiable. 3) The Court found that the defendant had not indicated that he intended to re-negotiate the terms of the agreement. 4) The issue of the 10% commission was not raised in the discussions with the plaintiffs.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month."

That being so, a reasonable cause is disclosed and the quote test is not met.  2) The plaintiff must establish that the words spoken or written were published on lawful occasion, that is one 'fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency' and that there must be some mutuality of interest or a reciprocal of interest between the publisher and recipient. Reciprocal of interest is essential. It must be shown that the publisher had some duty or interest in making the communication, and those to whom it was made had some interest in receiving it, or at least he or she was acting on behalf of someone who had such an interest. The statement of claim alleges malice. The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant. 3) There may be merit to the defendant's claim but it cannot be dealt with in this application. The affidavits filed by several individuals, including the defendant purportedly filed would not constitute defamation in law even if proven to be true. The plaintiff fails to plead the means by which the statements were made or the dates when, and locations where they were made, and deprives the defendant of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. 4) The statements of claim is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and otherwise an abuse of process."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd.

The Credit Union took the position that it should be re-imbursed either as Quantum Meruit or because it has been unjustly enriched or because the payment of property taxes has created a constructive trust of the $6,227.88 in Gari. 2) In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider the priority provisions of s. 36 of the Personal Property Safety Act. The trial judge found in favour of Gari for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail. 3) It is common ground that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. If that issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to look at the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari against the bank."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on the charge of impaired driving on the basis that two breath samples taken after the arrest of him were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The learned trial judge failed to consider the contradictory evidence available to the police officer in forming the objective grounds for the demand sufficient to require additional objective information, such as an objective and subjective component. The existence of reasonable and probable grounds entails neither an objective or subjective component and the issue was not pursued at the hearing of this appeal.  2) The trial judge erred in attempting to balance the observations of the officer which tended to indicate that the accused was impaired by juxtaposing them against other observations which would indicate normalcy. The officer made no note of improper driving when she first observed the pickup truck, nor when she pursued it and it pulled over to stop. Defence counsel had given verbal notice of Charter issue at prior appearance but elected not to seek voir dire. The Crown did not seek to call any evidence in support of its Charter application. 3) While the trial judge did not give sufficient consideration to other observations made by the officer, she did not fail to consider other more relevant evidence."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused was found guilty of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in steroids only. He was sentenced to 7.5 years in custody and prohibited from applying for parole before the expiry of three years. During the course of the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The accused applied for a new trial on the basis of the discovery of the documents and alleged a breach of s. 11(d). The trial judge granted the adjournment and granted the application. The court reviewed the documents in detail and found that there were 27 additional documents not previously disclosed in the combined forces database that could have affected the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The Court found that the Court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that it is not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could affect the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available to the Court."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiffs were in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was operating a police vehicle at the time of the accident. At the time, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening hours visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The plaintiffs were travelling at a high rate of speed when they were struck by the defendant's police vehicle, which was stationary at the intersection. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light and the police vehicle was approaching the intersection when it turned, without signal light in operation, in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the defendant was not qualified to express an opinion.  1) The evidence of the lay witnesses convinced me he was in the field in which it is sought to have the witness’ opinion. 2) The Court found that up to the time the motor vehicle collision was occurring, the defendant’s headlights were in operation on the plaintiff vehicle and the plaintiffs’ vehicle was burned out. 3) There was not presented evidence which established the officer was capable of expressing his opinion in his own capacity. 4) The court found that the exhibits were in “near perfect condition” which would be sufficient for an opinion in this case. 5) There were no issues with the destruction of the exhibits. There was no evidence that the witness was not present when the accident occurred."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The respondent was awarded judgment for $1,945. The petitioner had some assets which could be shared but her share would only be $2,000.00 or so as he was quick to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. Five of the children lived with her in the home. The matrimonial home was divided equally between the parties already and direct no further division or appraisal of those properties. There was an accrual to Edward's pension during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at $8,358.00 for a total of $9,890.00. There were certain personal property, vehicles, etc. which were subject to income tax and the petitioner assumed debts of almost $5,000 which must be credited to him, leaving a credit to the petitioner of $1.945 for the total. The court accepted the claim that the petitioner's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property. HELD: There was a judgment in favour of the petitioner and an award for costs of $4,000 plus an award of $5k for the sum of $6,000 to be awarded to the respondent.  1)It was, prior to the 21 month marriage, the long term family home of Sharon Lang and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. 5 of those children live with her. Such a division would mean that Edward Lang for his 21 month involvement in the family was being given one-half of the only asset the family has. They would either have to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home to a far more modest home or to rental accommodation. 2)The respondent was employed by the public school system and had a permanent job. He had the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems. He would be even better off if he were to award the $25,000 against the property."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a driver and driver's helper. He was dismissed from his employment without notice. The plaintiff contended that his hours of work were 7:15 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., that he was under surveillance and that he took longer than authorized breaks, consumed alcohol during the work day and submitted claims for overtime which were unjustified and basically dishonest. The court found that the defendant was justified in dismissing the plaintiff for his failure to abide by the company's overtime policy. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified and the plaintiff's claim for damages for wrongful dismissal was dismissed. 1)There was no reasonable excuse for the dismissal of the plaintiff. The failure to distribute the rules, in writing, in this particular case, is crucial. The onus is on the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for dismissal. 2)The breach of company rules is serious. The implications of breaking the rules in question are sufficiently serious to justify termination; and whether a reasonable excuse exists. 3)The defendant's failure to comply with company policy related to breaks and overtime is a cause for discharge. It is apparent from the testimony of the drivers who testified that they regularly stopped at the Seabreeze Inn during their Hubbards route to pick up merchandise and to unpack it for the customer. There was no evidence that the employees had been warned that they would be terminated if a rule was breached. 4)The plaintiff's employment was terminated without notice in 1988. The defendant has satisfied the onus with respect to six of the factors."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. The central issue in the father's application was not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the gift of a condominium held jointly by his parents. The father contended that his mother made a gift to him that failed. He sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of the estate. Alternatively, he sought party costs. Allowing the application and ordering costs in favour of the father, who is now acting on his own, will bear their own costs. HELD: The court ordered the parties' costs to be paid out.  1) The court did not award costs against the father.  2) The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. 3) There is a public interest in ensuring that the executors of a deceased's estate are required to stand by their 1999 will, including the provision of the condominium to his son, which was not 'estate litigation' but rather litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. However, the defendants have accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 1) The plaintiff was the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) and was an active participant in the harassment himself. 2) The court found that the plaintiff had not been defamed but had been a victim of the impugned wording of the plaintiff's grievance. 3) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. 2)The Court of Appeal reviewed the transcript of the trial and concluded that the statement made by the accused was not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings against the appellant.  3)The appellant's statement after the voir dire was not voluntary and could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was 19 years old at the time of the accident and lived in the city. He was charged with dangerous driving causing death. The Crown argued that a sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in the community rather than in a corrections facility. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre. 1)The Court was concerned with the principles of general deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation and rehabilitation of the accused. 2)The accused's actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to pay attention to the situation resulted in the death of his passenger. 3)The Crown sought a sentence of imprisonment for 90 days and an 18 month term for probation.  4)A troubling factor in this instance arises from the fact that the accused was driving a motor vehicle on the streets of the City of Regina in a manner dangerous to the public. The Court was of the view that sentencing guidelines should be set out in s.742.1 of the Criminal Code."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The defendants applied for an order severing the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs alleged that Wolff, along with Sparks, set up a competing business through their corporation, Advance-Tek Consulting, to compete against the plaintiffs in the scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) grants from the Canada Revenue Agency. Wolff was bound by a confidentiality and non-competition agreement with the defendants. By sharing this information with the other defendants, Wolff has breached that agreement and his contract of employment. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages was dismissed. 1)The defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality and disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain their position in the business of SR&ED consulting. 2)The plaintiffs' counterclaim against the defendants and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 3)The court reviewed the Queen's Bench Rules and granted the order to strike these portions of the claim.  4)The Court considered the impact of disclosure on a settlement between the parties. The court found that the plaintiffs’ application had merit. It was appropriate to exercise their discretion in their favour and grant the order. 5)The defendant’s application to strike portions of its claim was dismissed because there was a clear severability between the threshold of liability and the consequential issue of damages."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with accessing and sharing child pornography. The accused was a member of the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) Unit. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation of the accused. HELD: The Court found that the accused had in his possession child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4.1) of the Criminal Code. A search warrant was issued and the accused was taken into custody. During the course of his investigation, the accused requested an opportunity to consult with counsel. The first officer testified that he was certain that the Internet traffic was destined only for the red tower computer and that the physical MAC address of his computer was G.U.I.D. The second officer testified as to how the system could be used to identify packets of information. The third officer testified about how the Internet could be a bridge between two networks. He testified that there was an encryption system used to access the Internet, specifically at least one computer that was encrypted with a program called True Crypt. He also testified that it was possible for the Internet to be accessed by someone accessing the same server, the same Internet address and obtaining the same information from the same physical location. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex. The only thing that could be done was to look at the physical address and name of the person who was accessing the Internet and to see if there was any evidence of child pornography on the Internet. The Court concluded that the evidence of the third officer was insufficient to conclude that the second officer was a computer expert."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties attended a settlement meeting and reached an agreement on seven issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit, including Exhibit A. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. 2) The parties did not reach agreement on all issues. There was no agreement that any agreements reached at the meeting could not be used in evidence. If the division of family property was not settled by June 27th, either party may seek to have the issue of continued possession reviewed upon 14 days notice. 3) The petitioner was to receive interim spousal support in the amount of $500.00 per month for the first two months and $400.00 for the third month. 4) The Court concluded from the material before it that while the parties may have reached agreement on a number of issues, they failed to reach an interim exclusive possession of the family home. The Court directed the Local Registrar to remove Exhibit A from the court file. 5) The court concluded that the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of these issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a judgment was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Expert evidence is admissible provided that the expert is qualified and his or her testimony is necessary or useful to assist the jury in making factual determinations. 2) Although the appellant made the calculations in P-16, we cannot characterize his testimony as 'expert opinion' evidence in this case. 3) The trial judge should have specifically directed the jury on the limited purpose for which the expert's testimony could be used as well as the weight that might be given to it. Accordingly, the tabulation was not objectionable because similar calculations could have been made by counsel or the trial judge. 4) The appellant limits her challenge to the 'future loss of earnings' component in the amount of $337,130."

Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to clause 15.10 of the lease quashed. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws Properties. The tenant vacated the premises and the Landlord sought to quash the award. HELD: The arbitrator was not correct in concluding that he had authority to award damages. That is beyond the scope of the arbitration clause because it is not dispute about the clauses or provisions of a lease. There is no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from a Landlord/Tenant relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of the leased lease. The principles of waiver and estoppel apply as against the Tenants. 1) The standard of review is correctness with respect to the interpretation of the clauses in the lease and the amount of damages. 2) It is not patently unreasonable for an arbitrator to rely upon the actions and statements of others to his detriment. 3) The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited arbitration clause. It does not provide that all disputes between the parties are to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses of the leases. However, the decision of a consensual arbitrator must give to those clauses an interpretation the language will reasonably bear. If the interpretation is not, the award is immune from judicial review. 4) It would be inequitable for strict rights to be upheld where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. 5) There was no evidence that the Supreme Court of Canada intended the widened scope of judicial review to include an award of damages to the Tenant. The court reviewed the cases and concluded that it was not necessary for the court to interfere with the award because it was within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The Court reviewed the issues of responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required and whether insurance should have covered the damage. 6) The Court concluded that the arbitration clause was a limited arbitrator and that it did not provide a jurisdiction to deal with disputes arising out of the landlord/tenant relationship but only those disputes involving the clauses. 7) It was not appropriate for the Court to intervene if there was an error in law. 8) There is a wide scope for curial deference and for judicial restraint in the determination of whether the award would withstand judicial review, but there is a limitation on the amount and scope of jurisdiction."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux.

At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes.

There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(2) and with driving while impaired by.08 with a blood alcohol concentration of.08 in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court found that the accused's admission of impairment was reasonable and that the Court was not obliged to rule out every other possible cause. The Court concluded that there was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. 1) There was no dispute that the officer's belief was honestly held and subjectively valid. 2) The absence of any smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol did not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that he had alcohol in his body. 3) The Court held that the grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and therefore, the evidence thus obtained should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). 4) It is the Court's view that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused in this case paint a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by the alcohol. The officer was not asked more questions or conducted more thorough investigation, nor did he have any other explanation for his actions.  5) The court found that it was reasonable to conclude that the most obvious cause was impairment by alcohol.  6) An assessment based on this criteria would also favour the admission of the evidence.  7) It was not necessary for the Court to terminate the investigation. 8) The officer's reasonable grounds for arrest and for the breath demand were objectively sustainable.  9) The presence of any indicia commonly found in impaired drivers does not necessarily undermine finding of reasonable and probable grounds based on the observed indicia and available information viewed in totality."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as he found that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that had prevented her from reporting to work.  2)Cajon acted well within its jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the appellant had not frustrated or fundamentally broken her employment contract. 3)The Court found that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajaon,as the appellant, had not breached its employment contract, had acted within its obligation to permit its employees access to the workplace. 4)Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to the circumstances of this case."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order refusing to appoint Dr. Miller a court expert and refusing to order him to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part as provided. 1)The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert's opinion is clear to the trier of fact who will have to assess the weight to give the opinion taking into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help them discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. 2)To allow interrogatories to usurp this function, without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote. 3)The details required by the Rule ensure the factual and emotional impact of an opinion on the subject matter of the action. 4)The appellant is entitled to have these answered, even if this requires the doctor to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant during this period of time. The appellant is also entitled to answer interrogatories seeking to determine his opinion at the time he treated the appellant as to what would have happened if he had not treated him as he did. 5)The chambers judge considered this issue of opinion and I am satisfied he erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answer an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that 'Dr. Miller cannot be compelled to provide opinion evidence simply because he was a subsequently treating physician to Mr. Madore even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment.' 6)The opinions sought by the interrogatories in this case were opinions that Dr.Miller may or may not have formed since he treated him or may now be able to form if he reviewed sufficient factual information and prepared, opinions similar to those an expert witness may provide, he is not required to answer these interrogatories calling for such opinions."
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. The court has agreed that the Metis of Northwest Saskatchewan hold an existing and historical Aboriginal right to hunt moose and deer for food which had not been extinguished prior to 1982. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. 2)The issue on this appeal is whether the appellants are Indians within the meaning of s. 91(1) of The Constitution Act, 1867. The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity is not triggered by it. 3)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples' right. The trial judge did not go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution but must meet the Sparrow justification test. 4)The question of whether the appellant's aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights does not extinguish that right but only curtails method of exercising it which is, in any event, universally disapproved by the holders of the right."

No authorities were available that considered its provisions. 3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document. 4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.,"FIAT. This was an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment. The main ground of the application was that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Queen's Bench Rule 19(1) of The Queen’s Bench Rules. The defendant deposed as follows: 2. That on or about March 16, 2004 received a registered letter containing the Statement of Claim in the within action. 3. It was my belief and understanding that the receipt by way of registered mail did not constitute proper service on myself as required by the rules. 4. As such did not take any steps to defend the action believing proper personal service would be made on me in due course. 5) In my opinion however, this Rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 18, the relevant provisions of which are as follows; 18(1)(a) Subject to the express provisions of any statute or regulation and notwithstanding any rule respecting service, the court has discretion to validate or set aside service of any document. 6) The application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the circumstances under which the default arose and disclosing defence on the merits.

Any delay in making the application must be explained."
2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007. That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director. It appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals to this Court against the findings. HELD: The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and her discounting of the value of the rug and clothing went a little too far in her opinion. The damages were $862.50. The Court also discounted the property damage claims on the basis that the furniture's value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items. She allowed $712.50 for the furniture, $75.00 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing. The amount of damages awarded was reduced to the amount originally awarded. 1)The Landlord testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was impossible to believe that she could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. Having heard and assessed her as credible, it was hard to believe she would have engaged in such a tactic. 2)The two versions of the facts were as far apart as they could be. My task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging, had I not been able and inclined to rely on the bylaw inspector's findings. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The condition was very clearly depicted in photos. 3)It was impossible not to believe the landlord, had she actually resorted to this tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away the mould."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit as provided by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Her counsel appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: 1)The death benefit was 50% of the deceased's actual gross yearly employment income. The 'weekly income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 of the Act is a different statutory creature than the 'incomereplacement benefit' in Division 4. The ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis.  2)The 'income replacement' in s.146(1) was not the same as in s146(5) and was calculated on a monthly basis. 3)The deceased's net income was $51,343. SGI was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 4)There was no requirement to use the formula in s136 to calculate the deceased spouse's death benefit. The death benefit is 50% if the victim's gross annual employment income and the maximum yearly insurable earnings for 1996 and 1996 was the amount calculated in accordance with the same formula. 5)The loss benefit is one-half the 'weekly Income Replacement Benefit' as it is referred to by the Act and the ordinary meaning is 'payment is made on a daily basis'. SGI is entitled to $301 per week payable every 14 days or lump sum of $336,211.45."

HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff, West Central Air Ltd., submitted the lowest tender. HELD: The contract was awarded to Nielsen Ashdown. An implied term of the contract was that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give any of them an unfair advantage over the others.

Enterprises Ltd. used reliable independent sources for its information. 1)Curniski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.  2)An implied term was that, in every case, the person who invited the tenderers agreed to treat them fairly and to give no tenders to accept. 3)The implied term is fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist together in the contract."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. The father was apprehended by the Ministry when the children were born. Although the mother was represented, the father was not. Although H.H. and N.O.S. were the subject of a consent order for six months, both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requested a 6 month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. HELD: 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care.  2) The father proposed that he will continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems. The Minister filed a book of documents marked Exhibit P-1 with each document tabbed therein. References to tabs refer to this exhibit."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The accused was assessed as a high risk to re-offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. HELD: The accused is remanded to November 12. 1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions comprised of 12 assault related, 12 sexual assaults, and one common assault offence involving someone under the age of 16 years. There is both a subjective and objective component to his belief that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault. 2) There is no triggering event that can be required to engage s.810.2(1) of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the accused's fear that he will commit a serious sexual assault is reasonable in the circumstances of this case. The Court reviewed the binder of materials filed as Exhibit P-1 and relied on the Crown's own personal experience in reviewing and dealing with matters of this sort. The only issue to be determined is whether the accused’s belief is reasonable. 3) There was no evidence that the accused had a prior history of violent or sexual offences. There was an objective component of his beliefs that must be established by the Crown. 4) The Court was unable and refused to make generality of that sort.  5) The Crown indicated that it was only looking for one recognance and it did not matter under which section they obtain it. The court was unable to review and compare and contrast the documentation that was prepared relative to the accused in that case, the Correctional Plan Reports (CPRs) filed with the Ontario Court of Justice. 6) There were no triggering events that could be expected to occur in the context of the defendant’ s.810.1 Recognizance application.

HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial.

The Court found that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against you and was unnecessary to establish your state of mind which was adequately established by your own evidence and your summation to the jury. This defence was fully and fairly put on the jury which chose not to accept it. Since the accused gave evidence on his own behalf, it cannot be said that you did not have a fair trial."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. She now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash on her chest. HELD: 1)The statement of claim does not disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, the Dow Chemical Company, although there is a causal connection between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff is assuming that the corporate entity, DowCorning Corporation, was created for a specific task by the defendant and that in the carrying-out of that task they were in reality one and the same entity. 3)The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. As a result, that defendant cannot be served with the statement of claims within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. 4)There is no causal link between the defendant's duty to disclose the risk inherent to breast implants and any wrongful acts of DowCorporation should be treated as being those of The DowChemical Company. 5)The statements of claim do not disclose an actionable wrong. However, they do state that the defendant is at law responsible for the liabilities of the company. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party, but more particularly by any culpable conduct on part of that defendant. If fault is found to be directly attributable to The Dow Chemical, then there is causal connection."

They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely.

The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The court found that the plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and the plaintiffs and Anne Ens 35% of loss. 3) Considering all the facts presented in the case, a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the Contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith."

b_1998canlii971.txt,"The respondent grocery store was charged with selling tobacco to a person under the age of 19, contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant was acquitted of selling tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.14. The trial judge also concluded that the onus was on the appellant to show that its employee was duly diligent rather than whether the accused had been duly diligent. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge found the tobacco access act was ultra vires the Legislature. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act and 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation', and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. Where an employer is charged in respect of an act committed by an employee acting in the course of employment, the question will be whether the act took place without the accused's direction or approval. The accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent commission of the offence and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system. 2)There was no conflict here in this sense between the federal and provincial legislation. It follows that the two Acts can operate side-by-side and the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Act unconstitutional."

He argued that s. 9 of the Charter was infringed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in finding the appellant had reasonable and probable grounds for a breathalyzer demand and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringe. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction was restored and the appellant's right to retain and instruct counsel was reinstated.  1)The Court held that, in the context of Ontario's R.I.D.E. program, there was a common law authority in police officers to detain anyone against their will for questioning, or to pursue an investigation. 2)The wording of s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act is broad enough to authorize random stops of motorists by police officers. While s. 119 of the RCMP Act is inconsistent with ss. 7 and s. 8, it is a valid and constitutional legislative enactment. Comparable provisions in other provinces have been held not merely to impose a duty upon drivers but to provide peace officers with corresponding authority.

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan, Victim Services Branch, brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","The accused was charged with second degree murder. The hearing on his interim judicial release was held before the Provincial Court judge. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for judicial interim release on the grounds that his presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown applied for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1)Whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for a judicial interim detention; and 2)Whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the Youth Criminal Justice Act decision. HELD: The accused was granted judicial interim custody pending his preliminary inquiry. The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender's Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction in the Province of Saskatchewan is the Court of Queen‘s Bench; and whether the youth court judge in a Provincial Court has jurisdiction.

Section 33(8) of the Act provides that a judge shall be judge of a superior court in the province in which the accused is charged, but no other court, judge or justice, may release the young person from custody under that section. Section 13(2) provides that if it is an offence under s. 469 of the Code, a youth justice court judge shall serve as judge of the superior Court of justice in that province, which is the province where the accused will stand trial. The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial releases on an offence of this nature is limited exclusively to the Provincial court unless another act of the parliament of Canada was to limit that jurisdiction. Whether the Youth court judge has jurisdiction in this case is a separate issue. Section 3(1) provides, “if it is a charge set out by s469 of that Act, the judge shall also be a judge of that province in the case in which it is made, and the youth is charged before or after the accused has been ordered to stand trial,” and Section 469 (compelling appearance of an accused and interim release) apply to the detention and release of young persons under this Act.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused is charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused is guilty of mischief. 1)The mens rea required for s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code, is objective foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that there be an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. This is simply not believable. 2)When an individual intentionally strikes another in the facial area with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. However, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was very qualified in her denial of the assault. 3)The Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s.268 of the Code. The evidence is that only Ms. Fayant was present in the house. There is no suggestion that she broke the window. The officer testified that she gave him a backhand."

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","This was an application by the applicants for judicial review of a decision of one of the respondents, The Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Licensing Commission.

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was granted.

The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office [Brabant] rendered to Cowessess.

This is as a result of the request itself and it is not fair. 2) There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of the legal services they provided during the time they were involved in with the applicant. The test is less stringent and is based on fairness. The applicant is still sole practitioner and the court has the discretion to abridge the time if satisfied that, 'it is in the interest of justice to do so'. 3) It is not in the interests of justice for the applicant to extend the time beyond the 30 day time period provided by the Act. There is prejudice to the applicant both as an individual and as a lawyer. The amount of fees charged, the threshold set by Klebuc J. and still applicable in essence, is lacking here."

However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction.

Dismissing the appeal, that even though the complainant must have been mistaken as to the number of Friday nights she was sexually molested, such a misconception on her part, under all the circumstances of this case, does not destroy her credibility.

Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail.

The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner or his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. Q.B.G.

There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The respondent’s amended application sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order.
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: In this application, one of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) There is no evidence of irregularity or evidence on the peripheral points which will lead a chamber judge to conclude that there is a sufficient issue for proof in solemn fashion.  3) The court reviewed the specific evidence contained in the several affidavits filed in respect of this application. It is important to note that the test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of the testator and the validity of the will. If there are suspicious circumstances that cast a measure of doubt on one or more of these legal requirements, such circumstances will affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.",This was an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The respondent had been a long term recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. His application was denied based on failure to provide requested information and the respondent continued to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27th to September 7th as period covered by the order. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the respondent had the right to ignore decisions of the Appeal Board and that the function of the Board was meaningless.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities.

In this case, the defendant deposed that he did not have control of the proceeding. 5) The Court reviewed the procedure to be followed on an application under Rule 173. The Court found that the defendant was entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. The defendant was acquitted in the criminal proceeding on the ground that he was not in control of his own affairs at the time of the assault. He was not asked to cross-examine the Crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in the civil proceeding. 6) The burden of proof was not on the defendant to prove his self-defence but on the facts of the case."

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate.

After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her 5 year old son to the respondents. The child and his mother were placed with the appellant and the respondents pursuant to Family Support Services Contract whereby the Harrises were to'spend individual time with' the appellant in supervising and teaching her to properly care for the child and provide for his needs. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court's role is not to determine broad social issues but instead, to determine what custodial arrangement is in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in paragraph (i) of s.8. The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for her child and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time. Simply put, the trial judge was correct in his statement of the law that his duty was to determine the custodial arrangements was in the best interest of the child."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","HELD: The court granted interim relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, and The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The court ordered an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favor of the petitioner.  1) The petitioner had established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children and should pay spousal support in the amount of $1,500 per month. 2) Given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, the court ordered these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. 3) There was no dispute that the petitioner and the respondent had cohabited as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she was a'spouse' by virtue of the definition in the Act. 4) The fact that one is not the biological parent of a child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. 5) The Court ordered the respondent pay to the petitioner the sum of $500 for the period commencing September 1, 2009."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The deceased single mother, who was unemployed and had no income, appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children were not entitled to any additional dependant child care benefits.

2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004, the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the action. HELD: 1) The plaintiff and the defendants were entitled, with the consent of the defendants and the board of directors, to the initiation of derivative action by the plaintiff. The matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. 2) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to have counsel for 609. He was appointed for that purpose and is obliged to so instruct 609's counsel. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 3) The questions posed by the participants in their written submissions demonstrate confusion and misunderstanding as to the nature of the actions and consequently of a party's rights and responsibilities. 4) Some of the misunderstandings have their genesis in the pleadings which recite the plaintiff to be Henry, capacity which the defendants admit. The plaintiff is and was 609 and Contrary to Brehon's position the action remains derivative one in which the action proceeds for the benefit of the plaintiff against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. However, no evidence of quantum of legal fees was provided and the merits of the documents were difficult to assess at this early stage. These concerns still pertain and without prejudice to renewal of the application for cost reimbursement when the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice can be allayed, the costs remain with Henry."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","An application for an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant.

An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005, had been a basis for the search. The affidavit contained incomplete and misleading information and the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the warrant. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the Court is satisfied that the accused's own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The Court found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias and that the learned justice of the peace ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue the search warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. 2)The application was dismissed. 3)The court found that the application was not pre-ordained and that there were reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home."

The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The only remaining issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. An employee who submitted a bid for a food services contract in competition to her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of her employment contract. The plaintiff was entitled to no more than nominal damages. The court awarded $500.00. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. Although the defendant had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, he still employed at the time he made his proposal. He did not have the experience suggested by Fortney but he did not consider that to be confidential information or a trade secret. If there had been electricians available through the union hall they could have undertaken the work being performed by Sullivan. The claim against PCS was dismissed. The only issue left was whether the employee breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff and whether he breached his contract of employment by submitting his proposal to the defendant. The courts have held that merely planning to establish competing business does not ipso facto violate the duty. The position of the defendant when he submitted his proposal is almost identical to that of the plaintiff in this case. The defendant knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of plaintiff. He knew nothing about profit margins or profit margins. He had the experience suggesting that Fortney would not be able to provide the plaintiff with the same benefits as Fortney."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. They now seek leave to appeal that decision. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. 1) The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the Applicants on appeal. Nonetheless, the Court is persuaded there is enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave. As matter of first impression only, arguments (a) and (b) summarized above in para. 13, appear to be of particular interest. Given the decision of the Queen's Bench Chambers judge, it is not in the Court's interest to delay the appeal. 2) The Court is cognizant of the fact that there is a longer time frame for an appeal than there is for a decision to be struck for delay."

The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.

The accused blew a test on the approved screening device and was taken to the RCMP detachment where his blood alcohol content exceeded.08. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel. 1)The accused made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. 2)The officer was justified in assuming that he was satisfied. 3)There was no evidence that the accused opted not to contact legal counsel and thus waived his rights under s.10(b) of the Criminal Code. 4)It was clear from the evidence from the accused that, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol, he did not seek assistance from Legal Aid. 5)Although the accused testified he was being sarcastic, the officer did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult another lawyer. 6)The destruction of video evidence provided by the RCMP did not have an effect on the accused. 7)On the evidence, the accused did not appear to indicate that his legal advice was inadequate. 8)The absence of a cell phone at the detachment did not give pause for thought in that it could have been used to provide an opinion or to provide a warning. 9)An opinion could be written on the cell phone but it could not have been written on it. 10)The Court was not satisfied with the accused’s call to Legal Aid but was satisfied that he had been given the dumbest lawyer available.  10)On reflection, the Court concluded that it was not necessary to provide the accused with a Prosper warning.  11)The evidence did not show the accused indicated that he intended his reply to be sarcastic. After this, he made no further request to call another lawyer or call his wife.  12)The use of a phone book and access to phone was not an issue in the circumstances of this case.

She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in February 1988. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was 72 years old at the time of the accident and suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Her injury was a whiplash injury which had substantially resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. The trial concerned the level of disability to which the plaintiff was entitled. HELD: The Court awarded the plaintiff $18,000. 1)The proper level of damages was the proper amount for the plaintiff to be awarded. 2)The plaintiff's loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident was adequately compensated by the non-pecuniary damage award. 3)Costs were taxed."

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time.

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer.

They had a profit-sharing agreement pursuant to which 10% of gross was paid to the defendant, 10% to Harnish as boat share, 26% to Murphy and 26% for the balance of gear and after expenses were deducted, net profits would be divided equally among the four. 2)The evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or second in command.

HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the major part of the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. The petitioner worked off the farm until 1996 when he began to provide that service from the farm. In the circumstances, the family property should be divided equally. HELD: 1) There was a claim for $16,500 which was said to be owing to the respondent for the Versatile 160 tractor. He sold his trailer and the proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. He now claims an exemption in that amount. 2) There were several other debts and expenses which the respondent submitted should be taken into account. 3) An RRSP registered in the name of the respondent was found to be exempt. The interest earned would not be exempt, but have no evidence as to what that has been. 4) The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. Her furniture was included in the distribution. 5) The respondent's RRSP was not registered in her name. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, the petitioner should be paid $2,400 for the automobile and boat resulting in a total of $33,257.31. 6) In addition to the farm machinery, the respondent sold his tractor and the sale proceeds were used for the farm expenses. 7) There appears to be an RRSP registration in the respondent's name as well as a bank account. However the respondent shall have three months in which to pay the amount of the judgment and, in the event payment is not made, he may apply to this court for directions as to sale of the family home. 8) There is an exemption for the tractor in respect to the purchase of two 80-11 Seed Rites which were acquired from an uncle's estate and the 30' Morris rod weeder of value of $225. Both are statute-barred and the value of the tractor is unclear. 9) A debt of $1,200 which was referred to three appraisals; one which was done at the behest of the petitioner and two for the respondent. The father owns the tractor. 10) An exemption in respect of the 30's and 40' Morris Rod weeder are included. 11) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the Family property.

d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as a result of an interim order. The appellant’s application to impose a stay with respect to enforcement of the retroactive Spousal Support Arrears was allowed. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceedings is allowed. The court reviewed the evidence before the Chambers judge and concluded that the appellant was making significant payments with regard to the family home to cover the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities. The Chambers judge concluded that he was not supported by the evidence presented and the appellant may be prejudiced by the imposition of the stay. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the parties, including their incomes, expenses, financial obligations (payment of family debt) and the fact they share custody of their son.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure had been issued, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The mortgagee opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court gave to these courts the right, in foreclosure proceedings, to make an order for sale whenever the court deemed it necessary or expedient to do so. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement. The applicant is not entitled, in these proceedings, in a possession order. As long as Sandra remains in possession of the property, judicial sale through a realtor has little prospect of success.  1) Border Credit Union did not request immediate possession pursuant to Rule 439 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It did not seek immediate possession. 2) The applicant, who was not entitled in the proceedings to a possession possession order, was not co-operative with a court-appointed realtor.  3) The 90-day redemption period has now expired and subject to this application the applicant is entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. Any further delay that does not result in sale and payment of the mortgage in full, will result in lost security value for the Credit Union."

HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until trial, or until further order. The Court indicated that there would be a balance of convenience in the matter. 1)The applicant had shown more than the mere prospect or apprehension of injury. It had shown that the defendants in doing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights and that the applicant is suffering in consequence. 2)There was a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that was asserted."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the appeal was allowed. 1)It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. 2)The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. 3)The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. He found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' He found it integral to the operation, aside from transporting him to various places across the country. 4)A more significant issue was the refusal of the sentencing judge to order the forfeiture of this truck, which had value of approximately $20,000. The sentence judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeitures and erred in failing to do so. He failed to take into account the impact of an order of forfeiture on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling house was the member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence, and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the act. 5)The Court was of the view that the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, find there is no basis for interfering with the sentence."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) appealed its decision denying the worker's claim for recognition because his stress injury was not personal injury by accident but rather a result of workplace stressors. WCAT found that gradual onset stress requires that there have been work related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. At the heart of the appeal is whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether it applied it unreasonably. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) WCAT correctly decided that there had been, in fact, excessive stressors in the workplace. There were certain subjective elements which should be considered in determining if a worker's subjective reaction to external stressors is not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA; 2) The Policy sets out the better view of the law and should be taken as declaratory of the principles to be applied in this regard to all stress claims under GECA. 3) The Court reviewed the history of the tribunal and found that the policy was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia. The Court found that there were no 'unusual or excessive' stressors on the workplace which could be considered objectively as set out in the Policy. The policy set out the objective facts that each type of stressor is not a personal injury caused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The court found that this reflects the law which was in place before the Policy came into effect in July 2005. 4) The court reviewed the reasoning process by which WCAT reviewed these questions on appeal. It found that, in the context of the policy, the workplace events and stressors experienced by the worker were not 'extraordinarily and excessive' in the sense that they are compared to the work-related events, stressors, and other events experienced by a similar or similar worker in a similar occupation, WCAT applied it to the decisions relating to the claimant's claim in this case. It also found that WCAT did not err in determining whether there were workplace events (e.g., 'interpersonal conflict and ineffective management contributed to a toxic work environment') sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset onset stress.

The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","This was an action involving a contest between two insurance companies. In advancing their claim against one insured, Canada Trustco failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Under the terms of the arrangement between the Owners/Mortgagors and Marsh McLennan, coverage was put in place on the basis of notice from the mortgage company that the property had been destroyed in a fire.

The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence.

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood. HELD: The Court found that the accused had not rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1)(a). The Court also found that there was little, if any, danger of the accused changing his mind."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","This was an appeal from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father had paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of her time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and that her drinking and her care of the child was an ongoing problem. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order set aside.

The mother's affidavits were the only sworn evidence filed in support of her case. The reports prepared by the mother were not sworn or verified under oath. Even if the hearsay evidence were admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the daughter of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for her, there should have been an order directing trial of this issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence filed: Zaba v.

Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. He had alleged in that regard, a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b) and s. s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The accused was released from custody on a voir dire basis. The evidence was applied to the trial proper. The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the accused had not waived his right to counsel.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with 3 counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(b) and driving while disqualified. The Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all three counts. 1)The Crown has met the necessary burden of proof with respect to the issue of identity, entitling reliance upon the presumption provided for in s. 258.(1)(c) and may not rely on the Certificate of Analysis. There must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for the accused to be found guilty. 2)The accused's behaviour affected only the weight to be given to the evidence of the Crown witnesses over that of the accused."

HELD: The defendant was granted summary judgment. 1)The evidence advanced by County Realty was overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist. The mere statement by the defendant, that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issue exists which ought to be tried. 2)The defendant was entitled to summary judgment including a declaration with respect to the inventory and the existing order shall continue with damages to be determined."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant.

The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has bounced from home to home. HELD: 1) The court found that the father was not utilized as the caregiver of first resort. When the parties were unable to care for the children, they were left with their mother, or his sisters. The Court ordered that the principal residence be varied and awarded to the mother.  2) The father had abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters.

b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applied for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relied upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: The original order was correct at the time it was made. Arrears for that period will be adjusted to reflect the actual income earned by the respondent. 1) When dealing with a request to vary, the court must accept the original order is correct and that it is time to expunge the support order. 2) The respondent has failed in his onus here for the years 2005 through to 2012. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him, but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. If they want to rely on their declared income, they must establish why this time their representations should be accepted by the court. 3) The court must consider whether material change has occurred requiring review of the order. In approaching variation, the respondent needs to show material change in circumstances. The ability to vary an interim order has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, the payor does have the ability to pay the arrear from 2013 to date, due to the length of time that has elapsed. If he proceeds by way of motion to change, he must face the presumption that the original Order was correct and the original imputation of income was correct. 4) The Court must determine whether the existing order is still valid and whether it should be varied retroactively to impute a different income than that which was imputed in 2005. The respondent should not be rewarded in this regard for waiting out the payment obligations placed upon him. 5) It is not necessary for the court to determine whether an aggrieved party feels income was wrongly imputed. The actual situation does constitute material change. He is working full-time at this position and there is no suggestion he is under-employed in his new job. The Court will deal with the issue of material change as is necessary for final order of the Court."

Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention.

Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage.

The Crown argued that the disclosure of evidence by the Crown can affect the accused's election with respect to mode of trial or to the plea. To that end, through her counsel, she agreed to have the video taped statement go in without contest. The Court was satisfied that the new evidence could be used to impeach the accused and contradict things she had told to the Crown in her videotaped statement. The court was not satisfied that it could cure the prejudice of late disclosure to the accused by an order at this late stage."

The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.

It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not comply with the required time frame. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 26(2)(b) of The Farm Land security Act. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1)The defendant counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for rent owing from the plaintiffs as 'over holding tenants'. 2)To interpret the letter of commitment to beferred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgagefinancing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise their right to first refusal. 3)The terms of mortgage financing will always require certain things be performed before money is paid. The loan approval issued by the defendant is not an unconditional and unequivocal commitment to finance the purchase of the farm land. 4)The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation by offering a different requirement for the exercise of the right of refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. It did not require that it be forwarded to the Royal Bank of Canada. It simply required that the plaintiffs 'provide a such letter'."

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992. They have two children, Conor and Braden. The parties have been married for eight and half years and have two adult children, ages 7 and 9 years. The father seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother proposes sole custody, allowing him to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children. The Corollary Relief order shall reflect the parties' agreement for each parent to hold in trust and administer one-half the investments; specific access; and quantum of child maintenance. HELD: 1) The Court found that the present joint custody arrangement was not working on a day-to-day decision making basis. The Court ordered that both parents continue to share equal rights and responsibilities for major matters affecting the children, specifically in the areas of formal education, religion and major health issues, while ordering the mother to have sole responsibility and decision making authority for the day to day physical care and control and the father generous access.  2) There was no evidence of any pressing or immediate differences of philosophy or opinion between the parties in these major areas. Both parents were motivated by their interest in and concern for their children and not by a desire to interfere with the other parent's relationship with their children."

He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled.

The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The construction was completed four months late. There was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. The plaintiff adopted the suggestion and the construction was done. 2) The plaintiff was not liable to pay for the work but was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost and he did so. 3) Although the plaintiff ordered many changes, improvements and additions, it was clearly an extra ordered by him and he enjoyed savings by not paying interest. The contract contemplated that there would be extras but it did not speak to their cost. The amount to be charged to the plaintiff was to be the actual cost to the defendant. The delay postponed this and the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant one-half of that loss or $1,400. 4) Costs of Performance were to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The accused was convicted of driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that the trial judge had sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was impaired. She also failed to give a correct legal effect to the facts that she found, including, inter alia, the lack of evidence or indicia of impairment of the appellant at the time that he was found to have care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it."

HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs on double Col. 5. 1) The Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature. Only if the chambers judge abused his discretion by acting on some wrong principle, by disregarding some material matter of fact, or by failing to act judicially is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere.  2) It is not our function to fine tune orders such as this one. We are all of the opinion that this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed. We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Wident's Relief Act. HELD: The maintenance was to be paid monthly and the children were to have their personal effects preserved. 1)There was nothing within the will, read as a whole,with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term 'personal effects' to be given anything other than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.  2)The term personal effects does not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm.  3)The Court held that the term ""personal effects"" did not have a special place in the will. 4)The application was dismissed with the exception of any payment made to the child by the Executors as provided for in the Will.  5)It was held that a reasonable provision in s.9(1)of The Dependents Relief Act could no longer be defined as 'that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator'. The term 'Personal effects' did not include items of personal or domestic use or ornaments, clothing, furniture or furniture.  6)Personal effects did notinclude grain, cattle, farm equipment or machinery having some personal connection with the deceased.  7)The children were entitled to share equally with the father."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. At trial, counsel for the respondents advanced standard criminal law defences to the charges, and also a constitutional defence that the respondents as Metis had an aboriginal right to fish for food. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2, 6, 7 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he had found to be established. It is the acquittals based on the statutory defence that are the subject of this Crownappeal. HELD: 1)It is the Crown's position that it is open to the Crown to attempt to establish that your clients have an Aboriginal right to fishing for commercial purposes as a potential defence. 2)The Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at all. Rather, the appeal is limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4) and in any event the regulations are justified. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to conclude that therequirement to obtain a licence before engaging in fishing by means of a net setout in s.26(a) of the SFSRegulations does not constitute a 'prima facie infringement of any existing aboriginal right' of fish or to make out all the charges against your clients."

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The applicant sought an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against him in respect of charges brought against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The hearing was set aside by the Appeal Division and the disciplinary panel was reconvened to determine the validity of the charges against the applicant. The applicant applied to have the hearing adjourned until such time as he was medically able to attend. Dismissing the application, that the application for interim injunction is premature and irreversible. The application for certiorari is joined with an application for an order restraining the respondent from taking any further proceedings. HELD: The application is granted. 1)The court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very special circumstances.  2)The application for the interim injunction was granted without costs.  3)The applicant would have satisfied the requirements of the test."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and with trafficking of property obtained by crime. The accused had a knapsack with him in the vehicle console where the police later found it and a large amount of cash in the back pocket of the defendant's backpack. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain: an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale, a black wallet, a toothbrush and deodorant. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges before the Court. 1) The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the knapsacks was in the personal possession of the accused but that, because the cocaine was found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the accused was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large quantities of cash from any other source, the only logical inference here is that these rolls of cash were proceeds of drug trafficking. 2) The evidence was circumstantial in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the accused's possession. The evidence established that the accused had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. 3) There was no evidence to support the Crown's inference that the items seized by the police in this case were possessed for sale, not personal use. It was obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. The fact that they were found in an open motor vehicle in the open spot was also significant in the conclusion that the marijuana and cocaine were possessed by the defendant, not for sale. 4) There is no evidence that the defendant changed his hands when he entered the vehicle to change his hands. It is clear that he consented. The cash was not in his possession at the time of the investigation. 5) The Court was satisfied that the only reasonable conclusion was that these items were in his personal possession knowing they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The Court found that the evidence seized was admissible."

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","HELD: The Court found that the children were in need of protective services and that they were the offspring of three (3) or four (4) fathers. All three children, except S.M., had some form of special needs or developmental delay. All of the children had been in temporary care of their maternal grandparents. The Court ordered that the Agency provide transport and money to secure the child's diaper rash lotion and product.

The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his youth sentence when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. The Youth Court judge held that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the youth court judge erred in her interpretation of s. 107(1)(b). For the reasons which follow, that this proviso cannot have been intended to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under a separate section. These sections may allow the issuance of a warrant authorizing apprehension, which is found in s. 102(2), and may direct the provincial director to review the case promptly, as that is the focus of s102. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. The court reviewed the case and, within forty-eight hours, cancelled the suspension of the conditional supervision or refer the case to the youth justice court for review. 2) The Court reviewed the Youth Court decision and found, with any modifications that the circumstances require, that the Minister of Justice's ability to “suspend” community supervision is subject to appeal."

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a declaration. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on the proposal he made because it is not his to waive. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. The communication need not contain any settlement offer any communication designed or intended to explore settlement, or from which the Court might infer there are settlement communications contemplated or in the works, is protected. The privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should err on the side of protecting the privilege."

The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties share joint custody of the three children. Day-to-day primary care shall be with the mother. The parties agree that a Joint Custody Order shall issue and that primary care will remain with the father. The children's best interests are served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their mother. HELD: 1) The parties have been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and that the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. 2) It is apparent to me that the children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. Some will be appropriate Section expenses and some will not. In the event that the mother is seeking contribution from the father, she must give notice of the activity and the cost. 3) Spousal support is requested by the wife. She does not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. 4) There is no basis for an unequal division as listed in s. 18 of the Matrimonial Property Act."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)There had been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. 2)There was no explanation for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather. 3)The accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, delayed until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial, and otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial. 4)The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007, period of two months."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion. The defendant says that there is no evidence that his cows were in it on any other occasion, and that such loss as was caused by his cattle is minimal. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs, together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by the straying cattle."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt sought an order of disbursement of $1,750.00 from the Revenue Canada for a failed agreement and lease of his former business Red Bull Enterprises Ltd. He contended that the failure was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways. The bankrupt contended that s.173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited disclosure of this information. HELD: 1)There was no evidence that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of the bankrupt's former business. 2)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. 3)The Court was not convinced that these proceedings were final in nature and dismissed the objection.  4)Section 173(1)of the Act requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge.  5)Section 241 of the Act prohibits disclosure of income tax remittances.  6)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 of the Affidavit of James Douglas Cook is confidential and disclosure is improper."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He had been out all night at social event and had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy, including building a new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before Mr. Boake's death but had been informed by the tragedy. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit and placed himself at risk. His failure was in not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a total penalty of $25,000. 1)It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the defendant's farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill indicate clearly that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before August 13 2006 and has endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since his death. The farm was inherently dangerous and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk. This was a case where safety was a daily risk and the defendant took steps to improve safety. 2)The defendant's failure was not in failing to secure the barricade which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order. Punishment should be mitigated by his lesser degree of culpability. He also has no prior record for Occupational health and Safety act violations."
2_2012nssc359.txt,"Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77 This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children. The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. HELD: Costs were assessed against the respondent. Costs were payable at rate of $150 per month until paid in full, 2012 NSSC 267 (CanLII). 1) Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. Income was expended to the applicant. The Court imputed an income level to her that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). 2) Costs of $3,000 are assessed for the respondent on the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the Applicant was the appropriate primary care parent. 3) The respondent's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. It is my conclusion that Mr. Williams's submissions needlessly resulted in the expenditure of time and effort by all involved and delayed the issuance of an order. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18."

The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the defendant to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the plaintiff during the purposed class. The defendant brought two separate notices of motion requesting that the plaintiff be examined on her affidavit. HELD: The application for examination was dismissed. 1)It is important to note that we are in the pre certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. The action is defined under s. 14 of the Class Action Act as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998'. The purpose of the motion is to give the defendant the opportunity to provide notice to potential class members. 2)The wording of the Moore affidavit creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations. It is not necessary to follow the usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation. The practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court apply. The practice and implementation of the Rule 82(6) and s. 24 of our Act in my view precludes this type of examination. 3)The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. The Court will not be able to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.'s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.

The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.

The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the Ottenbreit order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. 2) The order of Sandomirsky J. is set aside and the respondent is ordered to pay $600 per month. 3) The respondent's application for costs is dismissed."

HELD: Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation, the cost is the responsibility of the Province. The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the cost for supplying the building free of costs. It would not include those expenses associated with operating the building.

The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs.

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)There was no contract that the judge could enforce. The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case.  2)The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that settlement should not be enforced by the court if it is 'obviously incomplete'. 3)The Court reviewed the reasoning of the Unified Family Court in Zimmerman v. Zimmerman (1992), 104 Sask. R. 150, at p. 153. 4) and found that the Court was not dealing with complete agreements settling or purporting to settle all aspects of the actions."
6_2002nssc288.txt,"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The applicant applied for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial in the province of Quebec. The sole issue was whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia regarding the motor vehicle accident which occurred in the Province of Quebec because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens. HELD: The application was granted with costs. 1)The plaintiff had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice. This right is subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non- conveniens and that a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. 2)The substantive law of the place where the injury occurred was the law of Nova Scotia. The court reviewed the briefs and found that Nova Scotia was a forum. 3)The court considered the factors set out in O’Brien vs. Canada and Oakley vs. Barrie, and considered the factual submissions that have been made on behalf of the respondent in this application and that is the conclusion that have reached. 4)It was an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial here. The applicant appeared to have argued a determination of question of law but the respondent has not really made any submissions of substance concerning forum non. The applicants have not provided a lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; police whether report was filed; whether anybody investigated the accident; whether any of them were seen by doctors and, if so, where they are located and whether they might be called to testify at trial. The substantive law that governs the conduct of the trial will be the law here. 5)If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law, before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of a place of trial. 6)The applicant was unsuccessful with respect to questions arising from forum conveniens, and the Court was left to decide what to do about costs."

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3). The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: The Court was of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her objectives."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since his 'driver's license' was revoked. HELD: The accused was not guilty of driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his 'license was revoked' was dismissed. The only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving on the road while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2). The offence was committed when the accused's ATV was operating on public highways and he was not lawfully licensed to drive it.  1)It seems apparent, therefore, that one must consider the context in which the words “motor Vehicle” are used within the sections of the motor vehicle act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV’s or other prohibited vehicles. 2)The word ‘motor’ is used within s.2(m) to determine if the provision applied to the uses of ATVs. The word “vehicle” is used in the same context as'vehicle' and the phrase “jotor vehicle registered or required to be registered under this Act.” It is argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the ATV, the revocation of his driver’S license and the charge before the court is not the charge for the court. 3)The accused could not have obtained a license to drive an ATv on the highways because it was a prohibited motor vehicle. He was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license. 4)The words 'driver’ means license issued under this act to drive motor vehicle upon the highway.  5) The accused could have been charged with an offence of operating an off-highway vehicle while his license was cancelled, revoked or suspended. 6)It was vehicle that could not be subject to the same obligations."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of dangerous driving and assault. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had intentionally driven in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner that the complainant did not consent to the application of force. The Court reviewed the trial judge's decision in Wiebe, 2011 SKQB 389 (CanLII), 368 Sask. R. 541. The standard of review is not whether the conclusion was correct, or even if an appellate court would have interpreted the evidence differently. This is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the verdict."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. The Lawless have an English speaking background. They attended an English language school for two years. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend a French language school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The family applied for an interlocutory injunction, alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved. The court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue attending the school and that the court would facilitate their transfer to another school."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","The applicant land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts the applicant submitted its last plan for final approval on March 14, 2000. The next day, the application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the Applicant. The Applicant took the position that because it received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, its application should be grand-parented and it should only have to meet road standards as they existed at the time it received the tentative approval. Technically in the case at bar it was not refused it was simply declared incomplete. This was significant in light of s. 250(3) which gives the development officer his jurisdiction. The application was incomplete and the applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation entered into a letter agreement with the defendant to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, but agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought to set aside the default judgment on the basis that the letter agreement did not constitute an enforceable contract; third, if it did, that the plaintiff was not liable under the contract to the defendant and fourth, that it was not going to file a defence in Ontario. The defendant applied pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 (Rule 12.07) to set up a default judgment in Nova Scotia. The matter was originally set down for Regular Chambers to be heard on March 9, 1995. In that case, the plaintiff sought a leave to take default under Civil Procedure rule 12.03 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not materially affect the defendant."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was to be mutually agreed upon between the respondent and the child who was now 18 years of age. The petitioner was to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9 and P-10 and was to contribute one-third of the costs of any future extra-ricular activities which the parties mutually agreed to. HELD: 1)The petitioner spent $400 per week of day care for Breeanna which equals $400. The total costs of $440 were to be paid by the petitioner and the respondent in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. 2)The respondent is to pay 1/2 of the $948 per month for the petitioner's two children, namely, Kaitlyn, born November 1992, and Breeanna, born May 1996. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 3)The court found that the respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of Breeanna. It is agreed that the petitioner receives the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of Randy. The court ordered $300.00 as payment for the two natural children of the marriage and $40.00 per month is to be taken and added to the Guideline amount to obtain the total payable for the three children. 4)The Court found that there was no evidence as to the tax implications regarding matrimonial property although the respondent attempted to introduce such evidence through an expert. The respondent failed to give notice of the expert in contravention of the Rules of Court."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars, and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. HELD: In the circumstances, the Government was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings support a claim for damages for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust."
