He used his position of authority as police chief to commit the crimes. The offender did not have a criminal record. The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority. This message is particularly important to police officers, whose integrity must be beyond reproach.","The defendant plead guilty to five theft related charges. He was 43 years old and a former Chief of Police for the Town of Kentville. He had been a police officer for four years. He has a grade 12 education. He is married and has two children. The total amount of money involved for all five counts exceeds $64,000. He will receive a restitution order under s. 738 of the Criminal Code.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent says the limitation time has not expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, 1988-89, c. S-17.1 provides for a suspension of limitation time running while certain proceedings are underway pursuant to that Farm Security act. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The Court found that the application to discharge s. 22 of the Farm SecurityAct as set out in s. 11(1) of the Limitations Act did not have an expiration date. 2) The application to continue the limitation by way of s. 12(16) was deemed to have expired. 3) The applicant was entitled to the costs of her application against the respondent."
3_1997canlii15044.txt,"The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident. Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.","The applicant sought approval of the court for a settlement of a crush injury to the right leg below the knee. The medical reports on file indicated that the infant suffered a crush injuries to the knee, knee, and ankle respectively. No surgery was required and the infant was advised to return to his pre-accident activities. The Contingency Fee Agreement between the applicant and the child's family physician provided for 30% payment of the sum settled upon plus disbursements. The taxman did not check to see if the Contingencies Fee Agreement met the requirements of the Civil Procedure Rule governing it. As this was not done, the Court was not prepared to allow any fee payable to the taxman."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) Given that the presumption of care and controlling was rebutted, the trial judge considered whether the accused had rebutled the presumption, just barely, that the appellant had been in actual care or control. The trial judge found that, in the circumstances of the case, that was the only defence he had. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings. 2) Given the accused's evidence that he rebutts the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as to rebut the presumption that it is retrospective, and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. The accused rebutting the presumption by adding the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving, to the test which would be required of an accused attempting to establish 'evidence to the contrary' so as rebut to the statutory presumption of accuracy, was found to be ineffective. 3) The trial court found that the trial court erred in finding that the accused rebuffed the presumption (as opposed to the presumption) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and Control of the vehicle. The evidence showed that the officer had calibrated the instrument and the blood alcohol concentration of the accused to rebus the presumption so that it was retrospective. The error was fatal to the appellant's defence."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.",The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm in the operation of a motor vehicle. She appealed her conviction and raised numerous grounds of appeal. The appellant had been in the wrong lane of the highway for approximately 3.5 hours prior to the accident and had been advised by her husband that there was a possibility of a mechanical defect in either vehicle which could have caused the accident. The trial judge made inconsistent findings concerning the impact of the Charter breach on her appeal.
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the Act and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application. The appeal court found: that the respondents had not followed the proper process and that they had not imposed their own preordained outcome. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application; the Court of Queen's Bench found that this was an overly restrictive view of the relevant provisions of the act. The controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. The decision of the Elections Board is set aside pursuant to the Act. The Chambers judge did not err in finding that the majority of students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The issue is whether the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the broad rules of natural justice. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The court was entirely satisfied that the applicant was a proper person to bring this application. It is important not to confuse the statutory concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard with the concepts of common law that typically form the basis of judicial review applications such as the one considered in Walton v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association. 2) The Court found that it was not necessary to work through the merits of the arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, the Court was entirely convinced that the application was premature. The applicant had standing to apply and the relief awarded by the Chambers court was appropriate.  3) The applicant was not entitled to a share in the relief offered."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 charge and, in his opinion, a conviction only for impaired driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. In this case, the trial judge made no errors in law. The decision to enter a judicial stay on the.07 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. The case law requires that an accused be the complete focus of Constable Coe's attention when he is stopped. The Court was not satisfied that the readings were the same as those on the impaired charge. The accused's breathalyzer readings showed him more than twice the legal limit but the reading showed he was more than half the legal maximum. The officer observed the accused was crossing the parking lot to his car and had fallen on ice. When he is arrested, he is still stumbling and dropping keys. The complainant's blood alcohol content at the time of driving is.08. The breath demand was subsequently dropped. The defence of the impaired driver on the  impaired driving count was not raised. HOLD: The Court held that the error was fatal to the conviction. The trial court ordered that the certificate readings should be set aside and either an acquittal or a new trial ordered.  1)The Court was unable to resolve the issue of the certificate reading. 2)The accused's evidence was not useful in determining the trial decision. The evidence was sufficient to resolve a direct trial error. The error was rendered in the circumstances. The conviction was set aside with a new order of trial. 3)The trial judge was unable, in a direct way, to resolve this matter. The Crown did not commit an error in law by setting aside the certificate evidence."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision reversed. The court found that the respondent failed to meet the requirements of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act and was therefore not entitled to claim an exemption under s. 7(1). The broad interpretation of the board that it applied in determining the assessment was not the best way to determine whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan but rather an independent purchase was not necessary. The board's finding that the Appellant failed to comply with s.8(1) of The Act and is therefore not qualified to claim exemption. The broad definition eliminates the anomaly.
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown had previously appealed the conviction of assaulting the complainant with a weapon contrary to s267(1)(a) of the Code. In issue was whether the complainant had been afraid and had not been able to tactically reposition. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The trial judge tested the complainant's evidence against that of the officer and found that the complainant reasonably believed that he was being assaulted. The issue was proportionality. The court found that even if the complainant’s mistake of fact had been reasonable, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. The following facts are taken from the trial judgment or are uncontroverted: 1) The complainant indicated that he had been preparing for an altercation and that he, too, was afraid there was going to be a fight. The officer did not pull out his baton to deal with a dangerous or threatening situation. The complainant remained on the ground for several seconds after the officer told him to remain on the floor. The confrontation lasted only a few seconds and the officer was yelling at the complainant and he did not move. The accused was not injured physically. The Court awarded leave to appeals and allowed the appeal. 2) The trial court found no inconsistency in the complainant. The failure on the part of the trial judge to refer explicitly to certain evidence does not constitute an error. The decision of the Court of Appeal was not made lightly. The evidence of the complainant was not taken into account in assessing whether the officer reasonably believed he was assaulted."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.",The appellant appealed his decision to join the CUPE Tribunal and find that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the appellant's last employment position. The appellant had Cerebral Palsy and his job was to hauling materials with an eight-ton tandem truck. The decision was based on a claim by the appellant that the city had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The tribunal found that the appellant had made his complaint within the Code's limitation period and that it had acted reasonably in finding that the applicant had not been properly accommodated by the City in the past. The City had accordingly refused to accommodate the appellant. The appeal was dismissed.

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and use or threatened use of weapon.

The Crown submitted that the officer had advised the accused that he should not avail himself of immediate counsel and made an informed decision to seek counsel of a person who had been his friend for the past 12 hours. The officer told the accused he would call a legal counsel after the arrest, but the accused said he did not understand the Charter and said he had not asked for this advice. The defence submitted that this was a fundamental misunderstanding by the accused of his basic rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached voluntarily. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction.

The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The petitioner and her estranged husband had a consent judgment in June 2002 which provided that the respondent would have custody of their two children, aged 16 and 10 years. The consent judgment provided that it would be in the child's best interests to be moved from Eastend to live with his father and common law wife in Edmonton. The petitioner sought an order prohibiting the respondent from removing the child from Saskatchewan until she obtains a Court order allowing her to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above requires the petitioner to obtain an order. It only provides that the father receive 90 days' written notice. The respondent was informed verbally of the proposed move in September or early October."

The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984.

The 40% share, having vested in her, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, Russell. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal.  2)The terms of the clause restricting the amount of monthly payments which can be made to the applicant were interpreted as meaning they were monthly payments. 3)The clause restricting monthly payments beyond 30 days was merely an interpretation of clause 14(b) of the Regina Act. The vesting order of December 19, 1985 did not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly the 40% portion, having been vested in, is now a share that she may dealt with without the reference or the consentof, or the mother of, the respondent."

Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care. Unfortunately, the agency lost confidence in the appellant and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The appellant's husband reported the problem to the Agency, which it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The application was subsequently rescissioned on the authority of the Family Court on the basis of Civil Procedure Rule 15.07 and 15.08. The Family Court Judge in rejecting the application dismissed the appeal.

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired.

The accused was found not guilty on both counts. The Court held that it was fundamental that the party introducing opinion evidence based upon hypothetical facts has the burden of establishing those facts in evidence. Impairment is an issue of fact which the trial judge must decide on the evidence. The evidence of the accused' testimony was found to be frail as to leave the trial jury with reasonable doubt.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the defendant, the defendant. The matter had been adjourned to allow the plaintiff to enter into a statement of claim. The defendant entered into a verbal agreement that the vehicles would be paid in installments and the plaintiff would make payments. The plaintiff's claim was also dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. 1)There was no defence entered to the claim by Redhead against Standard and the defendant was noted for default. The Court reviewed the documents and found that although there had been no specific contract with respect to the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant made some payments on behalf of the plaintiff in order to keep the vehicle operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor Hyndman benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money. The facts did not satisfy the Court on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the defendant based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)The actions taken by both Redhead and Hyndmans were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. The defendants took steps to keep that operational. Neither Redhead or Hyndwoman benefited from the arrangement for long and neither lost money nor lost money either. The action against the defendant in relation to the unpaid repairs was dismissed with costs.  3)Although there was no specific contractual arrangement between the parties, it is clear that HyndMan did make some payments for the plaintiff, Redhead, with respectto some work orders that were issued by the plaintiff. As a result, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant benefited from it for very, long and either lost money or lost money, the plaintiff”s claim on this ground was dismissed as not being appropriate."

The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] The majority of the claim by the respondent in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges it is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother claims it is for personal purposes and is responsible for the capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership. The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income is three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father's personal farming statement. The income of the petitioner is $24,300. The father will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those arrear to be paid monthly. See no reason why the overpayment by the father should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances. HELD: The Court held that the holding of trial was the most efficient and cheaper method of coming to the conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. The case law focused on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown they are unnecessary or unreasonable. The Court was not prepared to add back to income in any of the three years leading up to the issue being determined."

An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. The applicants have been serving their 'life' or 'indeterminate' sentences at the Penitentiary and Sinobert has remained assessed as minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security Riverbender Institution. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Services of Canada declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. Thus, habeus corpus cannot review the way the Correctional service manages an inmate's sentence as is the case here.

For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division.

This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove this aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)An application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. 2)The Court's jurisdiction was reviewed. 3)The trial of the issue of liability should only been granted for compelling reasons.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The respondent had two children, aged 12 and 7. The applicant had her own business. The parties agreed that joint custody of the children would be shared by the parties, with the primary responsibility for the children being the mother. The respondent asked the court to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment, arguing that the former wife was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income rather than obtain employment. The former wife opposed the application, claiming that spousal support and child support should be varied, and asked the Court to review the child tax return, the amount of spousals and the sum of her RRSP income. The court awarded the amount to the applicant in the amount $1,000.00. The amount of child support payable was to be adjusted by the $500.00 gross up of his dividends and $481.04 for professional fees.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail.

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge found that the mother had made no palpable and overriding error in her finding that the daughters were not in arreaventricular activities or children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act; that there was no agreement in 1997 to pay specified or other maintenance; that the parties had not communicated to the other about their future plans and needs; that in light of the case law, the evidence did not show that she unilaterally withdrew from the relationship."

The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, was in an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide 'call out' services on 'call outs' on'special occasions'. The defendant initially refused to pay its invoices as they became due, and in November 2015 ceased to pay them as they were due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought. The defendant was successful in reducing the amount of money that it was seeking but not entirely. The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price. 1)Reliable was awarded the sum of $1,550.85.  2)Reliability was awarded costs of the action.

c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during the construction of a sewage treatment lagoon. The defendant had hired a consulting contractor to do the work and had undertaken a complete renovation of the lagoon which was completed in 1994. After the completion of the project, a mud slide occurred causing extensive damage to the plaintiff's property and her property. She applied to set aside the default judgment on the basis that it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court. Application granted; the defendant had 10 days to file its defence; if the default was set aside, the defendant would have 10 days in which to file the defence. Although the plaintiff failed to file notice of intention to proceed, she did receive notice from the prothonoteary that it would be available within 10 days. The prothonian had no authority to grant the default. The failure to file a notice of intent to proceed was a fairly arguable defence and there was no basis for excluding it. The court reviewed whether there was a substantial amount of laxness on the part of the defendant administration. The Court found that the pro-thonoticary had no jurisdiction to issue the default order and that it should exercise its discretion to set it aside."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The trustee opposed his discharge application and sought payment of the outstanding balance of his outstanding mortgage. The bankrupt's lawyer objected to the discharge on multiple grounds, including his intentional failure to provide proper and complete information to the trustee. The bankruptcy judge found that the bankrupt had not shown sufficient remorse for his actions and the bankrupt was entitled to a payment in full of costs and a conditional order of discharge equal to half of their total judgment. The creditor also questioned the bankrupt's intentional failure not to provide adequate documentation to the court and to cooperate with the court. The court found that this was a very difficult case because of the conflicting interests at play. The creditors' interest in obtaining a fair recovery on their sizeable debts, the bankrupts need to be rehabilitated and safeguarding the integrity of the bankruptcy system itself. The plaintiff was a self- represented litigant in the SCU action and advanced his defence and counter-claim as best he could with limited grade education. The judge found the bankrupt to be completely unreasonable and took the unusual step of saying so. The Court awarded costs to the plaintiff and awarded him a conditional award of $8,000 in addition to surplus income. The debtor's position on this ground was that he had no assets and that he should be able to comply with the conditional order within three years, which was considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to not be burdened with a conditional Order."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the chambers judge had not erred in his decision to require the appellant to pay proportionately to the extracurricular activities of the children, despite the fact that the children were registered in and participated in at the time of the application. The order was also found to have been made in error, because the respondent had not included the expenses in the Guidelines as extraordinary expenses. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and did not meet the standard of child support set out in the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent argued that the judge erred when he determined that the extricular activities were ordinary, but the appellant was ordered to pay 73% of the net day care costs and six specific extracricular activities, which were not extraordinary. The appeal court also dismissed the respondent's application for an order retroactive to May 2006."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The Board's decision to favour the union over the employer was patently unreasonable. 2)The test of'substantial compliance' is the same as that which would have been expected in a reasonable situation. The parties agreed to an agreement which eventually brought wage increases to the level required by the Act. Once the agreement was signed, the bargaining process was a deadlock and the bargaining power of the parties was lost. Once a party to a collective agreement is passed, the agreement is presumed to have succeeded. Once it has failed, the party will no longer be prepared to compromise. Once agreement is achieved, the parties will cease bargaining and the benefits will be retroactive to the date they agreed to the agreement. Once that agreement is signed, however, the benefits which would normally have been available to the Board are no longer available. 3)The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April 2000 which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible. The motion failed. 4)The Court found that the errors made here were so severe as to meet the standard of patently unreasonably unreasonable as defined by the Courts. The Court found the motion guilty."

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'.

It was not inconsistent with the usual sentence. The appeal court judge erroded the provisions of the Health and Animals Act by setting the total fine at $72,000, thus exceeding the overall capacity of the offence. The fines are disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the sentence is 'demonstrably unfit.' Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. Oppositing the appeal, that the Court of appeal judge errically erred by setting a maximum fine of a factor of 15, which is disproportionately high for an offender.

b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.

He would have worked, on average, 90 of the 180 days and the average work week was 34.25 hours.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The question for the Court was whether the respondent was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the respondent have been resolved. The respondent has a child, born April 3, 2004. The issue for the court is whether the petitioner is a 'child of themarriage' as defined in the Act (the parties married May 1, 2007 and separated less than one year later, on March 12, 2008). The parenting, support issues and the respondent's unusual relationship with his biological child have been addressed. The petitioner's relationship with the respondent family has been resolved; the respondent has re-established contact with the Tristen. The child's relationship to the respondent and the child has been relatively lengthy from the point of view of the respondent. The propensity to find parental status should be directly proportional to the length of the married marriage and inversely proportional to that of the natural parent. Intentions inferred from actions are at the root of the parental status finding."

The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence.

The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the parties provide the receipts for these expenses as they are incurred and the father pay his 59% share of the expenses within 10 days of receiving them. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the s. 7 expenses should be made retroactive; 2) whether child support should be retroactive given the mother's limited income; and 3) costs. HELD: 1). The child care expenses incurred do not meet the requirements set out in s.7(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The costs are in the discretion of the Court and are not to be ordered. 2) retroactive child support awarded retroactive to August 2000. The mother's contribution to [N.G.K.B.]'s s. 8(f) expenses should not be allowed.

HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The applicant registered the property under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and under the Trustee in Bankruptcies Act. The vesting order applied for would register title in favour of the proposed purchaser. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity were adversely affected. HELD: Based upon the submissions of counsel, the court satisfied that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, 1978, c. L-5.1 is nevertheless reintroduced by the Land Tiling Facilitation Regulations, R.R.S., c.L-5 and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders. The application for the vesting ordered is granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, aged 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The primary issue between the parties was custody of the children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, child support was payable by either party. The mother initially resisted the father's proposal to move from Alberta to Saskatchewan, believing that the move would result in negative social and academic consequences. The father later moved to Alberta, taking with him the children who resided with the mother. The parties lived in a common law relationship and were living in duplex that the mother had recently purchased. The children had access to their father's home every second weekend, overnight access during the week, alternate school vacations and one month each summer. HELD: The children were in joint custody of both parents. The Court held that the child support payable in a'split custody' situation was the difference between the amount that each parent would otherwise pay if a child support order were sought against each of the parties and was not as limiting as it might seem. The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for the children now was stability. That stability was found in their father’s home. The parents had been living together for four years. The wife had recently commenced a new relationship and had undertaken some form of counselling. The husband had recently moved from Alberta and was considering a move to Saskatchewan. HOLD: The Children were in the joint custody custody of [C.O.] and [K.O.' and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The court found that the children were doing well in their new home and that it was in their best interests to move away from an environment that offered them the stability that they require and from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon. The child was to have equal access to the father."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee, who was engulfed in grain in a receiving pit, when the incident occurred. The employee died at the scene. Viterra is charged with the same offences under the Canada Labour Code. The same employee who died in the receiving pit was also charged under the same provisions of the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations. The Court of Appeal declined to accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to prevent the health or safety of an employee. HELD: ViterRA is charged under s. 124 of the Code with failing, failing or failing to make the required safety procedures aware. 1) The Court found that the employee did not adequately supervise or take appropriate steps to ensure his health and well-being. The officer testified that he was not instructed to do so. The facts were so numerous that it was impossible to tell for sure whether he had adequately instructed the employee on how to unplug the pit or not. 2) The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures rather than burying them. The fact that the witness suffered serious injury is evidence that the appellant did not ensure his safety. Not everything that he related can be accurate and have no way of knowing which parts are accurate and which parts aren't. Consequently, cannot and do not rely on the evidence of the witness."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment on evidence, alleging that the motor vehicle accident which occurred in 1998 was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being driven by the other plaintiff, Johansson. Both Johansson and Jody were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The defendant now claims damages for injuries they suffered as a result of the accident which they allege was caused, by the careless and negligent actions of the defendant in the manufacture of of the car involved. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development in the community of Nipawin and from giving third reading to and adopting a Bylaw 756/99; from further considering an application for discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre; from giving a third reading and adopting the Bylaws; from holding any further public meetings; from considering an applicant's application for a discretionary use use permit; from any further considering a private hotel proposal. HELD: The application was granted in part.  1)The applicants spoke of the public interest, it appears to be intimately entwined with their personal self-interest. It may well be that a new hotel will have somewhat adverse economic effect on the existing hotels and motels. However, it does not necessarily follow that a hotel will be a detriment to the community as a whole. It could well be in the best interest of the community to be in its best interest. 2)The applicant did not demonstrate bad faith. The fact that the proposal was presented in camera was recorded and the Council's consequent action was made part of the record. 3)There was no evidence of bad faith between the applicants and the respondent. The proposal was well-received in the Town and was well received. 4)The only complaint that the applicants suffered was that the respondents had acted unreasonably and arbitrarily. The court found nothing to be out of place or out of the ordinary. The applicant did demonstrate bad character and candor. The Court found nothing out of ordinary or out-of-place about the applicants' motives or lack of candor or candor in making their submission. The only thing that could have been out of order was the fact that they had not been advised of the proposal by the Town Council."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.",The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act. The chambers judge struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant had not broken its commitments under s.' 36 of The Charter; the claim should not be struck summarily; and the appeal court found the appellant’s proposed interpretation of s.36 had no chance of success. The court reviewed the applicable legal principles surrounding applications to strike and the heavy burden faced by the appellant as an applicant for an order to strike.
6_2001nssc105.txt,"The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land. The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract. Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff broker for the defendant real estate brokerage, commenced negotiations with the intention of selling the land to the public. The transaction was negotiated privately between the parties and involved an award of 5% commission on the basis of which the plaintiff would receive 10% commission. The defendant, who lived in the area for several years, acquired many parcels of land in an area known as Hell Point. The transactions were concluded privately. The plaintiff then took the opportunity to develop a retirement farm. The issue of the 5% commissions came up in the discussions with the plaintiff's wife and her husband. The court ordered the plaintiff to provide written confirmation of his intentions within 7 days. The lawyer for the plaintiff had advised him that he did not intend to be bound by the terms of the agreement. The client had been very impressed with the proposal and expressed his concern that the commission structure would be negotiable. The broker agreed to pay 5% but only 5% if the project met the Planning Board's planning approval. The Court ordered costs reserved until a later date."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines were accurate and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949 and interim spousal support in that amount. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent had unilaterally transferred their son, ostensibly because he was not receiving sufficient attention at Argyle. The respondent subsequently applied for interim child and spousals support and an equal division of family property. The court found the respondent’ s Federal Child Tax Credit to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed interim spouse and child support of $5,250.00. The Court also found the appellant’S Federal Child Services Guidelines to be in excess in excesses of $250,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded interim child care and spouse support in addition to child support and child and child maintenance.  2) The Court reviewed the financial statements and personal tax returns and found the child to be doing well in the chosen field. The children’re educational needs were met primarily through the care of their son. D.K. was an intelligent and pleasant boy, who was generally well-behaved. He was active in the community and enjoyed spending time with his friends. He and the respondent, who had recently moved to Canada, had a son, who resided with them for the past four years. DK.’d been attending Grade 5 at the time of the birth and was doing well academically. He also had a grade 7 education. He worked part-time and was able to assist with the child’ss education and health care needs. The child was attending classes at the school and was involved in the day-to-day activities of the child. The parties had purchased a condominium in Regina and, after some unsuccessful attempts to obtain a home, moved to Saskatoon. The residence was rented by the respondent and the child was generally in the residence with the petitioner. The mother lived with the respondent for the first three months of the school year. The family relocated to Sasktel in 2012 and moved to Ottawa. The following year, the petitioner was given access only three weekends a month and each Wednesday.

The Court declines to grant the order. The application is brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173. The Rule 173 applies. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff will have his costs fixed at $400 in any event of the cause. The statement of claim is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and is otherwise an abuse of process. The facts as pleaded would not constitute defamation in law even if proven to be true. There is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty. The statements made by the Defendant are scandalous and frivolous and are otherwise anabuse of process HELD 1) There may be merit to the defendant's claim but it cannot be dealt with in this application. While several affidavits were filed, none of them speak to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were committed. There was no assertion that the comments were made to board members. There were no references to the persons with the corresponding duty within the statement of claims. The Statement of Claim does not allege that any of the statements were published by the Defendants. It speaks of the remarks being made to the Board members. However, that phrase may only be descriptive of the persons. In any event, it does not establish the persons were carrying out some board function at the relevant time. 2) The statement is scandalously frivolous and frivolous. It cannot be decided for an instant that the complaints related to the termination of the employment contract were the same as the complaints about the dismissal of the teacher. The Law of Defamation In Canada by Raymond E. Brown states that a reasonable cause of action is to establish a cause ofaction. The test is whether the plaintiff proves everything alleged in the claim, there is nevertheless no reasonable chance of success, and the quoted test has not been met. 3) There is nothing to substantiate a claim for defamation. There must be some mutuality of interest or duty between the publisher and recipient. It must be shown that the publisher had some duty or interest in making the communication, and those to whom it was made had some interest in receiving it, or at least he or she was acting on behalf of someone who had such an interest. The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant.

The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the Credit union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the CreditU became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonseto and was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed. It is common ground that the defendant, Gari, and the CreditUnion were never landlord and tenant. At best, the CreditUI reserved security interest in goods which were affixed to the Property. The Court of Queen's Bench observed that Gari paid a total of $6,227.88 in property taxes during the time it says the Building remained on the Property after it should have been removed. That payment was made to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town. The Cross-appeal was also successful. The defendant's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the notion that the credit Union was its tenant. The court agreed with the defendant that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to remove a Building unless the Creditunion paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. The plaintiff's claim must fail."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the learned trial judge erred in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) While the trial judge reviewed the relevant factors and found nothing which constituted objective grounds for setting aside the acquittals on the impaired driving charge, the Crown did not question the credibility of the officers. 2) The trial judge failed to take into account the respondent's honest belief that he was impaired and the objective grounds to move from suspicion to objective belief. The Court must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the demand. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he is impaired and how they can be used to form grounds of suspicion only, such as the smell of alcohol on the breath, stumbling and slurred speech and the ability to orient himself would be grounds of reasonable suspicion only. 3) The observations by the officer upon whom the officer separated the vehicle from the other vehicle and found that the respondent made a U-turn, which was in violation both of s8 and s.7 of the Criminal Code. The officer was of the opinion that the appellant was showing signs of impairment and she concluded that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The appellant was cooperative and did not object to the stop. 4) The appellant's actions were found to be inadmissible in forming the objective basis for the objective test which was to determine the respondent’s objective grounds of seizure. The breath samples were found at the scene of the stop and at the intersection and at his vehicle registration. 5) The Court was of firm belief that the accused’ s.8 Charter rights were violated. The respondent was found to have had a normal day, but had been in a state of confusion and had not been able to locate his documentation. The accused was found not to have been impaired by any means. 6) The evidence gathered by the police at the trial was conclusive in that the breath samples did not show impairment. The evidence was that the officer was attempting to find the appellant’S driver’d vehicle. The fact that the affidavit material was found in the presence of the appellant and the breathalyzer technician was also sufficient grounds to exclude the breath sample. The determination of impairment was also objective."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial to allow time for a review of recently disclosed documents. The defence counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. In the weeks immediately following the trial, Crown counsel disclosed to the court that they were compiled by the Crown, with the sole purpose of disclosing the documents to defence counsel. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further time. The documents remain undisclosed. The Court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that we are not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. new trial ordered."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident that occurred when the defendant's police vehicle turned left in front of her vehicle. She claimed that the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that she was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 am on a Sunday morning without turning on the headlights. The defendant testified that he had been advised by his superior that the lights were not on in the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the motor vehicle collision and that he was not aware the intersection was a dark section. The plaintiff claimed that she had been focused on the police officer when she left the scene and that when she came to the police vehicle she saw the lights of the defendant vehicle turn right in frontof her vehicle, which she believed was the police car. The plaintiffs claimed the defendant was contributributory negligent in the motor Vehicle Accident because the lights in his vehicle were not operated when it was approached the road and he failed to draw any attention to himself or to the accident. The evidence of the plaintiff as she neared the intersection showed no signs of 'hot shock' or of 'white heat' as the term is defined in the Traffic Accident Investigation Manual'. The defendant had preformed minimal study on lamp examination and had no experience in the subjects of collision analysis. He admitted that he remembered the flashing lights at the police cruiser at the accident scene. He also admitted that his wife was in pain. The parties were in a common law relationship and they had spent the evening hours visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The motor vehicle incident occurred when a police vehicle crossed the intersection without a signal light in operation and struck the plaintiff vehicle. The female plaintiff suffered damage to her car and was hospitalized for several days. The defendants claim the plaintiff was contributorial negligent for failing to properly monitor and maintain the lights at all times. The Court cannot accept the evidence of a witness who was clearly not qualified to express opinion in the manual. The failure of the defendants to obtain the required information from the plaintiff does not constitute bad faith. The destruction of the exhibits was not an action involving bad faith on the part of the officer. The determination of the plaintiffs' liability is based on the evidence which establishes the officer was qualified to offer his opinion in his testimony. The conclusion reached by the witness is that up to the motorveh accident the headlights in operation on the plaintiff Hawes vehicle were in good condition. The court cannot accept that the officer followed some of the directions in the Manual."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to have the matrimonial home divided equally. She was given one-half of the only asset the family had. If she pursued the 'ordinary case' regime, she would be awarded $25,000 against the matonial home. The husband was to claim exemption for his own house, which he had never lived in, and all of the assets which he held before the marriage. HELD: The husband's claim was dismissed for $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,944.1. The matrimonial home was divided equally prior to the marriage, when the wife was given the other half. This was not an unusual case. The wife had the benefit of the matramonial home during the marriage and it was divided between her and the husband. The court accepted the claim that the children of the marriage were exempt from the equal division regime, which the registrar of matrimony determined was unfair and inequitable."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He claimed that overtime and breaks were excessive and he was dismissed without notice. The plaintiff also claimed that he was owed an additional $3.00 for lunch breaks. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because of the employee's excessive hours of work and overtime. Dismissing the plaintiff’s claim without any complaint, that the defendant had failed to follow company policy regarding breaks and overtime and that the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. The court reviewed the company’S records and determined that the employee was owed $3,000 for every hour of overtime he worked on the days he was not paid and that he took a 15 minute break for lunch. The employee claimed that his breaks were for his meal and he also claimed an additional hour for his nap. Dismembering the action for wrongful dismissal was not warranted. The company had established that the employees were entitled to a 15minute break for their morning break and that they were also entitled to breaks for lunch on those days. The claim was dismissed."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs against his son. He sought party/party costs. The father sought costs out of the estate. The issues were not about the meaning of his mother's will but rather the possibility of that failure, brought to the attention of his sister. The issue was whether the will could be relied upon as an adequate accounting for the value of the condominium held jointly by the parents. The deceased's estate failed to provide an accounting for its loss of a share in the survivor's estate. When the father and his daughter first applied for party and/or party costs, the father sought to have his solicitor and client costs paid out of it. Alternatively, he sought party & party costs. In light of the present position of the father, Hand and his sister, those three parties will bear their own costs."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The Court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The plaintiff had been director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) for 5 years and had been the person ultimately responsible for the renovation to the building. The VTH had been under the purview of the CUPE since its creation in 1976. The administrator of the hospital had completely failed in his duty to provide an harassment free workplace. The hospital administrator, who had been out of the workplace for several months, was appointed director of a veterinary hospital in 2002. The following year, CUPe filed a grievance alleging that the director had refused to prevent harassment and was an active participant in the harassment of the complainant. The defendant CUPEC, which represents the plaintiff, filed a second grievance. The second grievance alleged that the administrator had actively harassed the complainant and that the plaintiff was being 'patriotic' and had taken steps to prevent and prevent harassment. The Court accepted the defence of incompetent privilege."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. He had attended a police station to report an accident and reported to a Constable Louvel of the Regina City Police. The Constable had earlier received the statement of other witnesses involved in the accident. When the Constable arrived at the station to issue an appearance notice, there had been no rights to counsel or caution as there had not been any since the accident report. The accused had reported to the Constable the accident happened and had reported the incident to the Regina Police. Constable Loulev was asked to assist the officer with the accident investigation. The officer was issued an appearance warning and issued an interim appearance notice. The Court of Appeal appealed the conviction. HELD: Appeal allowed. conviction set aside. A new trial ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and arguedbefore the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. 2)Objections to the admissibility of the accused'sstatements based upon s.7 of the Charter raise a different issueand different considerations from the application to common law concepts of voluntariiness. There may also be a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voir dire in order to establish the foundation for the Charter argument. In the end, the appropriate approach was that taken by the Court of the Appeal in the Pelletier case directing a new trial be ordered."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. He was stopped for a traffic light, failed to appear at the scene of the accident, and was charged in provincial court with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle. The accused was 19 years of age and had a minor youth record that included six speeding convictions. He had been involved in night of drinking and partying without sleep. He consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive. The accident occurred when he was driving a light colored Audi, which was operating a motorbikes, at high speeds. The two passengers in the vehicle were killed. The driver of the other vehicle, who was in the middle of the highway, accelerated and skidded into the intersection, striking and killing a pedestrian. He entered a probation program and was prohibited from driving for 18 months. HELD: The accused is sentenced to imprisonment in the community for 90 days. 1)The accused's driving was amply conductable. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him and to allow his passage were either the major factors contributing to his dangerous driving. 2)The evidence showed that the accused had consumed significant quantities of alcohol. He drove a vehicle that was mechanically unsound and took the risk of running into a concrete barrier. He failed to monitor his passage and was consuming alcohol and non-prescription drugs.

9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants sought an order for the Court to exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs also sought an Order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiffs’ claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the issues of liability and assessment of damages was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. The defendant would not solicit any of the defendants’ clients or employees, other than few specified clients. The Court found that this joint venture required confidentiality and disclosure. The disclosure sought by the plaintiffs would reveal information about other of the defendant’s family corporations who were strangers to the litigation. The judgment for damages was set aside."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit and had been a member for 10 years. He testified that he monitored a number of file sharing networks, including one used by the accused, for the purposes of a search warrant. The ICE Unit was involved and the accused was detained. The Court found that the Internet Childexploitation unit was involved, as was the residence of the accused. The residence was searched and the ICE team entered the residence at 12:13 p.m. on October 15, 2014. During that time, the Internet child Exploitations Unit was also involved. The first officer testified that the accused downloaded Shareaza on his computer, connected to the internet, searched for and found vile child abuse videos, downloaded the files and shared them with the world. The second officer testified as to how the system could have been able to identify the packets of information. The third officer testified through his ICE program that he could not locate the accused because the home was often used as a base for the sharing of files. The officer testified on the Internet that he was unable to locate the person who, when contacted by the Internet, would suggest that the person was trying to access the Internet through a shared computer. The search warrant authorized the search of the entire duplex and the Court found the accused had in his possession child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The Internet Child Explorer Unit was used to search the premises. The court found that most of the time, when the accused visited the residence, he was using a computer, which was a computer with an internal IP address, which allowed him to access files from the Internet. The internet connection between the residence and the Internet was also an important connection for the Internet to be navigated. The fact that the residence was often occupied by someone who was viewing files from a third party and could not be reached by the internet connection, and that the internet was a bridge between the Internet and the home, which facilitated the transmission of messages, created an impression of openness and discovery of child abuse, and facilitated the viewing of child porn. The arrest was made on a warrant issued for the accused's viewing of a third-party file sharing network (IPNA). The warrant authorized a search of a second-floor apartment. The evidence showed that the home had a large amount of Internet Protocol (IPA) addresses, which could be used to access a third computer, and a"

The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","HELD: The court granted interim spousal support of $500 per month. The respondent agreed to split the child support payments and to pay child support of the petitioner $1,200 per month, plus $500 for spousals and child care expenses. The parties did not reach an agreement on all issues. The court ordered the payment of half of the child tax benefit payable in the amount of $1 million to the petitioner. The petitioner was to pay spousousal and child support in the sum of $400 per month and the respondent $500 in spousol. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and policy considerations and found the petitioner to have a Guideline income of $87,178 and the petitioner a figure of $18,884. The spousalist parent claimed that child support should be set aside and that the respondent was entitled to some spousaling in the event of a statutory break-off. The Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines provide that in a shared custody arrangement, each parent is assumed to receive their entitlement to the child benefit and the parties shall have joint custody of the children. The SSAG calculation for the parties is the same as for all communications in furtherance of settlement except for the declaration of spousaled parentage. The chart above depicts the parties' meeting at which they reached agreement on seven issues. HELD: 1) The respondent was to receive his entitlement to child tax credit. 2) The petitioner is to pay Spousals of $350 per month payable in September 2012 and payable in November 2013. 3) The parties have three children. They now have shared parenting arrangement. The petition in this matter was issued April 11, 2012. The four-way meeting occurred August 30, 2012 and the defendant is to have joint possession of the family home. The monthly cashflow is after income tax, CPP and EI premiums. The table of contents is the bottom and top of the range (in monthly amounts) for each instance. The calculations are based on the respondent's SSAGs and indicate that if the parties have reached an agreement, they will grant the respondent interim exclusive possession of that home. 4) The monthly income is after SSAAs and after deductibles. 5) The SAGEG calculation is the lowest and best in the range for a shared parenting plan and is based on a formula used in Tucker-Lester v. Lester (2012 SKQB 443). The SAAG calculation ranges from low of $36 per month to high of $"
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant applied for damages of $409,250.00. The jury trial was limited to assessing damages by the defendant's expert evidence. The plaintiff sustained multiple injuries including concussion, whiplash, fractured ribs, contusions and abrasions. She was rendered unconscious and remained in a state of post-traumatic amnesia for approximately 4 hours. The trial judge awarded damages for a period of 6 months. The appellant challenged the trial judge's decision to award the sum of $5,553.18 as being outside the limitation period. She also challenged the award of $724,000 as being in excess of the amount awarded for lost wages. Application dismissed; the trial court had no jurisdiction to assess the damages. The expert evidence was admissible. The judge's reasoning was that if the plaintiff had not been disabled, she would have continued to work and to receive salary or wages at periodic intervals until retirement, lay-off, or death. The evidence was that the plaintiff's position in the workplace was far from impaired. The fact that she was still employed by her pre-accident employer and may have continued for longer periods of time did not disqualify her from taking part in the jury trial. The award of damages was restricted to those with a history of working in the field of medicine."

Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002.

The proposal was granted a conditional variance and the building was subsequently rented out to separate groups of students. The owner of the property sought to have the building converted to a single unit dwelling and sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: The dwelling was in contravention of the Land Use By-Laws. The Court ordered that the owner pay a fine, costs of the taxation of the costs of this application and any compliance with the order. 1)The applicant was found in contempt pursuant to the Land USE By-laws. The court found that the applicant had willfully and intentionally sought to avoid the order by making these infractions. 2)The Court ordered the establishment of a rent registry on the property and ordered random inspections of the premises to ensure compliance. The inspection would be bi-monthly and the results of the inspections would be assessed as result of the breach. 3)The court found no reason why the applicant should not be required to provide HRM with the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he should provide HRMs with the name of the person who has signed the lease. 4)The respondent was found to have consented to the order which was complied with. The application was adjourned for time served pending the outcome of the city's investigation. 5)The application was allowed in part on the basis that the respondent had consented. The respondent conducted himself post granting of the order in a manner which found as fact he willfully and intentional sought to evade the order to which he consented and which will foster compliance with this order.

2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the landlord and the tenant contained an arbitration clause. The tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The landlord and tenant disputes over damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair. The issues were whether the arbitration agreement was properly set aside, whether the decision of the tribunal was patently unreasonable, and whether estoppel should be applied against the tenant. The arbitrator found the landlord liable to the tenant in the amount of $318,252.00 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity. The lease was amended and then assigned to Loblaws. On the expiry of the lease, the Tenant vacated. The owner contested the award, claiming that the arbitrators jurisdiction was exceeded by the jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement. The court held that the arbitration clause in the lease was a limited arbitration clause, which allowed the court to determine the award in accordance with the requirements of the general conditions dispute resolution. The decision was pathetically unreasonable. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. The Court held that it was the arbiter's responsibility to determine who was responsible for repairs, who was liable, and to apply the principles of waiver and estoppela against the Tenants. The arbitration clause under the lease is a limited one, which allows the court the discretion to deal with the disputes in a commercial context. The awards are awarded in the amounts of $300,000 for repairs to the property and $60,000 to the Tenancy. The award would withstand judicial review. The factors for assessing jurisdiction are the same in Lester, Paccar and Corn Growers. The Supreme Court of Canada held that when the arbitator referred to immunity from judicial review he was referring only to the award and not the interpretation of clauses of the collective agreement, which interpretation must not be patently unrealistic. The principles of waivers and estopel apply as against the applicant."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The law firm was concerned that the screening measures taken by the law office were so quickly that they may have not actually occurred. There was no risk to anyone else in the law practice. The screening measures were necessary to ensure that no disclosure to any member of the new law firmof the former client's confidential information will occur. The members of the law school swore an affidavit in 1998 that they had not had any discussions with anyone associated with the new firm concerning the Magnes and L. matters and that they would not discuss those matters with anyone within the law company or the firm. The applicant's affidavit in 1999 was found to be unreliable. The evidence filed in this case was that all the screening steps were taken by Olive Waller to ensure no disclosure would occur. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence filed was conclusive that all of the screening procedures were necessary. There were no breaches of the confidentiality provisions of the Act. 2)The applicant was a reasonable member of society and her presence at the law offices was sufficient to ensure she did not have any further contact with her former clients. 3)The screening measures, while necessary, were not enough to ensure there was no disclosure. There must be independently verifiable procedures which have been taken to ensure such disclosure will occur, so long as the screening measure is in place."
e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while over.08 contrary to ss. 255 and 253 (1)(b) of that Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court held that the accused’s Charter claim was based on reasonable grounds as opposed to on-the-cuff denial. The officer did have reasonable ground to arrest the accused for impaired driving and to make demand for breath samples. The Court concluded that the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The court found that the officer subjectively believed that he had reasonable grounds in the meaning of s. 254(3) of The Code to arrest and to Make demand for Breath Sample. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor did he have the grounds to arrest for impaired impaired driving, thus the arrest was unlawful, the search was unlawful and the rights of the accused were violated. The admission of evidence would enhance rather than detract from the public’S and of the charter’ s. and would be in the best interests of the innocent."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision pursuant to s. 62.1 and s.62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the appellant and its employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. The appeal based on the submission that the adjudicated erred in law by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated by Kovach's conduct is dismissed. 2)The second ground of appeal based upon the adjudicating exceeding his jurisdiction also failed. In the appellant's view, the adjudication applied the proper principles of Law to thefacts, as they found them. The adjudicator did not at any time examine his lease (which was not produced at the hearing) with the franchisor/Zellerers in order in orderto determine whether, if so, whether the adjudicators exceeded his jurisdiction in holding that the appellant, as Kovach\'s employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a situation of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work. The second ground was not relevant and the adjudicative applied the standard standard of review of patently unreasonable error. 3)The Court found that the Court exceeded its jurisdiction by not intervening when the adjudicate's findings of facts were incorrect. The Court found the adjudicator did not err in law in determining that the respondent's employment contract had not frustrated or been fundamentally breached. The Appeal Court was unable to substitute its own view of the evidence for that of the trier of fact. The decision of the adjud adjudicator was not patently incorrect."

Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided.

The appeal was allowed in part per reasons for Hamilton, J.A.,; Roscoe and Cromwell, JJ.A. concurring.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement, 1930, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with a search light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate aboriginal peoples' right (s. 11(3)) and correctly identified it. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. 2)The accused had failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test pursuant to Sparrow. The trial judge did not refer to the Sparrow test in s.7(3). The test is the test set out in R. v. Bernard (1999) and expanded in the subsequent authorities. 3)The court was unable to accept the appellant's argument that the conviction was against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence; that the accused's Aboriginal right was not infringed; that there was no infringement of aboriginal rights; that they enjoyed a protected aboriginal right independent of s.35(1) of The Constitution Act, 1982; and that they had an Aboriginal interest in hunting food. 4)The evidence did not support the conclusion that night hunting with artificial lights was not part of any aboriginal hunting right and even if s.11.1 was infringed, it was justified because of the strong safety factor. The court was not seeking to invalidate the trial decision. 5)The issue on appeal was whether s.12 of the Regulations was a prima facie infringement of the appellation's aboriginal right to hunted for food. The issue on this appeal was the issue of whether the accused, as Metises, were subject to s.(8)the same regulations passed by the Province of Saskatchewan which protect the occupation of land and the activities which are integral to the distinctive aboriginal culture of the group claiming the right. The Court was unable, in its view, to accept that the evidence did support the trial court's conclusion that the restricted legislation did not infringe aboriginal rights. The appeal could not be taken to the Supreme Court on a question of law."

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The applicant landlord sought compensation for a breach of her statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The applicant's home was damp and riddled with mould, with the result that some of her belongings were ruined. A bylaw inspector visited the premises and found that the landlords had allowed mould to develop in the premises, without proper ventilation and failed to rectify the problem.

The mother of two children, who was also affected by the mould, attended the hearing and appealed. The plaintiff brought an application for compensation against the landlord. The issues before the court was to determine damages and costs. HELD: The plaintiff's damages were rejected. 1) On a general basis they should be valued at less than $1,200. The damages were so high that it was impossible to believe the applicant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. 2) The plaintiff was not credible and her explanation was not probable. The Director's evidence was discounted. There was no evidence of age on the basis of which the general claim was discounted or discounted. 3) The furniture was not damaged. It was simply the worn fabric of the children's clothing that was ruined. 4) The Director was essentially correct in discounting the value of the rug and clothing. She was not giving evidence on a legitimate basis. The general claim of $1.200 was also discounted."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The survivings spouse received an income replacement benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her deceased husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench Court as provided by the Automotive Accident insurance adjusters. HELD: The application was dismissed with interest.  1)The simplest formula for calculating the death benefits for dependent children is the same as in Division 4. The only difference is that SGI has calculated the payment based on percentage of the deceased's net incomes rather than his gross incomes. 2)The only income replacement benefits that the Act could refer to is one that is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis. The difference is the death Benefit is 50% if the deceased is 65% of that net income.  3)The interpretation suggested by SGI was appropriate was that of the Income Replacement Benefits set out in s146(1) of the Act. The legislation is clear that the calculation in s 146(1 is an exact formula for the purposes of s146. The formula is the formula set out by the Act in s142. The same formula is used in Division 5 of the Health Benefits Act. 4)The deceased was entitled to a lump sum payment of $603 per week payable every 14 days. SGE was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 5)The death benefit is 50 per cent of the respondent's actual gross yearly employment income. The death benefit was 50% of the applicant's income replacement fund.  6)Costs were awarded on the basis of interest."
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender. It complained the defendant had not treated it fairly in awarding the contract to Nielsen Ashdown. The defendant sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist in the contract. The person who invites the tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally. It was based on factors relevant to the project: the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get the contract; and 2)Curniski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.  3)The implied term and the implied term are compatible. The privilege clause entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount, the amount and experience of the tenderers, the equipment used on that project, and the reasons for rejecting the tender, in order to determine who should receive the contract. 4)The project was first for the defendant and the plaintiff complained the defendants had not done fairly in award the contract and sued for damage. It is settled law that the submission of tender in response a request to tender may give rise to contractual obligations depending upon whether the parties intend to initiate contractual relations by the submission or not. The plaintiffs compensated by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor, a fact Stanley did not know at the time, regardless of the fact it was the lowest tenderer on the list."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted. The children were to be returned to the father by the end of 2008 with a condition that they be returned immediately to their mother. The father would continue living with the mother and take anger management courses and take courses on anger management and cooking. The evidence showed that the father had 16 previous youth offences as youth. The reasons for the order were various factors including the mother's failure to follow through with parenting services, noncompliance with parenting related policies and noncompliance of the Harm Reduction Methadone Program. The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but the father proposed that he would continue to live with the father while the mother worked and attend anger management classes and take parenting classes. The issues were the mother’s failure to pay child support and the father’d failure to comply with his own addiction treatment. HARD: The evidence was overwhelming. The parents were in breach of the terms of the PSA. HOLD: The children had been in the care of the Ministry for most of their lives and the evidence was conclusive that the parents had not been in contact with the Agency for Support and Education (AAS) since the birth of the child. The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the mother was in breach because the father was not paying attention to the children’ s needs and had failed to meet his probation and release conditions. The court reviewed the history of the parents and found it was important to ensure that the children continued to have appropriate access to the services they were required to receive and that they would be responsible for their own health and safety. The Ministry was awarded a $1,000 judgment against the mother for failing to provide proper support and counselling. The child’S future plans were uncertain."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. The issue is whether the recognizANCE should be granted again. The accused is a repeat sexual offender. He is a person of interest to the Court. He has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched in the bush. He had 12 assault related convictions. His current sentence is set aside. He will enter parole in November. The Court reviewed the officer's testimony and the accused's written material and found that the accused has a subjective belief that he will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault. The issues are the same. The officer's written evidence is unreliable. The judge was unable to review and compare the officer’s written material. The psychological and psychiatric assessment reports and the parole officer”s written report are unreliable. There were inconsistencies in the officer and the judge” s.810.2(3) of the Criminal Code. The RCMP” wrote material that was found to support the Crown” on the basis that the officer had a subjective and objective belief that the defendant will commit a serious offence or a sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years. The court found that both the officer (the accused and the officer) had subjective and subjective belief the accused would commit a sexual offence or an assault offence. The objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the person”d” the accused”e”t be of good behaviour. The subjective and objectively” objective component” to the accused belief that his fears are reasonable and should be established by the Crown. The fact that the objective person (the officer) was unable and unwilling to dispute the officer was right. The evidence was based on objective fact and was not sufficient to address the underlying risk factors of substance abuse, domestic violence and sexual offending. The judicial focus was on the accused and his future plans were jeopardizing the safety of the community."
c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. They were unanimous in their opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentencing must be dismissed. HELD: The appeal against the conviction was dismissed.  1) The transcripts of court proceedings were not available to the court and the Court would not subpoena certain witnesses whom you wished to call to testify. Since the accused was fully and fairly put, it cannot be said that you did not have a fair trial. 2) The sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). In 1990, she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. This was the basis of a claim in both tort and contract. The statement of claim alleged that the defendant, Dow Chemical, breached its duty to disclose the risk inherent to the breast implant. The plaintiff alleged that Dow Chemical caused the damage by negligently and without properly informing her of the risks, her health and well-being were lost. In addition, the plaintiff alleged there was a causal connection between the alleged failure to disclose and her injuries. HELD: The application was dismissed. The defendant was ordered to pay $1,000 to the plaintiff and have her taxable costs in any event of the cause. 1)The statement of claims did disclose wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant. The defendants were at law responsible for the liabilities of the plaintiff. The statements of claim did not disclose an actionable wrong on the defendant but it did disclose a causal relationship between that conduct and the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff based upon the defendant's denunciation of her actions. 2)Dow chemical was at law liable for the liability of the defendants in both contract and tort. The Court did not have jurisdiction over that defendant on the basis that it had subsidiaries in the USA and overseas. 3)DOW Chemical was at issue in the Saskatchewan action. It was argued that the statement of claimed damages were caused by the defendant and that the defendants breached their duty to disclosure. The Statement of Claim did disclose some wrongful conduct by the defendants and there was causal connection with that conduct. The court held that it did not hold jurisdiction over the defendant on a basis of common law. 4)Dowell Chemical was the defendant in the manufacture and distribution of breast implants. The plaintiffs actions were dismissed."

The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800. Revenue Canada objected, requesting a conditional order for monthly payments of $750 over 4 years. HELD: Conditional order of discharge granted. The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income. Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","This was a discharge application for another bankrupt who was self employed and who was unable to pay his taxes through indifference, disregard and neglect. The trustee calculated surplus income of $435 per month and recommended a conditional order requiring the payment of $7800. The bankrupt had a horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligations stretching back at least 15 years. HELD: A conditional order was ordered requiring the bankrupt to pay $500 per month by monthly installments of $500. The right of prepayment exists. Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income he also does not file his returns. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy.

The applicant sought summary judgment for the alleged failure in the quarters 2, 3 and 4 of the agreement. The court granted summary judgment but refused to grant it a reduction in costs. The affiant was an expert retained by the defendant to provide an opinion on the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal by the plaintiff. The expert advised the plaintiff that he was unable to carry out the analysis due to the insufficiency of materials.

The defendants claim that they have 'low Sodium' products but they have no longer stated that they are low sodium. HELD: The application for summary judgment is dismissed. 1) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that the claim was not supported by the evidence. 2) The facts are undisputed. The statements made by the plaintiff are not mere hunches. The adulation of the plaintiff by the defendants is not the only conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence; the Court found that there is a real issue to be had in this case. The Court held that it is of considerable authority for the Court to hear summary judgment application prior to the certification application. There is no application before the Court with respect to claims as a class as whole. It would be potentially open for other representative plaintiffs to come forward by issuing a new claim under the Class Actions act. 3) The Facts are undisputable. The Statements by the Defendants are Interpretive. The Facts do not Represent the Claim. The Defendants have not stated that the Low The Low Sodium Beverages are Low Sodium. The wording of the Statements by The Defendants is very similar to that of other, regularly packaged products who do not include a Low Sodium Label. The Appeal Court in Hryniak v. Mauldin set out two separate issues to address when considering if summary judgment was appropriate (whether a genuine issue existed; and (ii) whether its resolution requires conventional trial. The issues at hand are the facts, the facts at hand, the factors at hand and the fact that the consumer expect a product that is mean in sodium. The advertising is misleading and the attributes of the product she obtained (as opposed to the relative attributes of competing products) were in any way different from those she had been led to expect. The facts, including the wording of each statement, were straightforward and the"
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiff, the defendant corporation, in the business of building decks and sunrooms, applied the law of frustration in May 2004. The plaintiff had received a detailed quotation from the defendant company and had been unable to reach an agreement on the project. The defendant then approached the plaintiff and proposed to construct a glass sunroom. The plaintiffs refused and the defendant took the money from the plaintiff. The defendants then sued the plaintiff for the return of the $2,200 deposit they had given to the defendant. The parties were unable to come to an agreement as the defendant had relied on the plaintiff's contractors experience and the plaintiff had mortgaged its future home to pay the defendant's $2 million deposit. The contract between the plaintiff, and the Defendant, was frustrated. The court found that a just and reasonable resolution demanded that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties in a 65/35 ratio. The Court awarded judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the amount of $3,604.22. The doctrine of frustration operates as an excuse for the non-performance of contractual obligation. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant and the defendants. Both parties acted in good faith. The Defendant was required to pay $176.22 to the plaintiff but the amount was reduced to $176 because the plaintiff was required by law to pay its $2.5 million deposit and the costs of the construction were reduced to a mere $500. The damages were set aside for the plaintiff to recover against the defendant in the balance of damages."

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant appealed its conviction for selling tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act. The issues at trial involved the constitutionality of the Act and the defence of due diligence. The trial judge found that the Tobacco Act was ultra vires the Legislature and was therefore unconstitutional. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the matter for trial, that the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. He concluded that federal legislation had occupied the field with the Tobacco act and was thus dominant.

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions.

The Crown appealed on the ground that the summary conviction appeal court decision had erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzers result under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The respondent appealed on grounds that the stop was an improper exercise of his right to counsel pursuant to s. 9 of the Canadian Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that the wording of the Saskatchewan Act and the Saskatchewan Police Act do not constitute reasonable and probable grounds to justify random stops. The broad wording of s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act and its authorized breathalycers is not the only reason why the stop should be justified."

The court was presented with no case authority in which court has ever made an order allowing video conferencing for the benefit of specific non-participating persons within Saskatchewan let alone another province. This is a moment of unprecedented opportunity for the court to consider and consider the application in detail.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The Provincial Court declined the accused's application for interim detention on the grounds that the accused was in the community awaiting trial and would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown sought a determination of two preliminary issues: 1) whether the Youth Court judge in the Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused’s application for judicial interim release; and 2) whether this honourable court had jurisdiction as a review judge. HELD: The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender’’ Act had now replaced the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The issue then became for a young person charged with murder to face trial on an offence set out in s. 469 of the Code.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault or whether she should be convicted for one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assaulted. The court found that the mens rea required for common assault is identical. All that is required is an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring the victim. This is simply not believable. The accused is guilty of aggravated assaulting."

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's card and featured a field of eight horses.

Application allowed; decision quashed; matter remitted back to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. The Commission's decision to refuse to give notice of the hearing was pathetically unreasonable.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000. CIBC lost the entire $24,000 due to a rather intricate kiting system.

Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year from March 1, 1990 if either party gave notice of termination three months prior to the date of the lease.

The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option.

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had.

He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced rectification of the contract. The defendant employee admitted he had not included a basement price in the contract but claimed the price was included in the price of the RTM and basement. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendants were entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)The plaintiff cannot accept the defendant'sversion of events. The claim for rectification was dismissed because the defendants knew or ought to have known that an RTM does not come with a basement and that the price quoted by the defendant was incorrect. 2)The defendant knew nothing of the price in June 1992 and that there was no agreement to include a basement. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and I am not satisfied that therewas an agreement reached by the parties to pay interest. The evidence was that there were two levels of agreement. The first level was agreement to price basement. 4)The second level was determination of the amount of interest payable by the defendants. The court was not satisfied by the evidence that there had been any agreement between the parties. The parties were of one mind. The common intention or agreement was not to price a basement or to include the RTMs. The Court was not able to accept that in his meticulous review to ensure that all extras, some of which were priced at few hundred dollars, were accounted for, he overlooked a $19,000 item. 5)The court was unable to accept the plaintiff's version of events which was that he faxed a price on an RT m and basement but that the notation of May 18 and July 18 was incorrect and the plaintiff should have taken the opportunity to correct it.  6)Costs of the settlement were reduced to $1,716.28 due to the plaintiff receiving erroneous information."

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from breaching the terms of its restrictive covenants by taking employment with Brennan.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to the applicant; 2)The injunctive relief sought was limited to the period immediately following the termination of the employment agreement. The court found that the applicant had not established a primacy case or a serious issues to be had in view of the numerous breaches it had already suffered. The application for an injunction was also dismissed.  3)The respondent was found to have breached its duty to protect its employees and suppliers by recruiting them and then soliciting them for its promotional activities.

The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

The respondent indicated that he expected the assessment to be extended to include an assessment of the accounts. The length of time between the time that the applicant requested the assessment and the time it was granted was in the interest of justice. The lawyer should have more specific information as to when the assessment would be ordered."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. The Crown called a counsellor who was counselloral on the complainant's behalf. She also testified that the appellant had fondled her breasts and inside her pants. The appellant's defence was complete denial of the allegations. Two medical doctors testified that, over the span of several years, the complainant had had vaginal and anal intercourse on numerous occasions. The Court of Appeal concluded that the expert evidence in this case was so reliable as to warrant an admissible opinion. Dismissing the appeal, that the evidence of an expert, in the nature of that given by Wollert as to the psychological and physical conditions that frequently arise as result of sexual abuse of a child, is admissible. The error was so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant, who stole his grandmother's car from her home and then drove to the Canada-U.S. border station, where he was arrested by border guards for attempting to cross into the US without permission, pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s.334 of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been previously sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a two year licence suspension. The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. The father appealed on the grounds that the sentencing judge did not take sufficient weight from the appellant's past and present substance use. Appeal allowed; sentence set aside; the appellant given leave to appeal. The affidavit filed by the father was not of significant probative value and the father's statements made in the pre-sentence report did not appear to have a significant role to play in the appellant rehabilitation process. The evidence presented by the defence was so incomplete that it was difficult to assess the father."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement: 'For periods totaling more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions contained in the Agreement will not be affected except for the disruption of payment and conveyance.' HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the instrument was a separation Agreement and the agreement provided for the parties to live separately for periods totaling not more than 60 days. Counsel proceeded with the view that the agreement would be void except in the event that the respondent reappeared in the courtroom and disrespected the petitioner's claim to spousals. Counsel then proceeded on on the ground that the separation agreement was a separate agreement and that they would neither claim spouseal support nor spousa support from The Issue resolved. HELD:(1) The Court found the respondent evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to questions.  1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason it gave for it were the only issues for the trial. The untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to residency and statements that he swore as true in his subsequent application for divorce judgment; (2) His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer.  3) The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The respondent emphasized a number of times that his desire was to see the family fully restored and together and that the employment he obtained in Melville, Saskatchewan finally permitted the family to be together in this province.  4) The respondent was evasive and argumentative in his answer to questions concerning the nature of the agreement in light of the narrow issue presented to the Court."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (Family Maintenance Act) which:a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner; and(b) restrorains the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation to the Action or any claim against the Attorney-General of Canada pending the petitioner's application or further court order; and, in the ex partee application, from releasing any monied assets which the petitioner had received or might receive in connection to the action or any other claim against Attorney- General of jurisdiction pending the respondent's application.HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the Act that was made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. The ex partere order was lifted as against the attorney-general. 1)The respondent argued that a restraining order granted under s8(1)(i) is a preservation of property order and should not be granted, whether ex parto or otherwise, because the petitioner has not met the tests that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. 2)The Court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMMA) and found that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order are identical to those that must to be considered an application in an inter-locutory application. The criteria for granting a preservation ordered are identical in s. 10 of The Interpretation Act. The Court was not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent or equitable jurisdiction applied to an application under s.(1)of the Act. If the criteria required to grant a restraining ordered pursuant to s. 45 of The Queen's Bench Act (the 'Act'), which has determined that the protection of dependants outweighs an individual's rights in property, it is unlikely that the full amount would be required to satisfy any claim under this Act. 3)The petitioner has exhausted all available means to ensure a secure and efficient way of dealing with her and the Children.  4)The court reviewed the history of injunctions in the context of the Matrimonial Property Act and determined that s. 25 of the Act was the most appropriate and appropriate venue. 5)The amount of money that the respondent could reasonably use to support his application would be"
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The mother, who had been the only family member who could secure loans to pay for her education, brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike the father's application. She sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order, both designed to cover the past educational costs. The father, who was the sole signatory to the original application, brought a new application pursuant under Rule 14.(d) to strike it. The mother sought consolidation so that one hearing could be held. Application to strike out the father dismissed; the father was entitled to costs. Although the father secured several loans to help pay for the daughter's education, the amount of relief was not known at the time of the application and there was no evidence that he paid any of the loans. The only thing that was known was that the daughter had secured a loan from the father and he was responsible for the repayments. The application to strike this application was dismissed. There was no material change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement. The applicant's application pursuant pursuant to rule 14.24 succeeded. The court reviewed the relevant corollary relief judgment and found that the father had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollaries relief and there were no circumstances to justify a strike. The applications to strike or to retroactively vary the child support provisions were found to be in breach of the corolary relief provisions."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial to prove the will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant has failed to meet the test contemplated by the procedural framework.  2) The test is based on a rebuttable presumption. Where there is a genuine issues to be tried, the propounder of the will must first satisfy the court that there isa genuine issue to be attempted, such that that the Court must then make a preliminary assessment of the merits of the matter. 3) The person challenging the will need not prove its case on a balance of probabilities or otherwise. He or she must bring forward evidence that challenges the presumption of validity and which would, if accepted at trial, tend to negative testamentary capacity or undue influence or otherwise defeat the will. The threshold for the challenge is reasonably low. 4) The court was satisfied there was insufficient evidence to establish a genuine Issue for trial."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.",The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information and he appealed the decision of the Appeal Board in September 2007. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date he was assessed. The Applicant sought further information from the applicant. The respondent refused to comply and the applicant was denied the appeal. The application for an order under the nature prescribed mandamus was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decisionof the Appeal board enforced. There must be a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and a duty owed must not be discretionary nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The Court granted the application for the application in the form of mandamamus compelling the respondent implement the Appeal's decision retroactive to June 2007.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.

Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","Civil Procedure – Rule 173 – Rule 165 The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the plaintiff's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claimed to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. 2) A conviction of self-defence is not necessary in an attempt to bring back the original law. The plaintiff bears the onus of proving his claim throughout the history of the law, on the evidence of the witnesses, on his evidence at trial, and on his ability to approach the court with such a complaint. 3) A victim who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in a later civil proceeding against the same defendant. The conduct of an accused in the criminal context is that his conduct may be considered an offence against the State or the Queen's peace. In civil proceedings it is wrong against the individual alone which is alleged and the law should not preclude plaintiff from proceeding civilly by the mere fact that a criminal charge against an accused with reference to the same conduct has been dismissed. Otherwise, the victim may not wish to report criminal activity as it may preclude his subsequent opportunity to proceed civilly. There are different parties in civil proceedings from criminal and of course, a different burden of proof. The defendant who punches someone in the nose is liable both for the tort of battery and the crime of assault. He may be sued by his victim for damages, and he may in addition be prosecuted by the Crown IN the criminal courts. His exercise would not be justified merely because the story told in the pleadings is highly improbable and one which it is difficult to believe could be proved. One who is convicted of criminal assault is not immune from later civil action for the damages resulting from that assault, but he will be excused from paying punitive damages to his victim."

The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention.

The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner.

HELD: The application for interim relief was dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month was ordered. This was in order to relieve the majority from the economic hardship they were experiencing. The court found that the respondent had the ability to pay spousals but the application was not made to relieve any of the economic hardships they were already experiencing. A substantial transfer of the respondent's assets would go a long way in alleviating the majority's economic hardship."

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits were available under s146(5). The deceased was not entitled in 1998 to any extra benefits and had been unemployed for 6 months prior to the accident. She was not employed and would not have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived.

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs.

d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant. The application alleged that the applicant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information had been obtained that indicated that the accountant had filed a false T3 in order for tax refunds. The applicant claimed the accountant's accounting records, including sales invoices, purchase orders, expense vouchers and supporting documents, were found at the applicant's place of business, located in his and the applicant’s residence, and in any storage facilities occupied by the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The applicant”s own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a search without the missing information. The employment records, which were not related to the charges before the Court, were not relevant. 2) The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading and new evidence were all relevant. Their sole impact was to determine whether there was any basis for the issuance or issue of a warrant. 3) The application for a return of the seized documents was dismissed because the applicant had not disclosed any of the information that he now knew to be erroneous.  4) The court found that the informant”d established reasonable and probable grounds for the search. The fact that he had correctly set out the relevant material in the employment report, the factual material, the probabilistic grounds for a search, the accuracy of the material, and the probable grounds to issue a search (as opposed to a search for fraudulent or fraudulent information) did not rise above the level of suspicion, conjecture, conjecture or 'fishing expeditions' to make out reasonable and reasonable and likely grounds for an order to search the applicant and his home."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).",The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action and was unsustainable. The AGC brought a motion for summary judgement on the basis that the statement of claims disclosed no reasonable cause and that the amended statement did not provide sufficient material facts to comply with the rules. HELD: The application was dismissed. The statement of claimed liability was dismissed because it did not offer sufficient material support or support the claim for damages. The amendments did not add to the statement as the statement was before the AGC and did not meet the test under Rule 14.25(1)(a) of the rules applicable to pleadings. The only reasonable conclusion was that the undertaking could not have been founded on the evidence of a conviction.

A competitor, operating through the appellant company, acquired the claims of 18 creditors and voted them over the objections of the respondent at a meeting of the creditors, defeating the proposal. Only two of the 16 remaining creditors opposed the proposal. The Registrar disallowed the appellant's votes, and found the proposal had been accepted by the votes of the remaining creditors. The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant attempted to abuse the provisions of the Act by using them to interfere for an improper purpose with the proposal of a debtor to its creditors. The Registrar made no error in discerning this from the evidence and in exercising the court's discretionary jurisdiction to remedy this substantial injustice.","The respondent made a proposal to its creditors under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A competitor had entered bankruptcy and the respondent obtained the claims of eighteen creditors. Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal. Only one of the creditors represented by the appellant voted pro. The respondent appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction should not be invoked to interfere in proposal to creditors underthe BIA when it appears the statutory process is being used for purposes not contemplated by Parliament.

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation.

The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than 1-half the amount submitted in The Joint recommendation. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed. The joint recommendation was a fit sentence. The Court noted the agreement between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the joint recommendations were not a repudiation of an agreement which resulted from a process of plea negotiation.

On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions of the Board's case management division and appeals committee. HELD: The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. 1) The impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction so that there was no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving the applicant with an adequate alternative remedy. The issues are whether each of the impugning decisions was made without jurisdictional jurisdiction, whether that is mandamus directing the Board to pay benefits to the applicant, and in what circumstances the application is made. 2) The legislature has chosen to establish the workers' compensation system as an self-contained system, with no right of appeal to the courts beyond the final decision of the board. The legislature regarded this as sufficient in matters of workers' Compensation, likely because of the extensive system that it established in the Act. 3) The applicant has an adequate alternate remedy available to him. No special circumstances, that might justify judicial intervention, have been presented. An order in certioraris is not available to the application because nothing in the April 2005 letter or the April 5, 2005 reply from the appeals committee changes the committee's conclusion that the applicant is fit for employment. 4) The letters are neither part of the original impugns nor part of his evidence.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. The plaintiff also claims damages for breachof an employment contract when the plaintiff employed Sullivan as a consultant. Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September 2005. The defendant's company was the successful bidder. The trial judge found that Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff and did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to profit margins, etc. of the plaintiff. Sullivan had already had all the experience he would have been required to have completed the work for PC S. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to costs against the plaintiff, the plaintiff is awarded costs against Sullivan and the plaintiff's costs against each defendant are awarded against each party. The court was unable to distinguish the Sullivan's actions from those of the Restauronics Services Ltd. v. Forster. The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his employment. The Court held that the plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. The placing of the bid went beyond preparation. The fact that the applicant had telephoned the union hall and was told there were no members available to work for the plaintiff showed that the employer was not seeking to alienate the employee from its employ. The employee's bid met the employer’s expectations and the court awarded $500 to the plaintiff for the loss of employment."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found that the delay from 1991 to 1998 (when the University’s insurer was prosecuting the action) was not problematic. However, the delay between 1999 to 2005 was both inordinate and inexcusable. The Chambers judge nonetheless concluded it was not in the interests of justice to strike the action for delay. The issue on appeal was whether the action should be struck for delay as the Chambers judge reviewed the issues in International Capital Corp. v. Schafer and found that while the delay in 1999 to 2006 was inexcusably long, the time between the start of the action and the 2005 collapse was not as long as it would have been if the university’d been in charge of the project."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.

The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1) While his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol was impaired, he did not wish to pursue his first course of action. Having consumed alcohol of such a high concentration that the concentration of his blood in 100 mgs could not conceivably have provided assistance to the Court on this issue. 2) The destruction of video evidence did not breach the accused's right to make full answer and defence. 3) The accused's rights to counsel were breached. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest he wanted to consult with another lawyer. Accordingly, the officer was justified in assuming he was satisfied. 4) There was no breach of the accused’s right to counsel."

Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in the City of Regina. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was found to have a whiplash injury which, according to medical evidence, had resolved over a period of about one year following the accident. Liabilities were not in dispute. The trial judge allowed pecuniary expenditures of $1,989.82 allowed. No evidence was tendered in respect of her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear that she was substantially disabled prior to the accident; nor did she require surgery to correct the problem. No weight was given to the doctor's conclusion as to her present state as she had regained her pre-accident state after being hospitalized for a mild case of MVA related problem.

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time.

The petitioner had lost her sight in 2001 and had been continuously employed on part-time basis for the past 3 years.

He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who thought that there were dead tuna fish in the tuna pen. He insisted on performing his dive, using diving equipment borrowed from the owner of the boat. Although the defendant was not present on the day of the accident, he was a member of the crew and was responsible for the fish while the others were fishing. The defendant was recruited by the defendants to fish with him and the defendant in a tuna pen in the Atlantic Ocean. HELD: The defendant is not guilty of the offence charged. The Court found that the defendant not guilty. The definition of 'dependent contractor' in s.3(j) is that a person, whether or not employed under contract of employment and whether or Not, is dependent on another person in order to bring them within the definition of an employer. The facts do not establish a relationship between a dependent contractor and the employee within the meaning of the Act. The fact that the accused was recruited and he insisted on doing it against the advice of others more knowledgeable and experienced was a classic case of someone being the author of his own misfortune and to hold the defendant or any of his co-fishers responsible for his health and his safety would be to arrogate to them a degree of control they did not possess."

The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm.

An appraisal of the farm land and out buildings was done and the report filed. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the respondent's testimony was accepted. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years the respondent has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. 2) The respondent sold his trailer and the proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. However, when consider the testimony of the father, he was the actual owner of the tractor. He is not the father of the machinery. 3) The petitioner is entitled to add $2,400 to her account for the cost of the sale of the vehicle. 4) The Court did not take into account the uncle's ownership of the truck or the tractor as being family property, as he owned one. The father owned a line of machinery of significant value. The Court held that the respondent owned a similar line of work which was done on the farm. The fact that the petitioner owned the furniture and it was exempt from the tariffs does not change the fact that this line of farm machinery is owned by the respondent. 5) The father is the sole owner of a tractor which appears in the 2000 capital cost allowance schedule as well as in the 1999 one. He sold his tractor in 1999 and the sale proceeds of that were used in that amount. The amount of the mortgage on the tractor is $1,200. The court rejected the father's assertion that he owned a tractor at the time of the marriage and accepted his testimony that he sold his truck in 1999. The family home is an acreaged property and is owned and operated by the petitioner. The residence is owned with the exception of one vehicle. It was purchased from an uncle and owned by him. The vehicle was owned by his father. The owner of one of the vehicles is not an uncle. The tractor is owned in the home.

The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home.

It found that it did not have a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right that the applicant might have. The balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, which was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) It is clear the truck is used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. The Court may take into account the impact that an order of forfeiture may have on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling house was the member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence, and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence. 2) It was clear the vehicle was owned and paidfor through a Loan from his parent. The Appeal Court did not grant forfeiture. The respondent was nearly 22 years old at the offence and had no prior record. He had no previous record. The Crown put street value on the drugs of between $2000 and $3000, with the respondent valuing the drugs at slightly under $2000. The truck was owned, paid for by the father and paid through a $1,000 loan from the mother. The court found that the father was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. He noted the respondent was depressed. The appeal against the length of sentence was dismissed and the appeal of the failure to order forfeited was allowed but the Court could not find proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property. 3) The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned for the respondent by the parents. He paid for the vehicle through a loans from his father. The mother registered no liens to protect her interests."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that it could not rely on the standard of review offered by the appellant in its decision to exclude the respondent from the consideration of gradual onset stress claims. The appellant argued that the policy was wrong to use the term 'accident' in the context of gradual start stress. WCAT also failed to give weight to the opinion of the Workers' compensation Appeals Tribunal's treating psychologist in the absence of any evidence to rebut that opinion. The appeal turned on two main issues. The first was whether the policy should be applied to decisions made on or after July 25, 2005. The second was whether WCAT erred in failing to give enough weight to an objective assessment of workplace events and stressors. The respondent Board did not err in relying on the term accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. WCATA applied the correct legal test according to the reasonableness standard. The policy is based on the best available evidence. The Court reviewed the history of the legislation and found that the respondent Board adopted the policy in accordance with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable and there was uncertainty about whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing the workplace stressors in the workplace. WCats adopted the Policy based on a different set of factors, including the respondent board's decision to not include the respondent in the consideration package. The decision was consistent with the broad approach to the workplace injury claims in the past and was consistent throughout with the policy. The Board adopted a different reasonablity standard. It adopted a policy that addressed gradual onset onset stress. The Policy sets out certain conditions that are compensable under GECA and sets out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The principles very clearly enunciate the objectives and goals of the GECA. The fact that the applicant was entitled to benefits under GEP despite having suffered a personal injury by accident does not mean that he is not compensable for his work related injuries. The applicant's claim for 'disasters of loss of income and loss of pension entitlement' is also subject to the Policy. The court reviewed the record and found there was no evidence that the claims were compensable at the time they were made. The claim for gradual onset trauma was dismissed on appeal. The appeals court agreed with the Appeal Commissioner and held that the Policy is declaratory of the policy and should be interpreted in the"

The father must be permitted to retain enough of his income to provide a subsistence living for himself.","FIAT. The mother sought child support for the child. She sought to pay child support of $160 per month. The father paid child support in an interim order. HELD: The child was to be paid monthly. The support guidelines suggested an annual obligation of $1,907.50 ($159.00 per month) for the father at the father's level of income. Such a payment would leave him with $1010 per month after he had paid his income tax, Canada Pension Plan and Unemployment Insurance contributions. That is barely sufficient to maintain a subsistence level but he will have to manage as best he can. Obviously the public purse must continue to bear most of his support obligation.

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","The plaintiff insurer, which represented the defendant defendant, failed to disclose the existence of a second insurance policy under which the plaintiff obtained a cancellation notice of cancellation. The defendant insurer, Marsh, had previously placed a policy on the plaintiff which protected her interests and the interests of the mortgagee. The plaintiff commenced foreclosure proceedings against the defendant insurer after the fire. The defendants were in receipt of the notice of cancelation when the fire occurred. The property was vacant and had been totally destroyed by fire. When the fire happened, the defendant insurance company, which had placed the policy on her premises, notified the plaintiff insurer of the impending foreclosure action. The insured suffered loss of $100,000. The mortgagee was in arrears at the time of the fire and had received notice that the policy was cancelled. The insurance company did not pay any of the $100k. The defence argued that the failure of the defendant to disclose this policy to the plaintiff's insurer raised the bar to a certain level of moral and ethical conduct. Dismissing the application, that the standard of proof in this case was on the balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged. The court found that the defendant breached its contractual obligation to insure the plaintiff against creditors. As a result of the foreclosure action, the insurer was forced to foreclose on the property. The Court also considered the individual circumstances of the plaintiff and found that since the policy had been placed with the plaintiff, she was not adversely affected by any misrepresentation on the part of the insurer."

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of that Code. The accused himself testified that he was in the driver's seat when he was found by the investigating officer to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine. He also testified that his attention was drawn to him when he got out of his vehicle and staggered slightly, then got back in. When read breath demand and caution, he told the officer he was too drunk to drive. He said he was not in care or control of the vehicle at the time. The defence argued that the risk assessment, as an element of care and controlling, should include an assessment of the risk of the accused changing his mind. HELD: The accused was not guilty of care or controlling of the motor vehicle. There were no adverse impacts on the public. The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation or conjecture to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80 might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk to the public in the event that such a possibility arises."
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was an an alcoholic. She included many allegations of improper conduct on the part of the father. The appellant appealed on the grounds that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for her child, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than a decision made on the written evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the investigation record was adduced into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and the psychologist's report was adadmissible, there was no case for even direction of the trial of issue, let alone an order in favour of the appellant.

The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in Bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcies.

He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

He submitted that the information could not be cured by severing count 4 of the impaired driving charge, failing to comply with breath demand, obstruction of a police officer and operating a motor vehicle while disqualified. He argued that the delay in moving the trial to April 9, 2009 was excessive and would result in the death of his or her parents. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The matter was remitted to the trial judge in order to be concluded. 1)No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial decision. No reasonable apprehension was made by virtue in the conduct of the judge. The trial judge did not fail to give sufficient notice to the appellant that he would have to file notice of motion returnable in the Court on Queen's and the trial court in order that the case be concluded. 2)The trial judge was rightly bound to consider the appellant’s application because he had learned of his previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count.

She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice.

The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and moved in with the mother. They lived together for several years. The mother was working full-time and the father lived in the home with the children. They moved in together in 2009. The oldest son, who was in the military, was in need of a parent's assistance. The two older children were in needof a parent. The father bounced from home to home. The boys did not bathe daily, sometimes only two times week. The only source of daily entertainment for the children was from the mother's mother. The parties' home was in considerable disrepair and there was mould on the walls. Damion and the younger son, Johnathan, were in the same grade as the boys and had a less active relationship. The parents no longer lived together. The son, a high school student, had a serious motor vehicle accident in November 2011 which left him hospitalized for several months. He required medical treatment, was given a month's pay and a lump sum payment of $8,041.86 was paid retroactive to December 2011. The family moved to live with the petitioner's sister, who assisted with the renovations. The petitioner was employed full- time and received extra income from her. She did not have a child tax credit or employment supplement. The children lived with her mother for several weeks. The husband was in a relationship with the boys but it was not an ideal arrangement. The wife was in debt to Revenue Canada and was unable to obtain one. The child's father was in receipt of child tax benefits from the province and the Court could not determine whether this was a proper arrangement for the parties' son. The Court could only conclude that the father had been negligent in failing to obtain the benefits he was entitled to and that his failure to obtain them was a factor. The court could not conclude that this was an appropriate arrangement for a son of the family."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","HELD: The application was granted. The respondent was ordered to pay child support based on an income of $150,000. The petitioner opposed the application to completely discontinue the child and spousal support obligation and further for all support arrears to be expunged. The court found the respondent had not proven that he could not pay support at the time of the application, and it was not necessary to rely on or wait for representations from the respondent. The Court found that the respondent elected not to challenge the imputed income made 10 years ago. The obligation does not lie on the petitioner to show why the imputing income is still appropriate. The only issue that the court asked to be determined was whether the respondent's ongoing obligation to pay was justified. HELD: 1) The respondent had failed in his onus for the years 2005 through to, and including, 2012. There will be no variation of the order for that time period. The issue here is whether the support obligation be varied to reflect a lower income than that imputed in the original order. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. The Respondent has failed in this onus. The parties have two children. The oldest child ceased to be a child of the marriage in December 2015 when she finished her post-secondary education. The youngest child is expected to finish her education in spring 2017. The father is to pay $350 per month. 2) The Court was required to determine whether the existing order was correct at the original time, and whether it should be varied retroactively to expunge the arrear. The nature of the maintenance order sought to be varied, and there should be a presumption that the original ordered was correct and the original imputation of income was correct. The fact that the father has been in arreary for the past 10 years does not prejudge the assessment of an appropriate historical income for the respondent, given that he has been earning consistent income for several years. The Onus is on the applicant to establish why the support should be continued, even if it is necessary to reduce the arreears. The burden of proof lies with the respondent and he must demonstrate that he is unlikely to be able to pay in the future. The evidence presented by the former partners and the father regarding the difficulty of reaching an agreement on an imputed amount of support does not support the determination of an adequate historical income.

At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

7_1998canlii13397.txt,"The petitioner sought retroactive child and spousal support of $47,367. No children were presently dependent upon her and she was self-sufficient. The parties married in 1963. The mother was a homemaker until 1983 when they bought and operated a small town hotel which ultimately failed in 1990. The petitioner alleged they separated in 1990 when the father left the province to seek work elsewhere. He sent no money for two years until 1992 when he sent $3,200 and bought a washer and dryer. She commenced a divorce action in 1996 which was adjourned sine die by consent. The marriage was dissolved in June 1998. The respondent did not keep records of money sent as he did not consider they had separated until 1993. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)Nothing turned on the actual date of separation which was difficult to determine. The mother was entitled to make a claim for support whenever she believed his contribution was inadequate, whether or not she perceived herself separated from him. 2)The primary purpose of a support order is not to compensate for past failure but to satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not address that purpose. She did not make a claim until 1996 and then did not prosecute her claim for another two years, at a time when neither she nor the children were dependent.","The mother sought retroactive child and spousal support. She claimed the husband did not pay sufficient support when both she and the children were dependent upon him. HELD: The application was dismissed. There would not be an order enforcing retroactive support. The primary purpose of a support order is not tocompensate for past failure but rather, satisfy present need. Making a retroactive order would not add to the purpose. The claim was dismissed with costs."

Appeal dismissed; the appellant had relied in its factum on the statutory conditions as basis for its claim; the trial judge found that the appellant did not commit a fraud in obtaining payment under the policy and the coverage under the insurance policy was vitiated pursuant to Statutory Condition 7.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for an order excluding new evidence from her evidence during a lunch break following the hearing of a voir dire and a day and one-half of evidence in the trial proper. The Crown had made late disclosure to the accused, denying her her right to make full answer and defence. The accused argued that the Crown's intention to adduce the evidence had adversely affected her ability to make 'full answer and defense' to the charges against her. She sought exclusion of evidence or a mistrial. Application allowed; trial ordered. Although the Crown had not explicitly agreed to admissibility of the new evidence, the complainant had made a significant agreement with the Crown that it would not be prejudicial to her to re-elect. The disclosure of new evidence can be used to impeach or contradict things she had told the Crown in her video taped statement. However, the breach by the Crown was not deliberate. The complainant had clearly made a choice to reelect. It was important to maintain the integrity of the evidence and to ensure its disclosure was made in a timely fashion. The trial should be fair and balanced against the interests of society. The 'truth seeking' function of the court would be compromised if the order excluding evidence did not go to voluntariness. The court is always reluctant to order a mistririal except in the clearest of cases and when the impugned conduct undermines trial fairness or the decision making process. There is a compelling authority that a mistry is the appropriate remedy for late disclosure which has affected an accused's pre-trial rights. There was a substantial breach of the accused's right to re elect a judge and jury at trial and a significant breach of her right not to call defence evidence at trial. The respondent made strategic decisions regarding her re-election, including agreeing not to contest the admissible of the video taped evidence if her motion to dismiss at the end of the Crown’s case were unsuccessful. She negotiated with the crown beforehand to avoid any embarrassment. The agreement was mutual and the parties agreed that the new information would not affect her re re- election. The Court was satisfied that the respondent had made significant strategic decisions to ensure her re‑election in the event that charges against the defendant were not dismissed. The decision was fair and balances the interests and interests of the society generally. A mistrial would result because the respondent was unable to re‑elect."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.

It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.",The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not validly exercise their right to first refusal. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 28(2)(b) of The Farm Land Security Act which states that a letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to a person is required in order for a lender to finance the purchase of the land. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1) The defendant's offer of first- refusal was not conditional or unequivocal. It was an unconditional and unequivocal commitment. 2) The loan approval issued by the defendant was not an unconditional or unequivococal commitment as the legislation was not complied with. 3) The plaintiff did not require delivery of these monies until May 30/97. 4) The court reviewed the applicable s. 25(2(b)(ii) ofthe Act and found that the plaintiffs had complied in all circumstances with respect to the offer of the defendant. The only exception was that the letter from the defendant's solicitors was the first time request was made for a letter addressed to them from the financial institution and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. The Court considered the following: 1) the letter was conditional (1) that it required a letter from a recognised financial institution as the purchaser in each case; 2) that the loan approval was not a conditional and unequivoc commitment from recognized financial institutions to finance such a purchase.

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.

The respondent now sought equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. The Matrimonial Property Act, 1992 applies. The children have had the benefit of one constant, outside the home, sitter for the past 16 months. The Court reviewed the access provisions submitted for consideration at hearing by the respondent.

The parties have two children born in 1994 and a son in 1993. The current joint custody arrangements are not working well for the children. 2)The children have been enjoying the benefits of a shared day-care with their father. However, they are also enjoying the benefit from a shared bed with their mother. The visits in paragraphs 2 and 3 are reference to the Corollary Relief order and are reference material for the Corrilary Relief Order. 3)The Court reviewed all the evidence concerning the children and their relationship with their Father. The evidence did not reveal any pressing or immediate differences of philosophy or opinion between the parties. Both were supportive of French emersion. Both expressed strong religious preferences and concerns. Both children were respectful of their father's presence. The father was more flexible and accommodating. The Corollaries Relief order was to reflect the parties' agreement for each parent to hold in trust and administer one-half the children's investments and reminded them that this is the childrens money and they are responsible and accountable to the children for the monies.

Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way.

The plaintiff suffered a mild case of impalement, but no injuries. The medical evidence did not support the plaintiff's claim for damages. The negligence was not the result of the defendants' inadequate care. The Court accepted the plaintiff as having suffered a severe case of soft tissue loss, but found that the defendants and their doctors did not fall below the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff.

The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired driving. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial in finding the appellant had the care or control of a motor Vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The inference made by the trial judge was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with. The Crown argued that the inference made was one the judge could have reached at the facts and therefore must not be rebutted. The appellant failed to rebut the same evidence that he was in care or controlling of the motor vehicle at the time. The evidence consisted of the testimony of his three friends whose evidence related to the appellant having abstained from consuming alcoholic beverages in their presence and not to whether he had care and control of his vehicle during time frame No. 1. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The Appeal Court found that the trial judges findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and care and controlling and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he Was in the Driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly the appellant was in the care and custody of the vehicle at time frame 1. The Court found no palpable or overriding error in her assessment of the evidence, her interpretation of the law, her application of the facts to the evidence and her application to the law."

Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The sole beneficiary was the estate. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for the elder son until he attains the age of twenty-one years. The codicillium was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the child's maintenance until he reaches the ageof twenty-five years. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the estate to be paid out of the Estate. 1)The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and, whereas in Thauberger (supra) the interest income exceeded the level of support claimed, here it was unknown what income the Estate would generate. 2)The petitioner was awarded child support of $150 per month. The amount to be awarded for maintenance was not tied to the standard of living the children experienced during the testator's lifetime, or to the net incomes the children would generate subsequently. The children were entitled to some additional income from farming activities."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against their clients. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an Aboriginal rights defence. Commercial fishing was not an issue in this case. The accused was found not guilty on all the counts."

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3. The court compared the offer to my decision and found that the petitioner's decision ended up being considerably more favourable to the petitioner than what the respondent offered to settle for. The purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court is obvious. The issues that were litigated were substantial and merited a trial. However, nonetheless the fact remains that an offer to settle was tendered which was not found and the trial proceeded. Again all of this would have been avoided had the offer been accepted."

The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent had been found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division had set aside the injunction and the respondent's counsel had proceeded with the disciplinary hearing on the basis of apprehension of bias on behalf of the I.D.A. and the disciplinary committee. The applicant argued that the trial judge's decision was premature and premature. Application for interim injunction dismissed.

4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with possession for the use of property obtained by crime under s355(b) of The Criminal Code. The knapsack had been found in an open motor vehicle in an area of the wharf and was found to contain items of such a personal nature. The cocaine was found in the knapsock and because no one else had access to the knapack, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented to their being there. The evidence established that the accused had cocaine in the vehicle and knapsacks stuffed with cocaine and marijuana. The accused was not present on the whiff at the time of the investigation. The police officers seized a backpack containing several large amounts of cash, a knapsak and a large amount of cash which they used to package cocaine. At the police station they found an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, a digital scale and three rolls of cash containing $1000. The Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the possession of the accused. HELD: The accused is guilty of all three charges before the Court.  1) The evidence was admissible against the accused knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. 2) The Court found no need to refer to circumstantials evidence. The direct evidence of the Crown was that the cash was found at the hands of the officer when he entered the vehicle. The identification papers, licenses and personal papers were found in his backpack. The small lock on the front of the backpack was not secured by a lock. 3) The accused admitted that he gave the knappedapsack to the accused and that he put it at his feet in the back of the car. The Court was satisfied that the knapping and the knuckles were of a personal type and that the defendant had consented in letting them be there. 4) The Crown established that these items were for the lawful purpose of transporting and that they had a measure of control over them."
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.",The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The Agency had previously assessed the children as having mild to moderate to severe head lice, but suspected that because the parents had not been caring for the children properly, the children had been subject to a substantial risk of head lices, which they considered a substantial danger to their health. The children had lived with the Agency for approximately 5 years and had been out of the mother's care for approximately 9 months. The mother had recently had a baby girl, S.D., born in 2001 and although the children did not show any improvement in their early years, they were doing well on the assessments. The agency had made a referral to Children's Aid for a Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test, which was completed in September 2001. The child had been in temporary care with the mother until December 2001, when the Agency staff, Family Skills and the Children's Services Services terminated their services. The parents then applied for a Disposition Hearing, which resulted in the granting of a conditional order for the Agency to continue its assessment of the children and to provide services to the mother. The applicant successfully applied for this Disposition hearing and the matter was adjourned for a hearing. The evidence was that the mother had been verbally abusive to the children, had been physically abusive to them, had had some physical injuries and had suffered a beating when the children were younger and had expressed some concern about her relationship with her new boyfriend. The application was dismissed. The Court found that the parents were in a reasonable position to cooperate with the completion of the Child Stress Assessment and that the Agency had not proven that the parent should parent. The family was in good physical health and appeared to be able to handle the increased number of visits and the increased risk of exposure to head laces. The assessment of S.M. was not completed until May 2002 and the children continued to be in the mother’s care.

HELD: The application was dismissed with the exception of the alternative variation in the access she had to Jacob. 1)It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The foregoing case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk to a child exists), but proceed to a final order. 2)The applicant was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs in Saskatchewan. The child lived with the wife. She worked part time and was with the husband. She lived with him every afternoon. She travelled extensively around the world. She often had to stay in the home with the child and was in the hospital with the respondent. She did not have any legal advice with respect to her rights. Custody may very well remain with the Wife in the long term. Until that final decision is made, an unwarranted change for the children is not in their best interests.

Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The wife was in the military, earning between $51,000 and $60,000 a year. She was working and living with her father. The father was in support of his son, aged 16. The wife was now in receipt of income from her pension, which was just over $58,000. The applicant's income was primarily derived from his pension. She had recently been hospitalized and he was seeking maintenance. The corollary relief judgment, which provided for maintenance of $400 per month for five years, was varied in June 2005 to reflect a change in circumstances. The application was heard in June 2006 and the court found that there had been a change of circumstances as required by the Divorce Act. The reason for the variation was that the wife's income had increased since the divorce and she had been unable to take one university course which resulted in her hospitalization. The court sympathetic to the wife’s need for support and to the applicant’S need to see an end to this obligation. Although there was no cure for the wife, she had a home and could take in boarders. The son’d been living with the father for the past few years and he had recently taken a job as a nurse. The husband was in receipt $400 a month for the first two months, payable in bi-monthly installments of $300. The oldest son was in high school and the mother was working. The two were enjoying successful careers and the son was an important student. The mother’ s need for spousal support was met by the father’ve continued decline in his income. The family was enjoying a reasonably stable income and the applicant was able to take care of the son. The only issue left for the husband was the length of support which could be terminated based on the wife having continued to require support. The length of time to terminate spousals was at the higher end given the age difference between the parties and the disability. The respondent was now retired and could no longer work. The daughter was spending much less time with her mother. The parents were enjoying a fairly normal life and the father was working, but the wife was experiencing some health problems and the length was at a higher end due to her age. The child’ll need constant support from the father."

The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 344 and 388 directing the manner in which monies paid into court pursuant to garnishee summonses and other monies should be distributed between the parties. He requested two 1999 orders be amended to the extent necessary to give the relief requested. The brothers had been involved in a dispute over the division of farming assets since July 1999. A third party commenced legal action in QB No.3510/99 against the brothers and garnisheed revenues from the Pregnant Mare Urine operation for approximately 1 year. The brother's application for an injunction to permit him to take over the operation was dismissed in the January 12, 2001 fiat.

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs applied for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes: Veterans Resident Class; Dependent Resident Class and Dependant Non-Resident Class; The plaintiffs claim entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' pursuant to legislation enacted July 31, 2000. The claim is based on claims of breach of fiduciary duty and trust by the defendant Crown collecting CPP contributions from all working Canadians regardless of their sexual orientation but until July 31/2000, it was not given a hearing. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of a limitation defence. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the class members.

d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the youth justice court for review under s. 103 of the YCJA. The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCPJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had already elapsed. The Crown appeals its decision and argues that the provincial director's power to'suspend' community supervision under s102(2) is flawed. Section 102(2)(a) includes the word 'apprehension' after the reference to s107 merely as an aid to the reader. There is no reference to suspension in s102. The youth justice system is designed to promote rehabilitation and reintegration. The YCP does not provide a complete set of conditions for the respondent to escape custody. The only thing that it does provide is an order for the youth to remain in custody until a review is conducted by the Youth Court. The application of s102 (apprehensions) and 108 (following the arrest of such a young person) is not an issue. The proper Interpretation of the Act is that s.107(1) is the reference s.102(1)(b) of the Youth Code. It states that if a youth is apprehended, the young person is deemed not to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the young people is then serving, then remanded to any youth custody facility that the youth is deemed appropriate until review is held. The Court of Appeal does not refer to s102 as an application under s103. The meaning of the word “order” in the YCCJA is expressed in the meaning of rehabilitation and is expressed through the meaning and purpose of the provision in s2. The essence of the meaning behind the word order is expressed by the YP. The purpose of s103 is to promote and re-integration and the meaning in the words of the declaration of principles in s. 102(1). The Youth Justice Court judge focused unduly on the provincial Director’s lack of authority to “suspend�"
2_2007skqb99.txt,"This judgment dealt with divorce and division of family property. At issue was the value of the matrimonial home and the balance of family property. HELD: Decree of divorce issued. Valuations of the family home and property were made, and exemptions and equitable considerations were addressed. Equalization payments were prescribed. As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were married in 1998 and moved in together in 1999. They lived in the family home that is currently a Grade 12 residence. Upon the birth of their first child, they moved in with the children. They later moved out on their own. Upon their divorce, the mother moved in alone with the child. She later became pregnant and moved back in with them. The family home was divided between them. In 1999, the father began working as a sawmill worker and then moved into a vacant house on a farm. The principle asset is the family farm that is presently a Grade 13 residence. The son now lives in the home with the mother. In 2000, the wife began cosmetology courses. They resided in the house until the middle of 2001. Upon completion of the course of the spousal relationship, the son began cosmetic studies. He began working at Weyerhaeuser in 2001. He then took a job as municipal labourer. In 2002, he began working for the sawmill. He moved back into the family when the children began attending cosmetological courses. The wife then began working part-time as a result of the marriage. She eventually moved back to the farm. She now lived in a modest home. The husband now begins working part time as a municipal labourers. He begins selling his business. The parties are in agreement that other family property be divided equally. However, there is a dispute as to the amount of the proceeds that can be paid to the wife. The Court will not order the sale of the entire family home as it was at the time of the application. The issue is what is the Family Property Act and how it should be distributed. HELD: The Family Property Law Act, s. 21(1) requires that the matrimonial property or its value, both as defined in s. 2, be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions, and equitable considerations mentioned in the statute. The Act does not require an adjustment for the value of the 1.38 acres. The balance of family property is $94,621.77. The purpose of this application is to determine the appropriate distribution of family assets. The evidence is accepted as of the date of application. 1) The Court fixed July 2005 (application date) for the valuation of the family property. The date of adjudication is to be determined. 2) The evidence set out in Crowe v. Metz (1991) indicates generally preference for using the date. The Courts have"

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. The respondent's counsel has put before the court another salve in the ongoing custody andaccess dispute. HELD: The respondent has ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and render my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before them. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. The petitioner shall have costs of $500 in respect to the notice of objection payable within 15 days. 1) The respondent is not entitled to waive his solicitor's custody privilege. It is irrelevant that the solicitor's proposal is identical to the solicitor’s proposal in that it is unreasonably late and for no good reason. It was a proposal that was accepted by the court. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a waiver. As the settlement communications were almost always relevant to the issue that are proper considered by Court, and it is rarely that there is any competing proposal or, if, anyreason to reference it at all, costs can be pursued with vigour after trial if either of the parties is of such mind. 2) The solicitor exhibited an identical letter to his counsel that was clearly from his counsel to the petitioner. It read: 'Without Prejudice'. This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote. Relevance of settlement proposals: Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when a party seeks to establish a concluded agreement, it happens too often and for good reason, and the respondent exhibited an affidavit that was marked “Without Prejuice.” 3) The letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court in an issue, it happened too often, for no reason, to the respondent. It does not diminish the relevance of the proposal. It merely puts the matter on the basis of a comprehensive proposal. The solicitor was not asked to waive the privilege. He was merely responding to a request by the petitioner to make a proposal to the court that he could not refuse. He did not indicate that he thought the proposal was relevant to his position at the time"

Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents.

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

There was also a Charter violation of her rights to be tried in a fair manner. 2) There was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments from May 2004 to November 2004 to seek counsel and to obtain and to disclose the information. 3) The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007. 4) The total delay is twelve months. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set. 5) The trial judge found there was no prejudice to the complainant as she suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. She was diligent in preparing the charges. The court found there is no waiver from the previous delay of approximately 3.5 months.  6) The length of delay from the date of charge to the dateof trial is approximately thirty-one months. Fairness to the victim requires that even for offences such as these that trials be held within reasonable period of time so that the accused does not suffer undue prejudice and so that she can fairly defend herself and so society's interest in having these matters heard can also be done within reasonable time, including within reasonable periods of time."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July 1999. The defendant admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff's crop on one occasion but said that there was no evidence that his cows were in it on any other occasion. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiffs. The cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The court found that the cattle were not in the field on more than one occasion and that other cattle were also not in that field. The plaintiff's cattle were found to have caused the entire crop loss. The Court also found that although the plaintiff had attempted to combine most of the field, there was minimal damage to the crop, the plaintiff was still entitled to account for the damages to the plaintiff.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter.

Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.

It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt filed for a conditional order of discharge under Queen's Bench Rule 319. He argued that s. 241 of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. The bankrupt's former business, which was his sole shareholder, was a successful venture. He also argued that the failure of his former venture, Red Bull Enterprises Ltd., was a personal failure which was caused by a protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of his company to occupy land owned by the Department. The applicant's proposed business plan was a modest one, with a reasonable source of income for a family of four. The assignment occurred in December 1995 and the bankrupt has been in bankruptcy for 28 months.

Income was imputed to the respondent by the court. The amount involved was within the $40,001 range. The parenting arrangement for the parties' two children was the subject of much debate and the court imputed an income level to the applicant that was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). Costs of $3000 are assessed against the respondent. The parties litigated the appellment of child and access right and the quantitative quantification for child support. The issues were complex and the need for the court to exercise its discretion and to move away from strict application of the Tariffs was often present. The decision on costs was difficult given the often mixed outcome and the impact of an onerous costs award on families and children in particular. The need for court to keep its discretion in the hands of the parties and to look beyond the tariff to the best interests of the children and to reduce the litigant's tax bill."

The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","A horrible event took place which resulted in serious injury to a member of this community. Several individuals told the police that the accused youth is responsible for those injuries. The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the accused at the time of her arrest to ensure her attendance in court, or to prevent further offences on her part. The Youth Criminal Justice Act is amended to provide for a detention of a youth who is a young person within the meaning of the Youth Criminal justice Act.

However, the public in La Ronge and area is so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public.

The corporations have been very profitable and the retained earnings of both companies far exceed the amount of long term debt. HELD: 1) The respondent has deemed additional income of $50,000 and $27,200 from the two companies. 2) The imputed annual income of the respondent is $150,000. 3) Costs in the amount of $750 to the petitioner.","The issue between the parties was the amount of child maintenance payable by the respondent to the petitioner for the benefit of Brady Melvin, born January 9, 1993.

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Land Contracts (Actions) Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with Queen's Bench Rule 318 and 319.

The application is premature. The applicant is prepared to make an offer but does not appear to have done so. The order nisisi for sale is for sale, and will be in compliance of Rule 318/319. The affidavit filed by the listing agent who was charged with the listing of the property was incorrect. The amount shown to be owing by the defendants on the application for the appointment to hear an application for leave in a hearing was incorrect as the amount includes items in addition to the principal outstanding and the interest arrears. The address of the mortgage on the property does not refer to a home. The home is in good standing with the Court of Appeal and the Act provides for clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.",The defendant brought two separate notices of motion. The first was for the plaintiff to examine her affidavit on her affidavit. The second was for her to appear on her oral evidence. The court was not prepared to make the order requested by the plaintiff but wanted her to testify on her own affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. The purpose of the affidavit was to give the defendant an opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs. The plaintiff did not seek to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor did it seek to have the court direct the defendant to change any portion of the material. The notice of motion was granted to the defendant. The wording of s. 12 of The Class Actions Act is novel. It is pertinent to note that the wording of the Act is not determinative for the purposes of the present motion.
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench. In May 2008, the Court issued a judgment in relation to a petition by the respondent for division of matrimonial property and spousals maintenance. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage. The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. The respondents had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. The appellant was 60. The mother was working and living in Hawaii. She had recently had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and was now living with the appellant. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The evidence before the Court was insufficient to establish that the respondent was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish this fact until just before the hearing of her application. It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish she was unable, unable to becoming self sufficient and on her review application she showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the Court and prior to the filing of the notice of motion and to the hearing in the application. 2) The Court found that the chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage, although she was no longer on medication. She testified that she was not capable of full time employment since losing the Westfair Foods position but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate she was incapable of work and did not, in fact, say she was Unable to work. In fact, she indicated that she indicated she was seeking full time position. 3) The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent, on the basis that she is over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. The factors to be considered when determining retroactive support are Rimmer v. Adshead 2004 SKQB 536 (2005) 259 Sask. R. 161 per Dawson J. at paragraph 67. It is clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self- sufficient. It has established that the proper income for the appellant, who was 60, is still in the neighbourhood of $30,000.

c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic public school program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church (the ""Church"") or other entity of the same name. It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these six school building. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the CapeBreton Board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these buildings from the Church. The board submitted there was an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver the basic Public School Program, to lease buildings from a third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. The Cape Bretons' request is based on the submission that the province is statutorily mandated to provide free of cost the buildings required to deliver these buildings. The Province is not required to pay the cost of these leases."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support paid for his 2 daughters by one-half. An earlier corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. The father was ordered to file a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing income received from his employment in the past few years and to pay child support of $300 per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are less than $2,200.00 and when the father earns $2200.50 per month or more he shall pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to the on-going child support obligation. 1)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been amaterial change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate. 2)The father was to pay $300.00 per child per child for months when he was earning $2.200 or greater and $150.00 for child support when hisgross monthly earnings were less than$2,400.00.  3)The Court ordered that the respondent file a statement or a cheque in respect to income received by his employment with the maintenance enforcement office commencing September 30, 1996 and every three month period until the arreariars are paid in full."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applied for an amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be increased on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It was clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant’s entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The judgment in that particular requires amendment since there was no evidence before the court at trial regarding substantive offers made by the parties prior to trial. It is also not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. 2)Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. The jurisprudence is clear that an inherent power to vary its own order so as not to offend the court’S censure does not allow appeal to the Court of Appeal on an order as to costs. Rule 542 provides that the costs of all proceedings in the court are in the discretion of the court. This discretion is virtually unfettered but must be exercised judicially on the facts of the case. 3)The applicant made an offer well before the application went to trial and the offer remained open until judgment was given. The respondent was awaiting the outcome of this application in order to satisfy the judgment in this respect."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The respondent's ex-wife had not signed the agreement on the value as it was not made out in writing. 2)The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that settlement should not be enforced if it wasobviously incomplete. 3)The judge declared that the pre- trial had terminated and made orders with respect to values of certain other items of property. The fiat contained the direction: If the petitioner is not going to accept the value and the employer contributions of $40,576, if they're not accepting the combined values of these figures as being the value the respondent pension you are to have prior to the pre trial date an actuaries valuation of the pension."

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

The applicants appear to have argued a determinationof question of Law, but the respondent has argued forum non conveniens. The Court reviewed the applicants' briefs and concluded that that was the question the applicants had raised. The court then amended the application to include an additional claim for costs. The notice of application was amended to include a claim for additional claim.

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s4877.051(3) of sCriminal Code.

His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revved. At the time his driver's licence was revoked he was guilty of the offence. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATIV on the road.

c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on dangerous driving. The defence argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the accused was following the complainant and that the complainant was not very friendly towards her and was very agitated. The complainant was unable to exit because the accused stopped beside her. The appellant appealed his dangerous driving conviction. Appeal allowed; conviction upheld. The trial judge's decision to sentence the accused to 18 months probation was a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent driver in similar circumstances. The court found that the judge failed not to take the respondent's position that all elements of an assault offence under s. 266 of the Criminal Code had been made out by the appellant. The Court also found that her testimony was supported by the evidence. The respondent's argument before the trial court was limited to the application of the de minimis non curat lex principle because, he argued, the grabbing or touching was minimal and therefore not worthy of criminal sanction. The offence was only made out if the accused consented to the use of force. The evidence showed that the appellant was driving in the other lane, parallel to the complainant, and that, apart from the two parked cars, no other vehicles, pedestrians or children were present at the time of the incident. The location of where the incident occurred elevates the dangerous nature of the appellant's actions. The fact that he drove parallel to her, while not properly convicted, could have presented danger for oncoming vehicles or pedestrians. The facts showed that neither was physically injured."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their four siblings. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend was not extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court granted provisional permission in August 2013 to the Lawlessness children to attend the school. The family applied to strike the statement of claim as an abuse of process. HELD: The Court found that the Lawlers had failed to live up to their ten commitments as a parent and family. The CÉF has failed to provide an educational environment free from discrimination, harassment and discrimination. The Family has failed, and continues to fail, to provide a French first language school.  1) The Court rejected the Lawler's application for an interlocutory injunction as an attempt to undermine their ten year tradition of attending a French school. 2) The Family was not consulted with the Court about the application for a declaration that the CÉFS discriminated against the Lawrays because of their disability. The Act distinguishes between 'conseil scolaire fransaskois' and 'conceil ecole fransaska'. The parties consistently referred to the CéF as the 'CÉF'. The CéLeste is a conseil Scolaire created by s. 42.1 of The Education Act to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransascolas in Saskatchewan. The Education act distinguishes between a 'conselil scule fransaspois' (CSF) and 'counsel' (conseile ecole). The parties clearly stated that the CSF's ostensible concern about the Lawling family's failure to liveup to their commitments was not the real reason for its decision to not renew their provisional permission. The CSF has demonstrated that it has a duty to provide quality educational instruction in a French First Language School to its children. The principles and goals of the CCEF are met in accordance with their respective constitutions. The court awarded the Lawlings special damages for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the costs of preparing the materials for the materials and preparing the necessary support to the end of the school year for their continued education.

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The Applicant applied for final approval in 2000 and then in 1998 for a tentative subdivision bylaw. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be incapable of meeting the higher road standard. The developer appealed the decision of the development officer declaring the application to be incomplete. Appeal set aside; although the municipality relied on s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher standard was applicable to this Application, the municipality also relied upon s.278 of the MGI Act in finding the application was incomplete. This decision is of significant importance to the applicant because it means a much more expensive road construction process. The application is incomplete and could only be granted granted if the applicant makes a grandparenting application. The requirements for mandamus are exacting. The Planning Officer had a different interpretation of mandamus."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would pay the plaintiff a deposit and service fee in order to reduce its energy bill. The plaintiff paid the defendant the sum of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000) and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months. The action in Nova Scotia was commenced in December 1994. The defendants then applied to set aside the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The parties in the action did not file a defence until after the time limit for making an appearance had expired. The default judgment was set aside and the defendant applied to vary the order to include a condition that the plaintiff pay half of the sum which was set against him. Dismissing the application, that the defendant had not made a reasonable excuse for its delay and that the reasons given by the appellant were not triable or convincing."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent for the sum of $113,155.19 less the sum $15,580.00 being the value of the matrimonial property. The access issue was further complicated by the death of the respondent's father who died with the result that the issues were further complicated.HELD: The respondent's net matrimony property was reduced by the addition of the capital cost allowance. The respondent was awarded a judgment against him for the amount of $115,155.,19 less $15/580. The court found that the average capital cost on land and buildings should not be added back for purposes of determining the respondent income and for the purpose of the Guidelines. The judgment was a charge on the respondent\'s personal land."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. HELD: 1) The pleadings do not support a claim for damages for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. 2) The defendant is under a positive fiduciari duty to protect the plaintiff from injury to his person, physical or mental health or morals and the defendant knew or ought to have known that the plaintiff would suffer damages if the defendant failed to carry out its duty. However, as the defendant was in charge of the residential school at the time, the legislation governs its operation and maintenance. This arrangement is within the knowledge and peruse of the defendant and, as such, the plaintiff is not obliged to provide further particulars. 3) The evidence from the authorities in the province and beyond supports the conclusion that the pleadings are not credible representations of the statutory duties conferred by the legislation. The evidence does not support the claim for punitive damages. 4) The plaintiff relies on Odger's Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions in the High Court of Justice. The latter was used extensively in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada denying the application for leave to appeal the decisions of F.P. v. Saskatchewan (2004), 249 Sask. R. 42 (Sask. C.A.) (leave to appeal dismissed) and Koop v. Carey (2004) (leave TO appeal dismissed). 5) The Government relies on R.E.L. v.(2000 SKQB 74) where the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation' were struck. However the plaintiff cites cases involving the same open ended phrase and subjects that such phrase is common. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to defend the claim. The defendant knew and ought to be aware of the probable consequences of its actions and the damages such actions would cause to the plaintiff. The administration is entitled, once the claim is proven, to strike the offending portions of the statement of claim. 6) The claim for special damages is set aside pending the outcome of the trial."
