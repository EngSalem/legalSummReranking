Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: JONES, J.A. (orally)","The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls.
He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence.
Dismissing the appeal,
that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","[0, 38, 37, 41, 2, 4, 40, 34, 3, 8, 36, 6, 31]"
2,"[1] W.R.T. Equipment Ltd. (“W.R.T.” or the “Company”) applies for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the “W.R.T. Proposal” or “Proposal”) pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “BIA”).
[2] Section 59 of the BIA governs applications for approval of an insolvent person’s Proposal under the BIA and it provides as follows:
(1) The court shall, before approving the proposal, hear report of the trustee in the prescribed form respecting the terms thereof and the conduct of the debtor, and, in addition, shall hear the trustee, the debtor, the person making the proposal, any opposing, objecting or dissenting creditor and such further evidence as the court may require.
[3] Mr. Jeffrey Pinder, chartered insolvency and restructuring practitioner and principal of the firm, Jeffrey Pinder Associates Inc., trustee licensed in bankruptcy pursuant to the BIA has been appointed by the Company to act as trustee of its Proposal (the “Trustee”).
Since filing the Proposal with the Official Receiver for the Saskatoon Bankruptcy District on November 12, 2002, two meetings of the creditors were held on December 3, 2002 and December 17, 2002.
At the December meeting approximately 93 percent of W.R.T.’s creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the Proposal.","The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide.
He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status.
HELD: The Proposal was accepted.
 1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA.
The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims.
Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal.
2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court.
The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation.
Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.
 3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","[1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5]"

4,"[1] The issue is whether the pro rata distribution of purchase money proceeds and non‑purchase money proceeds in any deficiency judgment pursuant to judicial sale extends to the total outstanding amount of the mortgage.
Partridge had originally executed mortgage for $191,000, of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium unit and $15,000 was advanced for other purchases.
Thus, the non‑purchase money portion of the loan advanced and secured by the mortgage was 8% of the total mortgage.
This sum is referred to as the “net sale proceeds” to be distributed pro rata as directed by Walker at paragraph 35.
[5] As at November 1, 2017, the amount of principal and interest owing on the non‑purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,256.86.
I find that RBC is entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.
RBC should not have the solicitor‑client costs prorated in accordance with the non‑purchase money portion of the mortgage.

The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale.
The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata.

The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment.
It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage.
The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.

5,"Mr. Stonechild was in extremely poor physical condition and blind in one eye.
[7] What transpired next between Constable Power and Mr. Stonechild was captured on video by the BDU security camera.
The video shows that after Constable Power arrived in his police vehicle, he exited from the driver’s door.
If so, this was in error as the extent of Mr. Stonechild’s injuries does not indicate whether more force than necessary was used (R Piapot at para 45).
SCR 347). Moreover, even under his own analysis, the trial judge failed to consider the very relevant circumstance of Mr. Stonechild’s medical status as HIV and Hepatitis positive in his assessment of the potential for harm to be done by the assault.
[96] Ultimately, as the appeal court judge observed, because the trial judge erred in his approach in these ways, the trial judge failed to see the push-kick as an objectively reasonable and proportionate response in all of the circumstances of this matter.
In short, Constable Power had to react almost instantly to the threat he felt Mr. Stonechild posed to his person—there can be no question of the constable’s subjective belief in this regard.
Given this, an acquittal ought to be entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge.
The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable.
The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief.
The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do.
The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal.
The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety.
He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole.
The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal.
The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred.
The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force.
The respondent had to react quickly.
The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","[585, 9, 31, 582, 594, 588, 32, 571]"

Appearing: Ms. Rock For the Crown
Mr. Roe For the Accused
JUDGMENT B.M. SINGER,
[3] The police got involved with the Accused as result of complaint of Ms. Anna Krakowetz.
She then went outside and the vehicle left, again she only saw the back of the driver’s head and assumed, but could not be sure, it was the Accused.
Conversely the Court went on to say, “... deliberate and egregious police conduct that severely impacted the Accused’s protected interests may result in exclusion, notwithstanding that the evidence may be reliable.”
[35] I have determined in this case that the breaches were numerous and point to ignorance on the part of the police as to the distinction between their powers upon arrest and their powers upon investigative detention.
The police were mistaken and as result wilfully set out to ignore the Accused’s rights.
The search and seizure of the keys and fob had impact on the case.
They were used to identify the Accused’s vehicle and the Accused as possible driver of that vehicle.
I therefore exclude the evidence of the fob and keys.
[37] As a result the Accused is found not guilty of both charges before me.","The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers.
The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm.
The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving.
HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges.
The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous.
The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","[146, 141, 143, 142, 4, 19, 5, 12, 136, 137, 140, 3, 0]"

The Crown adduced evidence before Judge Clyde F. MacDonald in Provincial Court of breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams.
In addition to the evidence of the appellant an expert employed by the R.C.M. Police was called by the appellant to show what effect the alcohol consumed by the appellant would have on the appellant's ability to drive when stopped by the police.

8,"[1] The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired.
This issue and the interpretations in question have not previously been considered by this court.
[3] In 1981 Kenneth Roebuck mortgaged the subject land to the respondent to secure the repayment of then $36,000 debt.
It set out repayment schedule for the payment of this balance.
It does not limit the limitation period the respondent would otherwise have had available to commence his foreclosure action.
Indeed, since the applicable limitation period would have expired on March 1, 2006, but for the filing of the respondent`s notice of intention, the respondent effectively extended his limitation period to March 1, 2009.
But, mortgagees wishing to keep the limitation period stopped must act within the specified periods.
If they let the three-year period expire without making an application, the notice of intention and the resulting stopping of the limitation period clock both expire.
Conclusion [35] Having concluded that the limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent`s mortgage has expired, it follows, for the reasons outlined in para. 13 above that the registration of the mortgage must be ordered discharged as requested.
(1) The Registrar be directed to discharge Interest Register No. 106597705 from title to the property legally described as follows:
Extension As described on Certificate of Title 77B11021; and","Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action.
If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again.
The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again.
The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","[130, 123, 1, 118, 5, 9, 4, 119, 127, 122, 126]"

The accused corporation assembles log home packages.
The packages are sold to customers across Canada.
The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages.
L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused.
These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences.
In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused.
The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold.
The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence.
The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence.
HELD: 1)
The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'.
Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation.
See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371.
2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market.
Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.
 3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition.
Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4)
The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry.
The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands.
The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence.

This is a Chambers Application wherein the Applicant seeks approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff in this matter.
brief summary of the facts as supplied by counsel reveal as follows:
As said the Court has an obligation dealing with Contingency Fee Agreements to ensure the Rule is adhered to.
As it turns out, upon review, the Court found that there is no record of the Contingency Fee Agreement ever being filed with the Prothonotary within the required ten days or at all.
The wording in Civil Procedure 63.19(1) requires that the filing of the Agreement with the Prothonotary is mandatory because of the use of the word ""shall"".
This was not done in this case.
am prepared to receive and review properly prepared account as provided for in the Rules.
hasten to point out the Court is not prepared to allow the Taxing Master's account of $50.00 in any event.
As this was not done, the Court is not prepared to allow any fee payable to the Taxing Master.","The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement reached on behalf of the infant plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident.
Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant.
The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary.
Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement,
that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary.
As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.","[2, 3, 53, 56, 0, 1, 52, 45, 48, 47, 5, 7, 44]"

[2] On May 12, 2011, the Sheas filed Notice of Application in Chambers.
Ultimately, they agreed to have the matters heard on August 23 and 25, 2011.
As in many other cases, the dispute in this case concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation.
find that this Chambers application was determinative of the entire matter at issue in the proceeding, and consequently it is appropriate for me to consider multiplier of the maximum amounts in the range of costs set out in Tariff “C”.
[22] In this case, the application consumed one full day on October 18 and effectively the morning of October 20, 2011 by ending at 10:45 a.m.
conclude that effectively the hearing consumed days.
Therefore find $3000 is the appropriate base amount.

They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim.
Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two.
This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing.
While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs.
The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","[67, 3, 62, 1, 61, 60, 10, 4, 59, 51]"

[3] In the conduct of the investigation, Mr. Stratton arranged to have statements taken from former residents of the institutions.

The information available by this process should be disclosed to Keating.
That is, Keating is to be informed of the times and date of the allegations referred to in (2).
3) the evidence collected in relation to investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations;
These documents are not of factual nature.
5) information on any action taken as result of the review officers' recommendations;
Review officers' recommendations were merely opinions and should not be released.
6) the number and dollar amount of payouts made with respect to allegations against Mr. Keating;
10. The vast majority of claims are made against more than one employee and, consequently, the award, if any was made, was global in nature.
As result, there is no database that can produce record showing the amount of compensation tied to the allegations made against specific employee.
This request is not sufficiently clear and need not be addressed.
[64] Finally, this is an application for information and not for specific documents.","The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment.
He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations.
The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed.
Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven.
The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo.
The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes.
The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant.
Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province.
There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.
The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","[627, 7, 606, 0, 625, 601, 21, 3, 618, 620, 607, 612, 610, 613, 24, 614]"
13,"[1] The plaintiff, the landlord, claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking.
The tenant also claims damages for economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant.
[2] Six witnesses testified for the landlord which owns and leases the building to the tenant.
Mr. Phan, one of the principals of the plaintiff corporation, testified the floor was always clean and described daily floor maintenance of sweeping and mopping, and annual stripping, waxing and polishing.
Mr. Phan spoke to one or more of the three principals of the defendant corporation, inviting them to observe the stripping, waxing and polishing of the floor but, instead, the tenant expressed its intention to hire floor cleaner to do such work.
The tenant’s liability is therefore ameliorated by the remaining life of the floor (three years) at the end of the renewed lease.
[20] The tenant shall have costs for this three day trial of $2,500 inclusive of disbursements, in lieu of taxable costs.
The tenant may set off this judgment against the base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease.","HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof.
The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor.
The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years.
As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years.
The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed.
The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.
Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836.
The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","[132, 130, 0, 3, 4, 8, 10, 123]"

Cameron J.A.
[1] The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen’s Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court.
[2] The appellant was represented at trial by experienced counsel, but took the appeals himself.
[4] The appellant had little to say of this in the Court of Queen’s Bench beyond saying he had asked his counsel to adduce evidence of this nature at trial but that counsel had refused to do so.
Indeed, he informed the Court that, while he had evidence to prove his estranged wife’s perjury, it was not his intention to place that evidence before the Court.
He seemed to think all he had to do was raise the matter, by way of argument, to warrant new trial.
[6] In the circumstances, we are all of the view that there is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering new trial.
We might add that, on the facts as found by the trial judge, based on the judge’s assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code.
[7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied.
The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","[0, 3, 19, 20, 8, 18, 14, 4, 13, 11]"
15,"The grounds of appeal listed in the notice of appeal are as follows:
[2] The respondent, Robert Wesley Devlin Hancock (hereafter “Hancock”), purchased house having the civic address 515 Avenue North, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, from the appellants James Glen Richardson and Stephanie Erin Richardson (hereafter “the Richardsons”), pursuant to Residential Contract of Purchase and Sale (“the contract”) dated July 4, 2007.
The decisions concerning the manner in which individual proceedings are conducted are best left to the trial judge.
As Hancock was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate or necessary in traditional civil trial.
[27] find counsel’s submission in this regard to have no basis.
The cause of action in this case was one of negligent misrepresentation.
See S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages, 2nd ed., looseleaf (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2009) at 5-19, para. 5.460.
[29] In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only the rotten wooden beam, but also the cracks in the foundation, could have been discovered by Hancock or by his property inspector.
[30] In my opinion, the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as well.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment.
The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement.
When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one.
He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall.
The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced.
The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair.
The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair.
Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam.
The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did.
The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state.
The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it.
The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation.
The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up.
The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made.
In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","[2, 201, 193, 197, 179, 198, 192, 183, 8]"
16,"[2] The main proceeding involves dispute between the plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, and the defendants, with respect to contract by which Sierra agreed to harvest timber and wood fibre from about 275 acres of land owned by the defendant Sterling Farm.
[3] According to the statement of claim, after harvesting began, the plaintiffs entered “a formal Timber Cutting Agreement and Lease” relating to the same property.
This agreement was dated October 18, 2006.
Conclusion [29] I am not satisfied that Sierra has established conduct on the part of Sterling Farm to justify the maintenance of the attachment order.
An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy, and I am satisfied that its existence will hinder any attempt by Sterling Farm to resume or expand its operations.
An attachment order should not be maintained on the basis of suspicion and supposition, which is the essence of the plaintiff’s position in support (for instance, the supposition relating to the significance of the property online entry).
Both the former Rule 49.01 and the current Rule 44.02 are clear in requiring the applicant to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions.
[31] I award costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.","The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor.
The latter was not opposed.
There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence.
The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court.
Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested.
Neither party has a connection to Halifax.
The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County.
The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant.
An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations.
Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order.
The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil.
The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders.
The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions.
The affidavit in question was flawed.
It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","[2, 167, 168, 4, 175, 5, 172, 173]"
17,"He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code.
For the reasons that follow, have decided to allow Mr. Lundrigan’s appeal, and, rather than ordering fourth trial, to stay the proceedings.
The trial judge there describes the history of this prosecution, as follows:
The Crown again appealed on the basis that Judge Green had found that he could not consider the accused's high readings in regard to the accused's credibility.
CORRIGENDUM DATED March 6, 2015 BARRINGTON-FOOTE J.
As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
[23] In the result, the appellant cannot claim that this argument was raised for the first time on appeal, or that he was surprised or prejudiced in his ability to respond.
Rather, it is quite clear, based on the evidence as a whole - including the appellant\'s admissions as to when he drove to the grid road - that the appellant had care and control, not more than approximately ten minutes before he was first approached by the police.","The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed.
The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle.
The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c);
the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice;
2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed;
3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard.
The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence.
The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;
 4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively.
The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results.
The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error.
The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law;
5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue.
The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice;
and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness.
The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial.
Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases.
Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong.
The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","[615, 4, 7, 608, 617, 2, 26, 601]"
18,"[2] The appellant appeals her conviction, and raises numerous grounds of appeal.
Nevertheless, it would be helpful, before dealing with the appellant’s grounds of appeal, to provide background, and to set out in some detail the evidence which the jury heard in this case.
Just as the MacRae motor vehicle made that maneuver, the appellant’s motor vehicle veered back into its own lane.
2. The importance of deciding the case only on the evidence heard in the courtroom was stressed to all of the members of the jury by the trial judge on several occasions during the course of the trial;
138) Counsel for the appellant made no submission, either in his factum or in his oral presentation on grounds 5, 7, and 10 of his notice of appeal.
139) In his factum dealing with the 12th ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant says the following concerning grounds 5, 7, and 10:
Grounds No. 5, 7, and 10, in addition to the other arguments made in this legal brief, point to occurrences in the trial itself that cumulatively bring the appellant’s right to fair trial and the integrity of the judicial system into question.
Further, with respect to the other grounds of appeal which I have dismissed in these reasons for judgment, since they do not, individually, involve errors of law, they cannot, cumulatively, warrant this court’s intervention.","The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol.
The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand.
She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges.
She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence.
Dismissing the appeal,
that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury.
Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.
Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","[607, 3, 605, 579, 9, 604, 602, 5]"
19,"[1] The applicant seeks the following relief:(a) A declaration that the charges against the applicant cannot constitute professional misconduct without contravening provisions of the Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code;(b) An order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee of the Saskatchewan Association of Licensed Practical Nurses (“SAPLN” or the Association”) from hearing the said charges;(c) A declaration that the charges are res judicata;(d) A request for an order for particulars;(d) Costs.
The Notice of Hearing provided to the applicant sets out that professional misconduct is alleged based on his:

S.C.R. at 31, Lamer, C.J. set out the factors to be considered in determining whether or not to enter into judicial review as follows:
do not believe that the category of factors should be closed, as it is for courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which are relevant.
[16] I am satisfied that the Act provides an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued and find there are no special circumstances here upon which I would exercise my discretion to determine the merits of this application or provide the relief sought by the applicant.
[17] In the exercise of my discretion, the applicant’s application is dismissed in its entirely.
The SAPLN shall have its costs of this application to be taxed.","The applicant sought a declaration that the charges against her could not constitute professional misconduct without contravening the Charter and Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; an order of prohibition to prevent the SAPLN discipline committee or Association from hearing the charges; a declaration that the charges are res judicata; an order for particulars; costs.
HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.
 1)No order for further particulars was made at this time.
The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN.
3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued.
There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","[60, 61, 3, 6, 2, 56, 54, 59, 0]"

The Honourable Madam Justice Hunter
Richards J.A.
I. Introduction
[1] These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Students’ Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the “Federation”).
majority of students voted in favour of joining the Federation.
[4] I conclude, for the reasons set out below, that the appeals must be dismissed.
[6] The Federation is an incorporated entity.
Among other things, it acts as an advocate for students across Canada.
It is allied with the Federation and operates to pool student resources in the provision of various services.
It must then conduct referendum on the question of whether it should become full member.
The Oversight Committee establishes the rules governing the referendum.
That issue, not the simple vires of the Council’s decision, is the question before the Court.
It was taken only after significant debate featuring all sides of the issue.
Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council’s decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.
[39] In the result, therefore, find it unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process.
concur “JACKSON J.A.”
JACKSON J.A.
concur “HUNTER J.A.
HUNTER J.A.","These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation).
The referendum was held in the fall of 2005.
A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation.
The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.
The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order.
They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions.
HELD: The appeals must be dismissed.
1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act.
He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign.
Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation.
The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation.
The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward.
An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary.
There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.
 2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case.
Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct.
The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section.
Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself.
3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum.
Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue.
Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation.
It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process.
The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","[199, 198, 2, 197, 196, 7, 0, 4, 5, 3, 189, 22, 190, 14, 17, 15, 11, 20, 185, 181]"
21,"Kaiser, P.C.J. JUDGMENT
The officers found the accused to be the driver.
Cst. Prince noted an odour of liquor on the accused’s breath, that the accused’s eyes were “glossy”, and that her cheeks were “flushed”.
Her speech was coherent and she was polite and cooperative.
[2] Cst. Prince made an approved screening device demand, and at 1:54 a.m. the accused provided sample into an Alcotest 7410 GLC.
She testified that this meant that the accused had blood alcohol level of at least 100 milligrams.
There may well be other Intoxilyzer models that are not designated.
Her evidence does not adequately advance the Crown’s case in this respect.
[11] It follows that the Crown cannot rely upon paragraph 258(1)(g) and accordingly there is no evidence of the accused’s blood alcohol level.
[12] Considerable evidence and argument in this matter was directed to issues of evidence to the contrary as contemplated in R. v. Gibson (1992), 1992 CanLII 2750 (SK CA), 100 Sask.R. 88; 18 W.A.C. 88; 72 C.C.C.(3d) 28 (Sask.C.A.), R. v. Simonson [2001]
S.J. No. 570 (Sask.Prov. Ct.), and R. v. Fox (2003), 2003 SKCA 79 (CanLII), 238 Sask.R. 271 (Sask.C.A.);.
Given my finding with respect to the certificate it is unnecessary and inappropriate for me to comment upon those issues.
[13] The charge is dismissed.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level.
The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'.
There was no symbol with it.
In the blank that followed was written '5000C'.
This change was not initialed.
The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model.
HELD: The charge was dismissed.
The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level.
1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.
 2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration.
The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown.
If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly.
In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","[5, 75, 74, 0, 8, 69, 11, 73, 9, 68, 6, 71, 72]"
22,"1) The respondent, Nevada Pateman, applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties’ two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October, 2005.
While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support, there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive.
A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 1, 2006 is warranted.
The order should be based on Mr. Gavelin’s income for the preceding year as that was the basis for the original October, 2005 agreement.
As of January 1, 2007, child support should be increased to reflect his 2006 income, being $112,064.
This order will result in child support arrears of $8,107, calculated as follows:
$86,871 Jan. 1, 2006 to Apr. 30, 2007
2006 Tables $1,531 mo.
28) Mr. Gavelin shall pay the child support arrears of $8,107 at the rate of $500 per month commencing February 15, 2007 and payable on the 15th day of each and every month thereafter until the arrears are paid in full.
29) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be costs in the cause.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005.
The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access.
The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive.
The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child.
That is the situation here.
There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis.
In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible.
The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation.
That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday.
This seems reasonable on an interim basis.
This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring.
It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased.
The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months.
He will have to be re-introduced to them.
A phase in period is required. 2)
The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years.
His gross income in 2006 was $112,064.
This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer.
The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes.
This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary.
The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3)
The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application.
The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006.
The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005.
He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006.
He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children.
The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.
 The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's.
The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs.
The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship.
There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application.
A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","[162, 158, 155, 154, 2, 164, 163, 0, 151, 152]"
23,"Decision: [1] The appellants, Delilah Delores Dixon and Peter Sheldon MacKinnon, seek leave to appeal and appeal from the decision of The Honourable Justice Patrick J. Murray reported as 2011 NSSC 5 (CanLII) and Order dated January 18, 2011.
[2] The order requires the appellants to vacate their home at 1437 Bay St. Lawrence Road, Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia, for a period of 70 days beginning at 12:01 p.m. on February 4th, 2011.
[6] The appellants seek leave to appeal and appeal from that Order alleging that the trial judge:
1. failed to properly interpret the meaning of the term “habitually used” as that term is used in s. 7(1)(a) of the Act;
3. failed to properly interpret s. 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(b) of the Act in regard to the need for community safety order.
This would effectively deny the appellants their right to appeal.
Balance of Convenience
Taking these three factors into consideration am satisfied that the balance of convenience also favours the appellants.
[15] I am prepared to grant the stay on the following terms and conditions:
5. costs of this motion shall be costs in the cause.
6. the remaining provisions of the Order remain in full force and effect.","The appellants sought a stay pending their appeal of an order made under the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act requiring them to vacate their home for 70 days.
The had abided by the terms of an interim order placing conditions on their use of the home for more than five months.

Their eldest daughter is autistic and unable to take school bus.
She can walk to school from this home.
Stay granted, with conditions including a requirement that no one but the appellants, their children and an approved babysitter(s) be at the home between 11 pm and 6 am.
Without a stay, the appellants and their children would suffer irreparable harm.
The potential damage to the children can't be measured in monetary terms and without a stay, the issue would be moot by the time the appeal is heard.
The balance of convenience favours a stay.
The appellants have followed the conditions in the interim order(s).
There is no suggestion the community has suffered harm during this time.","[46, 40, 8, 0, 9, 11, 39, 33, 1, 45, 32]"

1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance.
2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds.
3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","[131, 126, 124, 134, 3, 10, 127, 130, 13, 4, 121, 11, 119, 14, 25, 123, 18, 111, 118, 122, 112, 116, 28, 31, 20, 115, 21]"
25,"For the Landlord Jim Lorimer, President
BY THE COURT:
[1] This case raises an interesting and perhaps important issue under residential tenancy law, and in particular what it means when Landlord has been directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.
[3] The Landlord (specifically its president, Mr. Lorimer) and the Tenant are relatively sophisticated parties, and this tenancy concerns high-end flat in south-end Halifax which is occupied by the Tenant and two other individuals.
[4] The original lease ran from September 1, 2007 to August 31, 2008, and was renewed for one year.
[6] An application by the Landlord was commenced on July 10, 2009, and came before the Residential Tenancies Officer for hearing on August 24, 2009.
Had he ruled in favour of the Landlord at that time, the Tenant would have been faced with the same situation, or perhaps he would have had the option to vacate immediately.
That is, the lease has been renewed for one year and expires on August 31, 2010.
The Tenant has the advantage of the Landlord’s undertaking to accept an early termination.
[29] Of course, it is speculative as to whether there will be any period of vacancy or any financial consequences, but the parties at least understand now what is required of them.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31.
Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy.
The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st.
The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families.
It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students.
The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months.
After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful.
The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable.
The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty.
The officer erred in law.
The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably.
The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy.
There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld.
The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31).
Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","[72, 4, 8, 1, 76, 3, 71, 9, 68, 18]"

The entry of a judicial stay on the .08 charge was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiple conviction issue.
To come to this conclusion, without any interpretive testimony, was to commit an error in law.
What the verdict would have been absent the trial judge’s consideration of the certificate is by no means clear.
Consequently, I am obliged to resolve the matter in favour of the accused, and the conviction is set aside.
In any event, the Crown is alleging the existence of signs of impairment and the accused has offered an innocent explanation for them.
In those circumstances, the court should consider whether the evidence is sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that alcohol consumption was contributing factor to the alleged signs of impairment.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was convicted of impaired driving.
An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge.
HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held.
1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions.
2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment.
What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear.
The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused.
As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","[68, 69, 64, 61, 8, 63, 4, 5]"

B. Lynn Reierson, Solicitor for the Respondent
The major item in dispute between the parties in this divorce hearing is the amount of spousal and child support.
The respondent, Ms. Mosher, is also seeking unequal division of the matrimonial assets and compensatory support or a lump sum award.
But in many, if not most, cases the absence of accumulated assets may require that one spouse pay support to the other in order to effect an equitable distribution of resources.
... (d) the length of time that the spouses have cohabitated with each other during their marriage;
(g) the contribution by one spouse to the education or career potential of the other spouse;
I find that this continued inequality can be reflected by a compensatory or lump sum award of $18,000, to be paid in three annual payments of $6,000, commencing on November 30, 1993.
Taking into consideration all of the comments of counsel and the material that has been filed with me and my knowledge of the case, award costs to the respondent, who has been substantially successful, in the basic, scale category, on the basis of an amount involved of $150,000.","The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14.
The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker.
The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children.
The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation.
The respondent was to have custody of the children.
She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets.
Ordering support and an unequal division of assets.
The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace.
The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained.
The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour.
Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered.

The respondent’s argument that should take note of the comments of Barclay J. in Houston, supra, are well made.

HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly.
The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board.
There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power.
The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed.
The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters.
The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.
The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine.

I. Introduction
[2] The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code.
[3] The following facts are taken from the trial judgment or are uncontroverted.
[4] The two officers arrived at the Severight farm about noon.
After briefly questioning Mr. Severight’s wife, they determined that the son was not at home.
The questioning of Mr. Severight took place in the yard near the Severight home.
[20] The following example taken from the trial judge’s reasoning illustrates how he treated the accused’s testimony.
Mr. Severight testified that he told the officers to leave his land only once when Cst. Lariviere brushed away his finger.
The trial judge accepted Cst. Lariviere’s statement that the finger incident occurred twice, which formed the basis for him to find that the instruction to leave the yard also occurred twice.
[22] Capturing all of the nuances of trial in written reasons is difficult task.
An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply on the basis that the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.
Conclusion [23] We grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal.
In the result, the conviction is restored.","The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a).
The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered.
The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial.
The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored.
The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent.
The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning.
While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so.
The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate.
The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another.

[20] do not believe Mr. Colley’s evidence that he acted in self-defence.
Furthermore, his evidence, when considered in the context of all the evidence, does not raise reasonable doubt.
Nevertheless, do not believe that Mr. Colley intended for Mr. Simmons to suffer such serious injuries.
He appears to regret that Mr. Simmons suffered such injuries and is sorry that that was the outcome.
[21] In conclusion, I find Mr. Colley guilty of all three charges.
However, based upon the principles expressed in the R. v. Kienapple (1974) 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524 decision, a conviction should enter upon only the S.268 aggravated assault.
R. Brian Gibson, J.P.C.
Associate Chief Judge","Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction.
The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground.
The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib.
The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence.
Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge.
The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","[116, 120, 4, 5, 124, 8, 123, 1, 113, 121, 122, 111, 22, 115, 21]"

On Appeal From: Provincial Court
Appeal File: 6491
Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson
JACKSON J.A.
The Crown appealed the disposition imposed on B.D.L., a young offender, following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences.
Shortly after B.D.L. started to serve his nine month open custody disposition, he escaped custody.
He, along with another young offender, took truck from the parking lot of residence in Indian Head. police officer saw them in this stolen vehicle in the early hours of October 9, 1994.
On October 11, 1994, another police officer found B.D.L. in another stolen vehicle the steering column of which had been dismantled.
B.D.L. was raised by his maternal aunt following the early death of his parents.
Since April 14, 1993, he has been involved in series of offences.
In arriving at this conclusion we have considered our decisions in R. v. Shane B. (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file nos. 6436, 6411, 6372 and 6427) and R. v. M.(J.C.) (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file no. 6451).
Accordingly, the disposition of five months is set aside and one year secure custody, again concurrent to the nine month open custody sentence, substituted.","The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property.
A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape.
The Crown appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced.
2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","[0, 4, 5, 25, 9, 18, 17, 14, 10, 13, 19, 1, 3, 24]"

The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson
LANE J.A. The 21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code.
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order.
The appellant who was severely intoxicated at the time, was caught by clerk stealing several submarine sandwiches from convenience store.
The clerk sustained no physical injuries.
He was arrested on the premises.
The Crown concedes this was “technically robbery” and was at the low end of the scale of seriousness.
We also agree with the Crown the robbery was at the low end on a scale of seriousness and what originally would have been a simple shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.
In these circumstances it is appropriate to allow the sentence appeal and to reduce the sentence to one year incarceration with ten year section 100 order.
The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed, the sentence appeal is allowed and a sentence of one year incarceration is imposed along with a ten year section 100 order.","The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed.
The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness.
What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","[21, 20, 0, 2, 16, 3, 7, 19, 13, 15, 9, 8, 10]"

In the circumstances of the case herein,
At the time of the accident, the exhaust system
defined under the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident.
The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued.
An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found.
A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation.
The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act.
SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview.
It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event.
HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs.
Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate.
An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate.
The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke.
On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate.
The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction.
Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate.
Estoppel was not applicable.
Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act.
The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages.
These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1).
They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4).
Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle.
As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).
 3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear.
A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.
 4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","[10, 9, 843, 842, 8, 7, 837, 876, 838, 839, 852, 33, 864, 25, 32, 841, 26, 830, 829, 19, 866, 863, 41, 849, 808]"

Hayley’s mother seeks to be designated as her daughter’s primary caregiver.
She resides in different city than Hayley’s father.
Hayley’s maternal grandmother seeks to co-parent along with the father.
[5] G. K. met C. H. when he was 19 and she was 16 years of age.
Little evidence was provided to the Court about this child.
Only under cross-examination did this child’s existence become known to the Court.
Third, the court should be reluctant to interfere with custodial parent’s decision unless it is in the best interests of the children to do so.
[118] Again, J. O. is not to undermine G. K. and C. H.’s parental authority.
By observing these rules J. O.’s capacity to grandparent and have access will also assist to attain Hayley’s best interests.
J. O.’s independent right of access to Hayley should not be so extensive that, when coupled with C. H.’s access schedule, Hayley’s family life with her father, stepmother and half siblings is unduly interrupted.
[121] This is case where each of the parties have achieved measure of success.
In such circumstances consider that each party should bear his or her own costs.","Hayley is 7 years old.
In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her.
The father seeks sole custody.
The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father.
The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver.
HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years.
The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father.
2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found.
3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley.
He must consult with her mother.
The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship.
Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4)
A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated.
That is the first step.
The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest.
It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act.
5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful.
There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to.
An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests.
The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","[29, 1, 5, 667, 30, 4, 671, 684, 683, 679, 655, 22, 3]"

The claim for support was initially made in the Petition pursuant to The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2.
It appears the respondent has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children.

While it is apparent the respondent is less than an involved father, it does not appear that situation is new development in the relationship between the parties.
As a result, I am unable to find that there has been a material change in circumstances as required to vary the existing order,
and the petitioner’s application in this regard is dismissed.
The petitioner has been successful in opposing this application and accordingly is entitled to costs which fix in the amount of $200.00 payable forthwith.","HELD: The court dismissed both applications.

44,"[1] Chief Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court granted the parties’ divorce and resolved several corollary issues including the division of assets.
The appellant wife took issue with this division, citing several purported errors by the judge.
The respondent husband also cross-appealed.
[3] Having carefully reviewed the record together with the parties’ submissions, conclude there is no basis for admitting any of the proposed fresh evidence on appeal.
I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal without costs.
In May of 1999, they purchased home on approximately 7.5 acres of land located at Half Island Cove, Guysborough County (“the home property”).
year later they purchased an adjoining 100 acre lot referred to as the “camp property” together with third nearby 30 acre lot known as the “acreage”.
second related issue involved the proceeds from the sale of the Chicago property.
In this context I conclude that the judge in guiding Mr. Wulkowicz did no more than was necessary to ensure that the trial proceeded fairly and efficiently.
The judge did not act as Mr. Wulkowicz’s advocate.
[40] As earlier noted, Mr. Wulkowicz points to no error on the part of the trial judge.
He simply seeks relief because he feels mistreated by Ms. Murphy throughout the trial and appeal process.
It is not properly before us.","The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia.
As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets.
Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence.
The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed;
on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant.
Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","[1, 9, 0, 287, 14, 13, 280, 274, 6, 2, 21, 281, 273]"
45,"The Tribunal further erred in law in finding that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since many of the events raised since this complaint took place;
The Tribunal has improperly imparted to the City burden akin to vicarious liability or fiduciary duty regarding the alleged acts of harassment which either were unknown to the supervisors of Mr. Kivela, or were events in which such supervisors acted appropriately in the circumstances;
The Tribunal erred in its interpretation of the concept of “undue hardship” as it is defined in paragraph 2(1)(q) of the Code and in the common law.
The Tribunal erred in law in failing to recognize the legal significance of Mr. Kivela’s resignation from his employment with the City.
The Tribunal erred in law in finding that the resignation of Mr. Kivela from the employ of the City in 1999, was result of discriminatory treatment.
Here the appeal from the Tribunal is only on question of law (s. 32 of the Code).
Here, the Tribunal made such finding and that is within its jurisdiction.
[81] As to damages, the tribunal made the following statement:
The tribunal therefore retains jurisdiction regarding the calculation of damages.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE.
It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent.
The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability.
The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE.
The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability.
The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination.
The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship.
The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability.
HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed.
The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal.
1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review.
If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness.
In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable.
Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies.
2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer.
The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions.
The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan.
The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000.
But by this time, he was unable to work.
3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others.
It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner.
4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant.
The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination.
The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory.
5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship.
6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence.
There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions.
Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant.
If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees.
Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous.
It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship.
7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct.
The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination.
The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","[10, 9, 447, 13, 3, 6, 431, 17, 443]"

The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation.
HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant.
The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality.
The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff.
There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff.
The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company.
The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","[143, 142, 10, 147, 129, 144, 1, 5, 146, 7, 6, 134]"
49,"[1] On this matter there are two applications brought before the court, the first by the petitioner, Timothy Feist, for an order varying the child support order granted by Mr. Justice R.D. Maher on the 3rd day of August, 2005 by:
(c) Costs of this application fixed in the amount of $1,500.
[2] The second application is brought by the respondent, Susan Feist, for an order varying the custody order of Mr. Justice R.D. Maher, dated the 3rd day of August, 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent.
[25] Thus there is two-stage inquiry: (1)
The reviewing judge must determine whether there has been change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of the children.
In other words, if there has been material change, then the only consideration with reference to that change is the best interests of the child.
(a) By interim order dated July 21, 2004, Rothery J. determined that primary residence of the two children, Jill and Kara, would be with the father, Timothy, with liberal access to the mother, Susan.
[15] I find that as no material change has been demonstrated,
The order shall further be varied to increase the amount of child support being paid by Susan from $559 per month to $619 per month, and the proportionate share of s. expenses shall raise from 41% to 43% for Susan.","The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent.
HELD: 1)
The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12.
In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child.
There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother.
It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed.
Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2)
The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated.
It may well be that the child truly does wish a change.
It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent.
3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order.
There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children.
No material change has been demonstrated.
The application is dismissed.","[3, 0, 8, 13, 7, 71, 74, 4, 17]"

NOTE ON RETROACTIVITY
All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer.
On the other hand, the appellant had argued that the employee was entitled to retroactive pay from every employer for whom he had worked during the period.
[4] We note that if the arbitrator was of the view, in the first portion of the paragraph, that analysis of one clause, using one tool, extrinsic evidence, and onus would have been sufficient ratio to support his conclusion he was in error and indeed patently unreasonable error.
This is an incorrect proposition of law.
[5] However, he then went on, in the alternative, to rely on the other provisions of the agreement; that is, he used one of the appropriate, and, indeed, first tools of statutory interpretation for an ambiguous phrase, that is to interpret it in the context of the entire agreement.
While it may not be the one that any of us would have chosen had we been given his choices at first instance, it is a possible interpretation on the analysis, legal and grammatical, of the entire agreement, and accordingly we cannot find that it is patently unreasonable.","This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent.

The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head’s possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken, an acquaintance of the owner of 101138096 with the equipment advertised for sale by tender.
Tenders closed October 10, 2009.
No satisfactory tenders were received.
[18] Therefore ownership transferred to the respondent free and clear of the claims of the applicant, October 19, 2009.

[21] Therefore the applicant’s application is dismissed with costs to the respondent, 101138096 Saskatchewan Ltd.
It is further ordered that the registration under the Act made by Inland as registration number 300516894 be discharged.","FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment.
The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008.
Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009.
In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head.
In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration.
Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment.
In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number.
The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment.
Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096.
September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head.
The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken.
On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness.
As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment.
Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008.
The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009.
This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents.
The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession.
As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act.
When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009.
The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.
Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","[70, 71, 66, 10, 12, 11, 69, 0]"

[22] The applicant will have payment for the amount of its claim, interest as provided for in the undertaking and costs of the action.","FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty.
In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees.
The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum.
The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC.
When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies.
The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33.
The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.
 1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure.
2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.
 3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence.
It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits.
4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions.
A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings.
The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear.
The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt.
His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","[7, 127, 4, 121, 124, 17, 129, 21, 126]"

[2] The offence is alleged to have taken place at the home of the appellant’s brother.
The appellant had been asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter N.M.who was then nine years old.
The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent’s bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.
B.C.J. No. 1936 (QL) [summarized 28 W.C.B. (2d) 321]; and in R. v. Sakakeesic, [1994]
The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by N.M. in respect of the same assault is obvious.
It does not raise the issue of N.M. having “engaged in sexual activity”.
[17] In my view, the failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.
[19] In the result, the appeal is allowed and a new trial ordered.
concur JACKSON J.A.","The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant.
The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault.
The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother.
The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter.
The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.
The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment.
The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person.
The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.
It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex.
The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault.
It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon.
That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred.
The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious.
That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","[0, 167, 2, 175, 1, 10, 171, 6, 163, 8, 160, 9, 164]"

The defendants' claim for contribution and indemnity arises out of these paragraphs.
(3) Should paragraphs 8 through 12 and paragraph 15 be struck out on the basis that the defendants have not obtained the leave of this Court to bring third party proceedings, as required by s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C-31?
On that basis alone I am satisfied that the defendants have an arguable case and that the third party claim discloses a reasonable cause of action.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building.
The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation.
The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence.
In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings.
(1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action.
It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed.
It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.
(2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.","[99, 0, 90, 95, 6, 85, 5, 13, 89]"

Travis Anthony Tubello, born October 6, 1993;
Jonathan Stefano Tubello, born May 16, 1995.
The respondent continues to live in the matrimonial home.
Neither had any criticism of substance about the ability of the other to parent the children effectively.
[4] During their married life together both parties were involved in the day-to-day care of the children.
Apart from maternity leave the petitioner was employed outside of the home throughout the marriage.
The respondent was unemployed at various times and during these periods played substantial role in the day-to-day care of the children.
During the day the children were looked after by their paternal grandparents with the exception of two or three days spent with babysitter.
The first involved the value of the respondent’s 1988 GMC van.

The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays.
The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered.
The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record.
HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother.
She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs.
The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon.
Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems.
The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order.
He failed to make support payments as ordered.
The father was to pay child support of $449.
Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.

The trial judge's reasons for judgment state that as long as the parties reside in the trailer court, the parties are to share joint custody.
On the hearing of this appeal, the parties were agreed that Mrs. Collins is no longer residing in the trailer court.
In light of this, the nature of the custody order and its adjuncts such as the order not to remove the children from the jurisdiction have become unclear.

Delores O'Neill, for the Defence
T.V.G., you were convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting B.S., your common‑law spouse.
The offence is contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.
The evidence presented to the jury was that you and Ms. B.S. had separated few days before this offence.
You called her late in the night preceding the offence.
It says: ""This harm includes not just the haunting fear of another attack, the painful struggle with feeling that somehow the victim is to blame, and the sense of violation or outrange, but also lingering sense of powerlessness.
It carries possible maximum sentence of ten years.
In R. v. Blackburn, the accused broke into the home of an eighty‑six year old woman and raped her.
Sir, I am persuaded that a fit and proper sentence for your crime, taking into account the circumstances of this offence and the requirements of denunciation and general deterrence,
is a period of incarceration of two years and eight months, the total being thirty‑two months.
In view of T.V.G.'s financial circumstances, and the fact that he is facing lengthy period of incarceration, am not going to impose victim fine surcharge.","The defendant was convicted by a jury of sexually assaulting his common law spouse.
They had separated; she continued to reside in the home with the children.

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares.
The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected.
At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750.
1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted.
There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated.
2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.","[145, 4, 144, 15, 133, 0, 143]"

Canada Life sought to insure the mortgage with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through its mortgage insurance program.
Initially Mr. Muttart defended Lee in the foreclosure action, but Lee is now represented by his present counsel.
In the alternative he held that there had been waiver by the plaintiff placing its state of mind in issue.
He held that the case before him was analogous to the case in Allarcom Ltd.
A. It was, but on the one hand it was none of my business.
A. Well because it wasn't any of my business.
CONCLUSION [29] On the basis of these various grounds I am prepared to order disclosure.

During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate.
No privilege was claimed during the discovery process.
The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs.
Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced.
The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant.
The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.
There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","[4, 201, 5, 188, 185, 180, 196, 198, 9, 181, 22, 3, 0, 12]"
68,"Roper commenced work under the contract in July of 1985 and continued working until the contract was terminated by Devco in March of 1986.
Roper also alleged various breaches of contract by Devco including wrongful termination.
[3] The action was tried over nearly 30 days before MacAdam, J. in the Supreme Court (reported at (2001), 2001 NSSC 179 (CanLII), 202 N.S.R. (2d) 201).
The trial judge held that both parties had breached the contract, Roper by failing to perform and Devco by failing to provide the approximate tonnages set out in the invitation for tenders and the contract.
[4] The judge assessed damages in favour of Devco in the amount of $270,307.05.
These damages related to Roper’s additional effort, costs and expenses beyond that contemplated in the contract.
It is therefore not surprising the amounts realized were substantially less than the apparent amounts paid by Roper Ltd. for the equipment, particularly the amounts as summarized in the Ryder report.
[177] There was no satisfactory evidence the liquidation of the equipment purchased by Roper Ltd., as result of the termination of the contract, resulted in any loss that is otherwise claimable against Devco.
In the circumstance, am satisfied there was no loss from any forced liquidation arising from the termination of the contract.
I would dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant.
In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
Both parties appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed;
the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract.
The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation.
Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","[6, 312, 9, 12, 314, 8, 7, 1, 321, 315]"

[3] MLG challenges the Administrative Judge’s order ordering MLG to contact ESI Software, Inc. (“ESI”) and arrange for ESI to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the “live data” in MLG’s present billing program.
[5] There have been several judgments of the Administrative Judge dealing with the verification of MLG’s legal fees and disbursements, all of which provide more extensive background to the issue before me.
[6] restatement of the context in which the claims and the verification process arose has two aspects.
The Administrative Judge could simply have ordered MLG to supply the new information in form that is compatible with the redacted electronic billing records.
He was obviously attempting to be helpful by suggesting to MLG what it might do to resolve its issue with ESI and obtain the compatible electronic records.
[39] The Administrative Judge made no error when he said the parties were agreed on common database because that is exactly what MLG requested in its Prayer for Relief.
Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the verification process moves along.
The prospective respondent shall have its costs in the usual manner.","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers.
The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants.
The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements.
In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed.
When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate.
The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement.
They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions.
The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program.
Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees.
Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them.
Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority.
In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan.
Leave to appeal was denied.
The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.
The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","[1, 178, 172, 174, 9, 168, 169, 11, 6]"

4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case.
In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded.
It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence.
It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.
 5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings.
Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded.
6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test.
Both the subjective and objective tests were met.
The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test).
Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes.
However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence.
The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle.
While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied.
There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel.
He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver.
Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable.
It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city.
The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there.
It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant.
On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied.
There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected.
The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","[11, 7, 23, 12, 4, 8, 33, 15, 14, 626, 35, 635, 624, 3, 20]"

[1] We have concluded that the order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim of Carry the Kettle First Nation was made in error.
The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by Ms Thompson to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings.
Having come to this conclusion, we are left to either set aside the order and remit the application to the Court of Queen’s Bench for appropriate disposition or to address the merits of the application ourselves.
[3] The pleading furnishes much in the way of particulars of the alleged fraud, specifying the source and purpose of the funds entrusted to Carry the Kettle First Nation that Ms Thompson, while employed in an administrative capacity by the First Nation, is alleged to have diverted to her own use or the use of others, including members of her family.
And discovery, both documentary and oral, lies ahead.
In the circumstances, we have decided to allow the appeal but without an order for costs in favour of Carry the Kettle First Nations.
[6] In leaving the case we want to commend counsel.
They presented the case on appeal in keeping with the best traditions of the legal profession, matter their clients should know about and appreciate.","The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim.
The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application.
The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench.
While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173.
The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings.
The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","[19, 20, 0, 5, 4, 3, 18, 15, 11, 6]"

[1] It will not be necessary for us to call upon counsel for the respondent, Ken Yaganiski, for each of us is of the view that, even if his conduct constituted breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, Belterra Corporation, Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.
Assuming it did (which is to put the case for the appellant at its highest), Belterra has not satisfied us that it suffered any loss attributable to the breach.
We are not satisfied of this, having regard for the following facts: (i) effective July 1, 2000, Mato Corporation independently terminated its distributorship agreement with Belterra, meaning Belterra could no longer obtain Mato products for sale to its customers: (ii) in the ensuing year Belterra was able to sell existing inventory of Mato products to its customers at profit, which in fact it did: (iii) there is no evidence establishing that Belterra was unable to sell all of its existing inventory to its existing customers during the year, and no evidence that it was unable to do so by reason of anything the respondent did or might have done in breach of his contract with Belterra.
As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent. 
[4] Hence, we have decided to dismiss the appeal.
The appeal is dismissed with costs, such costs to be taxed as usual on the basis of double column 5 of the Court of Appeal Tariff of costs.","The appellant appeal arguing that the respondent's conduct in soliciting the customers of the appellant constituted a breach of contract.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach.
The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.
This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.
As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","[0, 11, 12, 3, 6, 10, 4, 7]"

APPEAL DIVISION
Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: MACDONALD, J.A.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years.
The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena.
The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial.
He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued.
The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial.
The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear.
He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.
Dismissing the appeal,
(1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","[200, 189, 199, 192, 13, 2, 6, 9, 195, 202, 196, 184, 185, 183, 193, 30]"
77,"[1] Ms. Terry appeals an order of Vernon MacDonald, J.S.C. (Fam. Div.) which, in response to an application by Mr. Francis to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month.
Ms. Terry submits that the judge erred in principle by allowing Mr. Francis’ variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation.
In fact we were told at the hearing that Mr. Francis had never paid any child support voluntarily under these orders and that what had been recovered was as result of the efforts of the Maintenance Enforcement Program placing garnishments against his wages.
[4] In April of 2003, less than a year after the variation application to Justice MacLellan, with arrears now approaching $4000, Mr. Francis again applied to vary the maintenance order.
In support of his application, he filed an incomplete Statement of Financial Information.

The mother appealed.

78,"[1] The applicant, Landswest School Division No. 123, asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land (proposed Parcel G) located within the SW 15-37-28 W3M owned by the respondent, Neil Klein.
[2] The issue arises in rather complex fact situation.
In 1994, the School Division’s predecessor (the Kerrobert School Division #44) sold 7.5 acre parcel of land to purchasers (the Flads), in the belief it was selling an existing parcel of land commonly known as “the old St. Mary’s School site”.
[5] The Flads have been in occupation of proposed Parcel G, using the property as residence and constructing corrals for use in their livestock operation.
Neither the Flads, nor the Episcopal Corporation were involved as parties to the agreement, although presumably the School Division intended to effect reconveyance of Parcel to the rightful owner.
The vesting order was made on notice of motion as the facts were not in issue.
The Court of Appeal held that lasting improvements had been made on the lots in the mistaken belief as to title, and judge was empowered under s. to make vesting orders rather than awarding monetary compensation.
There will undoubtedly have to be some future consideration given to bringing all the interested parties together in consolidated or joined proceedings in the interests of effective adjudication.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land.
The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act.
HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order.
Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders.
The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2)
While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings.
Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act.
The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3)
The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","[0, 144, 10, 4, 18, 3, 136, 138]"
79,"[1] On March 15, 2018, the plaintiff, Douglas Sollows Architect Inc. [Sollows], obtained default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation [Key], totalling $102,703.62 plus costs assessed at $1,598.50.
[3] Counsel for Key submits that the default judgment should be set aside because Sollows has entered judgment that is greater than the amount due.
Counsel refers to Beaver Lumber Company Hopfauf, 1932 CanLII 192 (SK CA), [1932]
11 It is clear from number of authorities that it is on the allegations in the pleadings that default judgment must be signed: McCoy v. Laberge, 1929 CanLII 134 (SK CA), [1929]
W.W.R. 154, 23 Sask. L.R. 544; Wagar v. Little (No. 2) 1923 CanLII 672 (AB CA), [1924]
In reaching these conclusions, acknowledge the logic and merit of Moir J.’s reasoning, but cannot adopt because of the existing precedent in this jurisdiction and for the additional reasons have outlined.
This is an appropriate situation to exercise the judicial discretion provided by Rule 10-13 and set aside Sollows’ default judgment.
While costs are often granted in such case, upon considering the entire set of circumstances that led to this application, Sollows should not have costs awarded against it for what was actually result of electoral turmoil within Key’s own governance.","HELD: The application was granted.
The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence.
The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due.
The judgment was also set aside on the merits.
It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action.
As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.
The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","[4, 5, 8, 112, 7, 115, 107, 0]"
80,"[2] This application deals with an application by Ms. Nygren for payment by Mr. Johnson of his pro rata share of the costs for Amanda’s post-secondary education expenses.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
The relevant portion of the order in relation to Amanda is the following:
1.(b) The child, Amanda Nygren, born May 29, 1989, ceased to be child within the meaning of the Divorce Act commencing and including July 1, 2007.
1. The Petitioner’s application for child support for the university year of 2009/2010 has been abandoned.
2. The application for child support for 2008/2009 for university expenses is adjourned sine die returnable on 21 days’ notice, along with updated additional materials.
question as result her needing to have an apartment close to the college as well as her indication of $90.00 for cab fare.
Yet she deposes that only $3,067.65 was used for payment of her expenses.
She is responsible for some significant loans, but in my view she has responsibility to fund her own education, particularly when it appears she did not apply herself to achieving some success.
Ms. Nygren deposes she was fully supportive of Amanda’s choices throughout.
These monies may be applied by Mr. Johnson directly to Amanda’s outstanding debts.","The petitioner brought an application to compel the respondent to pay his pro rata share of the costs for the child's post-secondary education expenses.
The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties.
The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance.
HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence.
Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.
The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.
The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies.
The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.
The costs owed by the petitioner to the respondent are set-off against the amount owing; the respondent shall pay $3,452 to the child's outstanding debts by or before February 15, 2011.","[148, 141, 11, 142, 4, 2, 12, 144, 5, 129, 1]"

84,"Viva voce evidence on the two remaining counts was heard on December 13th and 14th, 2000; the Court reserved decision at that time until January 19th, 2001.
In the interim, counsel for both parties submitted post-hearing briefs to the Court for its consideration.
Jennifer Purdy, 21-year old friend of the accused Jessica Dale Knox, testified that on the evening of October 16th, 1999 she and Jessica drove into Halifax from Terrence Bay in white Corsica motor vehicle.
They arrived at the Green Street residence of Denise Hodge around 10:00 p.m. She did not recall taking alcohol to the premises or whether she and Ms. Knox consumed any alcohol at the residence before leaving to attend downtown establishment called the Pacifico.
Ms. Purdy stated the accused had vodka and Sprite at the Pacifico.
While the Court is highly suspicious of the chain of events which culminated in the horrific accident on the Prospect Road wherein loss of life and bodily harm resulted, the Court cannot found conviction on suspicion alone.
In civil proceedings, Ms. Knox may be competent and compellable witness for discovery.
Since the crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the element of impairment by alcohol or drug, the Court is obligated to enter an acquittal on both counts.","The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm.
Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident.
The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing.
Acquitting the accused,
that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired.
The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","[1, 0, 272, 2, 6, 268, 3, 274]"

86,"Counsel: Jamie MacGillilvray, for the Plaintiffs
By the Court:
[1] All issues in this proceeding have been settled except to determine liability between Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company and the Facility Association for psychological injury suffered by Alicia Hartling.
[2] An Agreed Statement of Facts has been filed by the parties and now set it forth:
2. The Plaintiff Alicia Hartling was Jonathan Hartling’s cousin.
The Statement of Claim says of the father “he entered into state of extreme emotional distress or nervous shock whereupon he struck an object causing personal injury to his right arm, hand and shoulder and mental shock or trauma”.
As noted earlier the courts have not recognized claim for such emotional distress arising from the death of loved one.
I conclude that the emotional injury of an uninjured person is not covered under the “Section D” provisions by reason of the fact that it is too remote from the original contract contemplated.
It was not contemplated by the contracting parties to the insurance policy.
It was not contemplated by the legislature when they passed the legislation.
[18] Counsel have agreed that costs in the amount of $1,000.00 should be awarded to the successful party when decision is reached.
Haliburton J.","The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed.
Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured.
At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff.
The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","[0, 91, 4, 92, 5, 86, 3, 93, 95, 90, 8, 85]"

89,"At issue was whether the defendant, Hyndman, had an obligation to the plaintiff, Redhead, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1, 1993, until February 11, 1994.
[4] The main basis for the allegations contained in the statement of claim against Hyndman were centred on discussions which took place at meeting in Regina on October 12, 1993, at the office of Redhead Equipment.
Both witnesses were agreed that the discussions at the meeting covered the following points:
Repairs [20] Although there was no specific contract with respect to the repair of the leased vehicles, it is clear that Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard with respect to some work orders that were issued by Redhead.
In fact the evidence indicates that Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard’s creditors with respect to the payment of these accounts.
[22] I therefore find that the plaintiff\'s claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against Hyndman has not been proven and that portion of the claim is also dismissed.
[23] The defendant, Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited, shall have its taxable costs.","An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles.
At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993.
There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement.
It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them.
In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions.
HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs.
Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default.
Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act.
1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments.
Any verbal arrangement was never verified.
It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk.
2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.
The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.
 3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven.
Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.
 It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs.
Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","[40, 4, 5, 8, 39, 36, 33]"

[19] Ibid. at p. 380.","The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners.
Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners.
The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners.
Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance.
The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment.
The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal.
The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal.
SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care.
HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant.
The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian.
It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs.
There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian.
The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","[310, 309, 17, 306, 14, 303, 305, 298, 0, 297, 302, 9, 301, 18, 8, 4, 308]"

Each party achieved partial success in their approach before me, and as such no costs are awarded to either.","The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation.
Division of the matrimonial property is at issue.
The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments.
HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable.
In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000.
It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3)
Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income.
The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use.
It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4)
The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle.
He states the personal use of his truck is 10%.
The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle.
This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5)
The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners.
The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him.
His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis.
There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins.
There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership.
There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father.
This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation.
This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase.
There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically.
There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term.
The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership.
6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year.

[112] In my opinion, Justice Tidman erred when he: - concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the Court in a s.14.25 application; - determined that the constitutional question posed by Future Inns had not yet been clearly answered by the courts; - determined that the extent of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, except for the allegations against chairman Darby, was unclear.
[114] I would allow the appeal, strike out the originating notice and statement of claim, except for the allegations against Mr. Darby.","The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike.
The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada.

Decision Background and Initial Findings of Fact
She is the mother of the Accused Calvin Klimek, age 44.
One of Mrs. Klimek’s sons, Merril, lives with her.
“Obviously words spoken in jest or in such manner that they could not be taken seriously could not lead reasonable person to conclude that the words conveyed threat....”
[40] In Clemente, the accused did not testify, and Cory J. referred to the court making its determination in the absence of any explanation of the accused.
In the present case, there has been an explanation by the Accused, but have disbelieved the evidence given on his behalf in this regard.
could kill you”.
The bare words “I should drown you” won’t ordinarily attract criminal liability.
However, all of the surrounding circumstances will bear on whether the words are innocently spoken, or whether there is something in all the circumstances which would convey to reasonable person the menace that harm or ill will befall you.
They cannot on any reasonable construction of their meaning lead reasonable person to doubt that they conveyed threat.
Decision [44] As indicated, I disbelieve the Accused’s evidence.
Considering all of the evidence, I find that the Crown has proven its case against Calvin Klimek beyond a reasonable doubt, and I accordingly find him guilty of the charge as amended.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners.
The accused's evidence was disbelieved.
His constructed story did not 'hang together'.
 2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.
The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences.
Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility.
The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","[189, 2, 188, 5, 177, 185, 176, 0, 6, 186, 193, 182, 175]"

(b) public recreation area;
(c) school purposes;
(e) public building or facility;
12) Prior to the enactment of that legislation, subdividors could, and did, offer “lakefront” lots for sale.
In my view Sec. 15 is directed against discrimination that is not acceptable to the prevailing mores, from time to time, of our society.
215) Of course, Sec. 15 is not merely concerned with discrimination, but with “equal protection and equal benefit of the law”.
However, once again, am not aware of any case which suggests that that means that one is entitled to have prosecution stopped until everyone else that appears to have violated the enactment is also prosecuted.
216) Similarly, there is no law that the defendants can point to, as having been violated, so as to deprive them of “equal protection of the law”, unless every apparent offender is prosecuted.
217) Moreover, it will be noted that the right is to “equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination”.
But, at the end of the day, the law did discriminate against an identifiable group on the basis of legal characteristics.
It must turn on how “just” it is that proceedings be stopped.","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.
They contended the bylaws were inapplicable.
They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter.
Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province.
This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983.
Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners.
Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal.
In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983.
The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197.
The province had no policing mechanism for violations.
The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title.
In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve.
They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot.
Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department.
This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw.
On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure.
Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility.
Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities.
In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves.
Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments.
They received no response and issued an order.
Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking.
Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves.
On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP.
The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution.
The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act.
On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils.
Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992.
On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991.
The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not.
On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action.
Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes.
Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use.
The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted.
Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion.
If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court.
If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense.
Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private.
The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter.
HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197.
Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval.
The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority.
The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land.
Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve.
It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution.
The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter.
How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197.
John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197.
The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction.
If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies.
An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective.
The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility.
It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times.
If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators.
This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use.
They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.
The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter.
Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations.
To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit.
A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law.
They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position.
Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances.
The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out.
There was no such evidence.
Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski).
The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution.
In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'.
In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'.
Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'.
The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'.
The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation.
The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators.
The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners.
Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it.
The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides.
The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action.
The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed.
Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants.
Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council.
The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid.
The delay by the province occurred pre-charge.
There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process.
Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination.
It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles.
It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.
 'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted.
Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15.
The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews).
This case should not be read so broadly.
In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","[16, 17, 519, 522, 20, 543, 513, 33, 18, 518, 523, 534]"

JUDGMENT KOCH J.
[2] The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012.
tentative agreement was reached on August 13, 2010 and ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010.
However the formal CBA, very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 25, 2010.
As the CBA provides for wage adjustments going back to April 1, 2008, it requires substantial lump-sum adjustment payment for many of the employees.
The compilation of the entitlement of each affected employee is elaborate and must be done by well-trained personnel.
[19] I find that it is not appropriate for me to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010.
Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a “best approximation” of entitlement.
In the long run the results of such solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic.
[21] The defendants’ motion is dismissed.
The plaintiffs’ motion is dismissed.
appreciate the thorough research and able submissions of counsel.
will entertain submissions as to costs if counsel so request.","Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement.
The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year.
This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates.
In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration.
The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme.
The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed.
While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case.
While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages.
It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations.
It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation.
The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","[82, 83, 85, 84, 1, 7, 6, 5, 0, 12, 75, 76, 8, 79]"

That on or about the 20th day of February, 2005 at T[…] First Nation, in the Province of Saskatchewan did being at large on his undertaking given to an officer in charge and being bound to comply with condition of that undertaking directed by the said officer in charge fail without lawful excuse to comply with the condition to wit: abstain from communicating with L.L.A. contrary to section 145(5.1) of the Criminal Code.
5. That between the 9th day of June 2005 and the 30th day of September 2005 at P[…] First Nation, in the Province of Saskatchewan did wilfully attempt to obstruct or pervert the course of justice in judicial proceeding by dissuading or attempting to dissuade L.L.A. from giving evidence contrary to section 139(2) of the Criminal Code.

The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence.
The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement.
The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender.
HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges.
The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence.
The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour.

[2] The plaintiff operates sole proprietorship known as Markham Contracting which is involved in house renovations through the winter period and landscaping in the summer.
On Wednesday, July 5, 1995, he was attending the Kent premises to pick up lumber and other materials for job on which he was working.
He completed his business, chatted with Kent employees and then proceeded along the front of the desk, intending to walk towards and through the glass doors to the lumber yard.
As he turned the corner of the desk, he tripped over the end of “dolly” which had been placed with the handle end against the side of the contractor’s desk.
[41] With respect to loss of wages, it is clear from the evidence of the plaintiff, particularly during the remainder of 1995, the physical activities required in the performance of his work necessitated his hiring employees for activities which he normally performed himself.

Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks.
The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury.
However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door.
He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously.
The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path.
The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial.

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment.
The bills were issued in two separate matters.
In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue.

Docket: CAC 329645
Registry: Halifax
Appellant William Tracy Timmons
Judges: Oland, Fichaud and Farrar, JJ.A.
Appeal Heard: November 15, 2010, in Halifax, Nova Scotia","The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused.
Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police.
They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside.
Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home.
The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home.
From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom.
They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants.
During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found.
The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants.
Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners.
The defendant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside;
although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis.
Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant.
Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","[6, 16, 5, 352, 347, 348, 351, 346, 340, 2, 21, 10, 1, 27, 32, 22, 335, 33, 332, 40, 327]"
104,"[2] The case involved alleged improper acts by the Accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude on one or two occasions, while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence.
The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence of sexual assault, or creation of child pornography, but only of invitation to sexual touching.
[3] The matter was set for trial on April 24th and 25th, and on April 10, 2013 Notice of Motion was filed, which was later amended, asking that voir dire be held to determine the validity of search warrant.
Notice was also given that the Defence wished to cross-examine the affiant who swore the ITO in detail on matters set out in the Notice.
These facts may also be relevant if breach is established in fact, and the question whether any evidence obtained should be excluded under the test of R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII).

4. That Samsung cellular phone was located and seized by Cpl. Davey from the Accused at the Residence.
7. That Cst. Paul Fisher from the RCMP retrieved fifteen photographs from the Laptop at the Residence.","Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code.
The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son.
The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband.
The parties were separated.
The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child.
After this RCMP were contacted.
On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained.
During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it.
They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach.
Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded.
The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography.
The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO.
The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above.
However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”.
When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home.
She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house.
She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle.
During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures.
He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs.
Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant.
Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included.
The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence.
The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her.
The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction.
The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources.
The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model.
The purpose of including the information was not made clear.
The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore.
The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused.
Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him.
The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?
 HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided.
The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded.
The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant.
The impact of the breach on the accused was serious.
Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well.
The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest.
The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","[275, 16, 12, 9, 280, 271, 13, 25]"

Second Defendant
A. William Moreira, Esq., Counsel for the Third Party
have concluded that the applicants have not. passed the. threshold of showing that there is any confidential information concerning these items over which solicitor and client confidentiality existed.
It seems to me that an applicant in case such as this one ought to be expected to lay foundation by giving to the Court some hint as to the type of information sought to be protected, without exposing the client to the dilemma described by Mr. Justice Sopinka.
Costs am not at all critical of the applicants for having brought this application.
In that capacity, I find that there is no conflict of interest and that Pink Breen will be permitted to continue to act.
But it took this appliction to put me into position to reach that conclusion.","The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them.
Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest.
Dismissing the application,
that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.
To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed.
There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client.
The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance.
In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand.
The court found no such evidence of this possibility.
It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","[7, 6, 0, 186, 5, 16, 18, 9, 182, 8, 170, 185, 29, 171]"
106,"[1] William Mayer (Mayer) died on June 16, 1997.
In June 1997 its value was $68,501.10 which was eventually distributed to the two beneficiaries.
[2] Garry Mayer by this action claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father’s estate.
It was, he says, his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund, but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants Darrell Nordstrom (Nordstrom) and Dataplan Securities Ltd.
[3] As this action is brought under simplified procedure, the evidence-in-chief of the plaintiff, Garry Mayer and his wife Lynn Mayer, is by way of affidavit while the defendants’ case is submitted through the affidavit of Nordstrom.
[4] The facts arising from the affidavits and cross-examinations which are not in dispute are:
[20] In summary conclude that Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of Nordstrom’s negligence.
He shall have judgment against Nordstrom for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity, namely $34,250.55.
[21] claim was also made for excess probate fees paid by the estate.
That was debt of the estate and no action having been brought on its behalf, this portion of the claim is dismissed.
As it was represented concurrently with Nordstrom, there shall be no order as to costs for or against it.","The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants.
The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son.
The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application.
However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered.
The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will.
The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.
 1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning.
The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business.
The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation.
The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools.
The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss.
The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","[72, 4, 74, 0, 5, 3, 8, 69, 71, 68, 6]"
107,"[1] At the conclusion of the hearing the court announced that this appeal was allowed with reasons to follow.
[2] The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Michael Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons.
The Information alleged that the offences occurred on or about May 30, 2003.
That letter, dated May 12, 2004, stated in part:
1. Date, time, and place;
[6] Two police officers testified.
(i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite to constitute the offence, ...
(iii) is in any way defective in substance,
and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or ...
[19] Section 601(4) lists the factors that should be taken into consideration on an amendment application, which include whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether the amendment would cause an injustice.
Here there was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused.
[21] The appeal is accordingly allowed, the acquittals are set aside and a new trial is ordered.","Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information.
The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences.
Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered.
The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences.
If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","[69, 0, 74, 3, 67, 68, 6, 2, 13, 9, 66, 65]"
108,"DEFENDANTS Brian J. Scherman and for the plaintiffs
July 2, 1996
Clearly, the defendant, Kasper Gordon Bawolin
(""Siemens""), for her trust funds.
His contempt however, is
the Court to withdraw from further intervention.
Proper identification of assets has resulted largely through
belated efforts by Bawolin.
Additional information demanded by Siemens can be obtained through the normal discovery process.
This question would not be so vexing but
exceeds $50,000.00, including very large disbursements.
Then an accountant prepared what amounted to forensic audit.
All of this was very expensive.
Counsel for Siemens urges me to order Bawolin to pay forthwith, the solicitor/client costs to be taxed.
Counsel for Bawolin argues that these costs should be left to the discretion of the trial judge.
As I see it, this is the more appropriate route in the circumstances.
When all the evidence is in, it may transpire that Siemens was in fact,
indebted to Bawolin as he now says, at the time of the
disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the
trial judge on the matter of costs.
conclude, once the whole story is revealed, that the legal
costs incurred to enforce production are out of proportion to
achieve. Costs are left to the trial judge.","FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds.
The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production.
Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized.
An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention.
Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.
 1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared.
Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties.
2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics.
However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge.
It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs.
It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","[4, 0, 44, 41, 5, 43, 46, 8, 38, 9, 40, 15, 16, 18, 35, 32, 19, 23, 37, 36, 30, 31, 25]"

[1] In the late 1970s developer and supplier of premises assembled land and constructed shopping centre at North Sydney.
Consequently, article 4.03 of the lease provides:
Article 4.32 of the lease includes:
An exception was made for department stores: “This paragraph shall not apply to any premises leased to the department store tenants, including those premises initially leased to Zellers [and] Peoples Department Stores.”
[18] The potential for factual dispute over the declaratory judgment is insubstantial.
Normally, an injunction requires trial because of the broad facts relevant to the exercise of discretion.
[19] Perhaps such contractual dispute is rare.
[20] As regards procedural fairness, agree that the time frames provided by the rules for the average case are inappropriate here.
I accept Mr. Grant’s submissions that his client should have time to make investigations, conduct any necessary discoveries, acquire productions and present any further evidence.
I would propose to set a timetable for conduct of discoveries, production by the receiver of any documents the receiver may be able to find, etc.
Or, can give my decision on the interpretation of the Sobeys lease and the application for permanent injunction.","The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores.
The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises.
Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises.
The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant.
The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises.
The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial.
Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","[3, 8, 139, 148, 0, 4, 140, 145, 132, 133, 11, 136, 26]"

SHERSTOBITOFF J.A. (orally)
[1 Michelle Thorne pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas and was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment.
[2 Ms. Thorne was an 18 year old single mother of one child and three months pregnant with second child at the time the crime occurred.
[8] This manslaughter was committed in manner and circumstance that obviously invited substantial penitentiary term.
[7 The sentence of 2½ years imposed by the trial judge did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence.
The following factors mandate a lesser sentence for Ms. Thorne: (a) she had no criminal record; (b) she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, and intervened to stop the beating of Prodanovic, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and (c) she seems to be doing well in all programs in prison.
[9 Taking all of these factors into account, it is our view that fit sentence is five years imprisonment.
and a sentence of five years imprisonment is imposed in lieu thereof.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation.
HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed.
The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature.
The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent.
The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.
 The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs.
The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","[43, 0, 41, 37, 4, 3, 6, 40, 33]"

112,"Counsel: Peter Craig, for the Crown
By the Court:
[1] The decision for the Court to render today is to determine fit and proper sentence for Mr. Eric Eagles.
When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and Mr. Myles fell down onto the concrete sidewalk below.
[62] In my view, crafting an appropriate sentence in this case should send message that vigilance is required at all times and that mistaken assumptions about workplace safety may have dangerous, and sometimes, tragic consequences.
have already discussed the role that contributory negligence played in all of the circumstances of this case and taking into account all of the purpose and principles of sentencing, make the following orders under Section 75 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act:
The content and venues for these presentations shall be mutually agreed by the Department of Environment and Labour and Mr. Eagles.
For greater clarity, the content and presentations shall follow the general outlines which were provided by the parties to the Court on February 5th, 2010.
Finally, in terms of the rehabilitation, reform and the educational aspects of this order and would also request that the overview outline how the presentations evolved after the parties received and reviewed the feedback.","The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site.
Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell.
The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew.
In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations.
The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard.
This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard.
Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","[169, 172, 1, 12, 161, 3, 168, 164, 4]"
113,"Luke decided not to go to university that fall and the respondent ceased paying child support for Luke.
Luke worked in Regina at Canadian Tire until November, 1999 when he moved to Banff, Alberta where he had employment.
Luke has also been approved for $5,000.00 student line of credit with the Bank of Montreal.
The respondent says he should pay child support for Amanda commencing January 1, 2002, based upon the Table amount for one child, reduced by the living allowance received by Amanda under her student loan.
The arrears are fixed at $718 per month X four months, or $2,872.
[33] In terms of s. 7 expenses, the respondent's proportionate share is 80 percent.
Section 7(3) of the Guidelines requires that any tax deduction or credit relating to covered expense be taken into account.
If the respondent is required to so contribute and if there is any unused tax credit available to either child, such credit should be transferred to the parents in proportion to their respective incomes.
If the parties are unable to work out an adjustment, an application may be made to the court for adjustment.
[34] The petitioner shall have her costs of the application fixed in the amount of $750.00.","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278.
He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time.
The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies.
He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit.
The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time.
Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans.
The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans.
At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001.
HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act.
They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents.
It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a).
The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees.
The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs.
The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay.
Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month.
The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.
 3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance.
The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2).
A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald.
It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget.
To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency.
4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due.
If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","[205, 204, 199, 194, 203, 196, 4, 13, 32, 5]"

115,"[1] The defendants seek to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.
[2] The statement of claim alleges:
The defendants received cheque number 70919 dated February 13, 1995, drawn on the plaintiff bank by Tri-Link Resources in the amount of $18,442.39.
The defendants carried on business as hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link Resources.
The cheque was subsequently reported as lost by the defendant, Bernard Sheppard.
Tri-Link issued cheque number 71066 as replacement cheque.
Cheque number 71066 was deposited to the defendants' account at the Royal Bank in Carlyle, Saskatchewan, on February 21, 1995.
On April 10, 1995, cheque number 70919 was deposited to the defendants credit union account.
[14] Finlayson J.A. found that the irrevocable nature of certified cheque and the liability of bank to the holder of certified cheque, which it certified at the request of the drawer or holder had the advantage of bringing certified cheque squarely within the framework of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4 and codified the consequences of certification.
[15] The defendants motion must be dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately discloses a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
[16] The plaintiff shall have its costs of the application.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.
The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence.
The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost.
Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque.
The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account.
Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a).
The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor.
The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.
 1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque.
The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants.
The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt.
The defendants had already received payment for their services.
 2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","[0, 2, 60, 59, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 57]"

[3] It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning Sinobert’s physical and mental health and the Court’s observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability.
That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument Sinobert had to be assisted by court official for blood sugar related situation that had culminated during the application.

HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date.
The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties.
This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted.
There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer.
Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing.
It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be.
On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend.
Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved.
The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process.
The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","[0, 56, 6, 47, 52, 51, 13, 14, 12, 8]"
118,"Counsel: Jeremy A. Caissie for the Appellant
But, in the course of the trial, Mr. Hayter’s counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving him to conduct his own defence.
[4] The facts are procedural and may be explained briefly.
Mr. Hayter requested adjournments before, during and after his trial.
There was no mention of Mr. Hayter’s wife testifying or as being material witness.
The Crown opposed this first adjournment request because the charge had been laid more than three years previous, the preliminary hearing had been rescheduled four times, and it had scheduled ten out-of-town witnesses to testify.
[5] The judge stepped down for ten minutes to consider the request.
No other judicial centre could offer an earlier trial date.
After returning from the lunch break, Mr. Hayter’s counsel addressed the court and stated that, after speaking to Mr. Hayter, she was seeking leave to withdraw as his counsel.
Where reasons are given, the mere fact there is evidence that weighs against the trial judge’s reasons is not determinative of the matter provided the trial judge took all relevant considerations into account in his or her decision-making.
That is, had the judge articulated the basis for his decision in this case, might have been hard-pressed to conclude it was not well-founded in law.
It contains examples of Mr. Hayter making mistakes in carriage of his defence.
Caldwell J.A.
Whitmore J.A.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.
In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial.
Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial.
It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","[343, 344, 5, 10, 323, 14, 22, 335, 16, 0, 9, 19, 321, 15]"
119,"Publishers of this case please take note that s.94(1) of the Children and Family Services Act applies and may require editing of this judgment or its heading before publication.
Counsel: M. Frances Roach MacDonald for the applicant
Robert M. Crosby, Q.C., for the respondent
Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate.
Finally, they state that they can present evidence to establish that there have been material changes in their lives since the Order for Permanent Care and Custody was made.
Overshadowing all other considerations under the CFSA, of course, is the best interests of the children.
also note that it appears that the children will be placed separately for adoption.
Are these all signs of immediate success?
The short answer is no.
However, I consider these to be significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling and, if necessary, extensive marriage counselling.
[96]I have not addressed the issue of access in this decision.
I am not willing to order access at this time, on the evidence before me.
To establish whether access with the parents would be in the children’s best interests requires further evidence.","The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children.
Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard.
The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency.
Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders.
Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed.
Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","[591, 592, 579, 581, 0, 593, 585, 24, 586, 5, 6, 584, 17]"
120,"(a) for judgment in the terms of the accepted offer ....
29(1) The court shall grant to the parties to an action or matter all remedies to which the parties appear to be entitled with respect to any legal or equitable claims that they have properly brought forward so that:
(b) multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning the issues is avoided.
(2) Relief pursuant to subsection (1) may be granted either absolutely or on any terms and conditions that judge considers appropriate.
Exhibit “A” has been filed with this Honourable Court.
[12] Once an agreement has been finalized and executed by the parties there is no further requirement for such confidentiality with respect to the concluded agreement.
[13] The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to the minutes in his affidavit.
The affidavit makes no mention of anything said during the pre-trial conference nor of any evidence arising from anything said.
There is no reference to any oral or written admission or conversation made in the course of the settlement pre-trial conference.
He is also entitled to refer to the matters occurring subsequent to the execution of the minutes in order to establish non-compliance with the minutes.
[14] In the result the applicant is entitled to enter judgment for $15,000.00 together with the costs of this application.","An application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184(1)(a) and/or Queen's Bench Act s.29 in accordance with the minutes of settlement agreed to follow the pre-trial conference.
The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application.
A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1.
The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit.
Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation.
If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless.
The legislation never intended such a result.
There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement.
Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous.
The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","[68, 67, 3, 70, 6, 64, 66, 69, 7, 11, 4]"
121,"[1] The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was student at Residential School.
The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Ann Elle was employed at the Residential School from 1943 to 1946.
[6] The plaintiff claims that his damages were caused by the negligence, breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty of the Attorney General.
(e) having occupied position analogous to that of parent, failing to establish and maintain systems to protect the Plaintiff as good parent should.
The third party claim is not relevant to this application by the Attorney General to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim.
[9] The Attorney General seeks an order striking out the plaintiff’s claims on five alternative grounds which will be dealt with in the following sequence:
The difference between the two is neatly summarized in Hogg and Monahan, Liability of the Crown (3d) ed., as follows at c. 6.2(b), p. 115:
(4) Subject to subsection (5), this Act does not operate to revive any cause of action in or against person that was barred at the date of that person’s death.
The other claims are made directly against the Federal Crown and are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate.","The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA.
The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School.
The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949.
The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19.
A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application.
HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck.
The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953.
The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively.
The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions.
Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c).
The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.
3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada).
Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial.
4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii).
As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct.
5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada.
6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate.
The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2).
Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24.
7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate.
SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her. 
LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","[0, 203, 206, 21, 22, 18, 6, 11, 191]"

RESPONDENT K.A. Lang for the appellant
June 27, 1996
The concluding paragraph of my judgment dated May
immediately preceding paragraph hereof,
the respondent will be entitled to recover","A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division.
The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'.
The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500.
At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach.
The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law.
None were found in either case.
The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.
 2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format.
The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case.
3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified.
Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct.
The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee.
They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act.
If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case.
In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220.

Appeal File: 6807
Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff
SHERSTOBITOFF J.A. (orally)
This is a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently.
Mr. Justice D.E.W. McIntyre felt that sentence of four years imprisonment would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
The appellant has common law wife, four children from previous unions, and an aged mother who is at least partially dependent on him.
He has Grade 12 education and was pursuing secondary education at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College.
Indeed, his only excuse for the drug deal was that he needed the money from ""peddling dope"" to pursue his education and to meet the needs of his children.
He said the robbery was unpremeditated and occurred only because the money he paid for the drugs was very large sum to him, and the robbery was necessary to recoup the money because the drugs were bad.
Taking all of these factors into account, and even allowing some discount for the fact that the robbery occurred during the course of an illegal drug transaction, the sentences for each offence should be increased to three years imprisonment, the sentences to be served concurrently.","The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery.
The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons.
HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently.
1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence.
Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted.
2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","[2, 0, 4, 3, 41, 37, 5, 9, 10, 36, 35, 34, 28]"
124,"Summary: The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the Defendant’s witnesses.
Issue: What costs should be awarded to the Defendant?

The Court must discourage such submissions and encourage spirit and level of cooperation among counsel which requires, courtesy, respect and professionalism.

[54] am aware that the amount claimed by the Defendant’s solicitor is more than this and that the time expended was more than what was sought.
see nothing unnecessary or unreasonable about the Defendant’s disbursements in the amount of $332.21.
Lastly the Court in Gouin appeared ready to deviate from the “usual order”, but concluded that no good reason was shown to do so.
In the present case, the Court considered counsels’ positions offered on the practice in Nova Scotia (including under the 1972 Rules) and exercised its discretion, in rendering its decision on the motion.
The Defendant first knowing the case it has to meet formed the basis of that decision.","The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered.
As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates.
The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays.
While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot.
The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion.
The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief.
The motion was heard over approximately one-half day.
Motion granted.
The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs.
The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process.
It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike.
The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to.
Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong.
His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response.
Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","[7, 8, 247, 238, 231, 232, 2, 246, 245, 4, 16, 15, 6, 230]"

The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002.
In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary.
A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48.
In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.
The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided.
Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference.
There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case.
The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short.
While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance.
Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial.

Concurrently with the filing of the Petition, the petitioner applied for interim orders dealing with, inter alia, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home, and division of family property.

They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children.
The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner.
The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend.
The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again.
In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order.
At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order.
A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially.
The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014.
In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent.
They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends.

The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him.
HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial.
In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012.
The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","[12, 272, 275, 0, 271, 258, 269, 10]"

CONCLUSION After considering all relevant factors and the weight I have assigned to them in the exercise of my discretion, I award Inderjeet Sandhu the sum of $285,000.00 Cdn. payable out of the estate of the late Rajbir Singh Sandhu such a sum exclusive of any tax liability which may arise.
Among other things the award takes into account the magnitude of the estate, and the substantial legacies to be paid out to Gurpreet and the other residual legatees.","A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband.
The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act.
Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate,
that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed.
To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement.
The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.
This involves a very broad judicial discretion.
Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","[0, 9, 644, 24, 20, 623, 624, 642, 21, 636, 637]"
128,"The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge in the underlying action.
This principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Monenco Ltd. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co., 2001 SCC 49 (CanLII); [2001]
28 The starting premise for assessing whether an insurer’s duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional “pleadings rule”.
If the pleadings allege facts which, if true, would require the insurer to indemnify the insured for the claim, then the insurer is obliged to provide defence.
The pleadings govern the duty to defend—not the insurer’s view of the validity or nature of the claim or by the possible outcome of the litigation.
If the applicant satisfies that onus then the onus shifts to the insurer to establish that the claim is not covered by reason of an exclusion under the policy.
[39] The insuring agreement between Sovereign likewise provided that the coverage was for compensatory damage to property caused by an accident or occurrence.
[42] Further I am satisfied that the work/product exclusion clauses found in the policies would relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant.
The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn.
The applicant was the general contractor.
Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant.
The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend.
If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered.
The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
 1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship.
They are not performance bonds.
2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship.
3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.
What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence.
Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","[13, 11, 16, 20, 4, 275, 279, 8]"
129,"[1] The accused stands charged as follows:1) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 255(1) and section 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
2) on or about the 23rd day of January, A.D. 2004 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood have care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) of the Criminal Code.
[2] The trial of this matter evolved over an extended period of time.
[3] Defence raised number of issues which are summarized as follows:
R. v. Landes (1997), 1997 CanLII 11314 (SK QB), 161 Sask. R. 305
R. v. Stellato (1993) 1993 CanLII 3375 (ON CA), 12 O.R. (3d) 90 (C.A.), aff’d 1994 CanLII 94 (SCC), [1994]
[40] In addition, Crown counsel indicated they had no submission to make in relation to this count.
The court finds the accused not guilty of count 1, being impaired care or control.","The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08.
The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
 1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch.
The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public.
The Court reviewed the cases.
The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat.
He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene.
Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle.
There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'.
The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle.
2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.
 3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused.
Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand.
In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation.
3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation.
He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief.
The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code.
The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath.
All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private.
After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer.
Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer.
He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests.
Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right.
To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite.
The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","[178, 182, 1, 181, 2, 3, 180, 6]"

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home.

He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98.
In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent.
At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules.
The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus.
The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal.
Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15.

At some time prior, Mr. Schmidt engaged counsel and filed an affidavit in response to the application.
[34] The statutory authority of the RM and the jurisdiction of this court were both wilfully ignored by Mr. Schmidt.

The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer.
That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it.
The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it.
The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order.
After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court.
The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment.
He requested that he receive additional time.
The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order.
At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect.
Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter.
When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it.
The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour.
HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order.
The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued.
The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw.
As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","[188, 10, 182, 6, 171, 7, 181, 177]"

The essence of the observations were that number of people were entering and leaving the dub at late hours and were believed to be under the influence of alcohol.
At about 11:40 p.m. on June 21, 1991, Corporal Matthews observed the accused Mr. Gerald Chabot and his wife enter these premises.
About an hour and half later, at approximately 1:00 a.m. the following morning, Corporal Matthews noted the couple leaving the premises and Mr.Chabot driving off with his wife in their vehicle.
Neither Corporal Matthews nor the two police officers who stopped Mr. Chabot observed the vehicle being driven in any irregular or improper manner.
It is at most evidence from which court might conclude that that level could at the time of the alleged offence have been different from the level in the certificate.

do not find that the trial judge failed to instruct herself as to the admissibility or weight of the evidence relating to alcohol consumption by the accused.

He was perfectly entitled to do so.
For example, he thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned trial judge, even though he appreciated the candid evidence he gave, clearly understood that the appellant’s memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.
He clearly accepted the evidence of the ambulance attendants and the police officer over the accused’s version of what took place.

The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery.
HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue.
If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value.
At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals.
Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged.
Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories.
Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings.
The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency.
The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories.
If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor.
Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.
 2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action.
Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency.
Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence.
The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages.
The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages.
It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages.
The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved.
Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor.
It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor.
In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded.
If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3)
The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered.
If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided.
4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff.
However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","[219, 222, 218, 4, 13, 14, 10, 220, 16, 20, 209, 5, 210]"

 The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.
Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children.

Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect.

Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support.
She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find.
The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income.
Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue.

The applicant was remanded into custody upon her committal for trial on charge of first degree murder following preliminary inquiry into the charge.
At the conclusion of the hearing of evidence at the preliminary inquiry the Provincial Court judge, in committing the applicant for trial, stated:
However, there is again, in my view, evidence which would support conclusion that the applicant aided or abetted Mr. Dickie in committing the offence charged.
There is evidence that the applicant, two days before the killing, knew of Mr. Dickie's intention to strike the deceased with the baseball bat, that the baseball bat was brought to her apartment and remained there until used by Mr. Dickie in striking the deceased and that the applicant's estranged husband was killed in her apartment.
In my view, there was evidence before the learned judge upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.

His Honour Judge Donald J. MacDonald","This was an application for an Order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and Certiorari in aid.
The applicant had been charged with the first degree murder of her estranged husband.
The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...'

144,"Reasons By: The Honourable Madam Justice Gerwing
In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
[1] The accused was convicted by a Provincial Court judge of having care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
[4] In our view, the appellate court judge while stating the correct standard of review, did not in fact apply it.
Further, it is inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the trial judge on those facts, which are his sole province, to say, as the appellate court judge did, that Swan did not see any indicia of impairment.
As noted, Swan saw the respondent driving his car in the wrong lane of traffic at, what he testified to be, relatively high speed.
[5] Given these failures in analysis, it is not necessary for us to deal with an argument now presented by the Crown that the appellate court judge also erred with respect to the nature of the charge when she focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was care and control.
On the analysis above alone, the verdict of the appellate court judge must be set aside.
[6] For these reasons, the appeal must be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench is set aside and the judgment of the Provincial Court is restored.","The accused was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired (Criminal Code s.253(a)) but acquitted on the charge under s.253(b).
The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving.
On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored.
While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge.","[53, 1, 56, 2, 50, 45, 52, 49, 5]"
145,"[1] The real issue in the application before the court is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (“SMI”) was in special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried duty of good faith and fair dealing.
The plaintiffs submit that because SMI also has an insurer relationship with them, duty of good faith and fair dealing arises between the plaintiffs and SMI obliging SMI to settle the plaintiffs’ claim against Glen Wesley Sweet, Michelle Cathie Sweet, Sweet Investments Ltd. and Jeff Keeler, (the “first defendants”) with that duty in play.

The plaintiffs then filed an amended claim adding SMI as second defendant.

f) Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlement of the plaintiffs’ claim as submitted in which liability is clear;
The plaintiffs have even referred to settlement discussions, negotiations and amounts in its proposed amended amended statement of claim to establish bad faith.
The defendant has been successful in its application to strike the claim as it relates to SMI.
The plaintiffs have been unsuccessful in their application to amend their claim to include the agents and employees of SMI as party defendants.","Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility
HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it.
The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants.
SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance.
The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation.
The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs.
Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured.
The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success.
The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material.
The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","[208, 209, 1, 6, 17, 30, 13, 203, 5]"

[1] The plaintiff brings this action against nine defendants (the claim against the defendant Albert Fazakas has been discontinued) who can be separated into four groups:
All-Rite Plumbing Heating Ltd.
[18] Although counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that the evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced in no more than two and one-half days, given the number and complexity of the claims against the Walbaum Group this estimate seems very unrealistic.
[19] The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than one day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or the Dumurs.
It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.
The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.
The plaintiffs shall not call evidence in respect of those claims on any other date without leave of the court.
All defendants other than those comprising the Walbaum Group shall be relieved from attending the trial on any date not designated by counsel for the plaintiffs or designated by the trial judge for adducing defence evidence and presenting argument.","FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided.
HELD: 1)
The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.
 In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials.
Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.

It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.
Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group.

The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee.
To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan.
Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier.
When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances.
She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security.

The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer.
The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction.
The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination.
The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'.
The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay.
HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable.
If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness.
3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise.
The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness.
4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule.
The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct.

It is signed by an unknown, unidentified person.
It is invalid on its face.
This is so, no matter who has the burden of proof of the validity of Mr. Paulsen’s licence.
If the Crown bears the onus, whether on reasonable doubt standard or on balance of probabilities, they have failed to meet it.
If the accused bears the burden, he has met it through the Crown’s evidence.
There was no valid section 27 revocation or prohibition in place so as to invalidate his licence.
Counts 1, 2 and 3 are dismissed.","The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations.
The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional.
The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license.
A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch.
The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one.
The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations.
The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door.
The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door.
HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations.
Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act.
The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.'
Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail.
There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act.
The accused was acquitted of all three counts.
It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","[4, 158, 12, 6, 155, 3, 15, 153, 16, 22, 149, 159, 0, 154, 11, 146]"

[2] The provisions of the Order addressed Mr. Reid’s child and spousal support obligations.
…shall pay to the Respondent for child support and s. expenses the sum of $150 per month commencing August 1, 2007 and continuing on the first of each and every month thereafter for so long as the child is child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. [Emphasis added]
[3] The parties agreed by this provision of the Order that:
[5] Subparagraph 3(d) of the Order provided that spousal support is reviewable “if the CPP claim is successful and may be recalculated retroactively.”
This requirement reflected the understanding between the parties that because Ms. Ellis-Reid claimed she was disabled and therefore unable to work, she would make an application for CPP disability benefits/payments.
It may also be that Elizabeth will have completed her first degree.

3. That Barbara Lynn Ellis-Reid will keep Jeffery Allan Reid informed of all communications received from the CPP disability claims administrators and provide copies of such correspondence to him immediately upon receipt.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

[1] Lori Ann Olszewski (Willick) (the mother) in January 2007 applied to vary an order for maintenance dated January 9, 1992, for her daughters Nicole and Kirsti (the daughters).
Nevertheless, we have also concluded that he was in error in determining that Nicole and Kirsti were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act.
At the date of trial Nicole and Kirsti were nearly 23 and 20 respectively.
The father was an airline pilot and subsequently moved to Hong Kong where he resided with his new wife while the daughters were growing up.
The father cashed in any RESPs when he left Canada and no further scholarship fund was established by him for either of the daughters thereafter.
It is clear that the daughters were not able to withdraw from the father’s charge for the purposes of their education after all the factors are considered and balanced, and that they are still “children of the marriage” and entitled to some maintenance during their post-secondary education theoretically starting September 2006.

(4th) 448.","The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support.
Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act.
The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.
 1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship.
The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship.
The relationship deteriorated in 2006.
It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally.
The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records.
The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him.
The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters.
Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication.
2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father.
His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.
The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way.
The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.
This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally.
The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","[216, 217, 221, 220, 17, 9, 12, 215, 5, 13, 218, 219, 4, 201]"

The Honourable Madam Justice Hunter
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve one year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
[20] Considerations of parity alone would have warranted sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case.
[21] We are also of the view that the total sentence imposed in this case failed to give due weight to the aggravating factor that these offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization.
[22] Accordingly, the sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside.
In each case, an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and one year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.
[23] In this case, each of the respondents has already served five months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, for which they should be given credit.
Accordingly, the total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.
The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences.
The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature.
The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders.
The Court found the sentences must be set aside.
The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.

above finding.
The plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.
The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases.
There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement.
The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title.
HELD: Declaration denied.
Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs.
1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.
 2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him.
His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego.
This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act.

By letter dated July 18, 1996, counsel advised the Attorney General would not be making representations on this application.
But when the amount to be recovered depends upon the circumstances of the case and is fixed by opinion or by assessment or by what might be judged reasonable, the claim is generally unliquidated ...
But if the claim is in its nature claim for damages at large, it is not in law treated as ""liquidated demand"" even if the plaintiff puts figure on the damages which he is claiming.""
Exemplary damages are fundamentally different from general or special damages.
Although exemplary damages do not appear to me to fall within the definition of unliquidated damages, which would mean the Prothonotary had no authority to sign the default order, am not satisfied that have had sufficient research on this point and decline to make definite ruling.
The failure to file the notice of intention to proceed in these circumstances cannot be saved by Civil Procedure Rule. 2.01.
The plaintiff should have taken the matter to court to seek default judgment.
The plaintiff is entitled to her ""throw away"" costs of obtaining the default judgment.","This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff.
Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice.
More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice.
This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence.
The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend.
No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment.
Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment,
that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence.
Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed.
The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","[9, 3, 6, 184, 185, 174, 2, 175, 190, 180, 181]"

165,"[1] Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown.
The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments.
[2] The parties were married on May 22, 1982 and had three children:
[L.C.D.], born […], 1991.
[3] The parties separated on October 28, 1997 and petition was immediately issued.
The petitioner obtained interim custody of the children by order of this Court dated December 19, 1997.
The respondent was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month, based on an annual income of $21,600.
The respondent was to have access on his scheduled days off work.
[34] As to the loan from the respondent’s mother, the respondent says there was $3,000 outstanding at separation.
[37] The respondent also had renters in the house in 1998 who have sporadically paid him rent or given him gifts such as $680 stereo, in lieu of rent.
[40] There will be a judgment for divorce, to be made final on the expiration of thirty-one days.
[41] The petitioner will have her costs of the proceedings, to be taxed.","Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute.
The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997.
The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100.
He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home.
He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share.
The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence.
He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother.
The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend.
2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited.
The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed.
The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent.
The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.'
The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate.
The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report.
3)The property was to be sold.
The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home.
A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour.
Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds.
4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father.
RRSP's were to be divided equally.
Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party.
Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father.
The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred.
No repayments had been made in 10 years.
The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility.
5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect.
The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory.
Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income.
No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof.
The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced.
6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","[5, 299, 8, 1, 298, 0, 6, 287, 12, 9, 2, 272]"

Indeed, the intention may have been to convey all of the frontage of 60' described in the original lot rather than 40' as described in that first conveyance.

The appellant pleaded guilty to the following charge:That Kevin Eugene McGuigan of Regina between 1 October 1991 and 31 October 1993 at or near Regina did commit numerous assaults on Ashley Bjornson by slapping and striking her with miscellaneous objects, contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Codeand was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation.
The more grievous conduct was the belittling and sarcastic verbal abuse the appellant directed frequently at the child over her eating habits and consequent weight.
At trial, the Crown and defence agreed that it was probably an instance where fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for.
We are mindful of the fact the Crown and defence counsel recommended fine and probation, but we must also be aware of the view the trial judge took of the appellant's conduct and accept that some degree of incarceration is appropriate given the position of authority he enjoyed and the existence of his past criminal record even though it does not include similar instances of violence.
We therefore conclude the appeal should be allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of one year.

Bankruptcy to assess the situation, consult with the
wishes to take action to challenge these transactions","Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them.
The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages.
The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them.
The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife.
HELD: A receiving order was granted.
1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations.
It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993.
The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.
 2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.

Ms. Killorn testified she had no previous emotional difficulties but had become increasingly upset when no one in the company would communicate with her about the altered sales compensation plan.
If an award of damages for mental distress was lawful, the facts do not disclose conduct by the appellant that would justify jury award in excess of $15,000, as gauged by awards made in other cases.
Conclusion The suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without cause and without notice.
In the absence of facts disclosing separate actionable wrong, as, for example, where defamation is proven, there cannot be an award of damages for mental distress arising from the wrongful dismissal.

171,"[1] The Crown has applied pursuant to section 753 of the Criminal Code to have Mr. [F.R.] designated a dangerous offender.
This decision addresses the question of whether the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender is “dangerous offender” and must be sentenced to indeterminate detention.
Dr. Holden’s report offered the opinion that Mr. [F.R.] should be found dangerous offender.
[5] The statutory requirements for finding that an offender is dangerous offender are
found in section 753(1) of the Criminal Code as follows:
(iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint;...
(a) it would be appropriate to impose sentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which the offender has been convicted;
(b) there is substantial risk that the offender will reoffend; and

[43]1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987]","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.
There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code.
It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met.
The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender.
This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel.
HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender.
He is sentenced to indeterminate detention.
1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000.
While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour.
2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.
 3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances.
4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person.
Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face.
Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time.
It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk.
5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","[613, 615, 598, 597, 14, 15, 1, 3, 26, 31, 627, 25, 20, 11]"

SCR 518 at para 11 [Hickey]).
Given his earlier finding that she had not received disclosure, this finding regarding unreasonable delay is insulated from review in this case (see Hickey).","Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal
The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645.
The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334).
An original support order was issued by consent in 2006.
It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable.
In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month.
In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000.
The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year.
One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances.
In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose.
The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him.
The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income.
The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears.
The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them.
In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009.
Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial.
The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct.
The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established.
The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order.
He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act.
Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order.
The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income.
Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","[8, 14, 7, 324, 3, 319, 317, 2, 5, 25]"

(b) where the defendant, when the judgment is obtained, is carrying on business in that country and that country is province or territory of Canada;
So also on an analysis of s. of The Foreign Judgments Act. Subsection 3(a) uses the term “ordinarily resident” while subsection 3(b) uses the term “carrying on business”.

The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan.
The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota.
The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction.
HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.
1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act.
2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there.
The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product.
The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address.
It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.
The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","[3, 0, 74, 71, 6, 9, 10, 8, 7]"

Hunter J.A.
see no basis for setting aside the decision of Justice Maher, who on variation application ordered the appellant (father) to pay his proportionate share of six of eleven extracurricular activities which the children were registered in and participated in at the time the application was made.
He calculated the appellant’s proportionate share and then ordered the appellant to pay 73% of the net day care costs and six specific extracurricular activity costs pursuant to s. of the Guidelines.
[34] First, it is impossible, without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children’s extracurricular activities ($2,615.25, on the evidence) would be considered “extraordinary” in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent’s annual income.
There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion.
In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis.
Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children’s extra-curricular activities.
The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.
[4] Supra, note 1, s. 7(1.1)(b)(v).","This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act.
The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.'
The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines.
The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent.
Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring):
All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost.
Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent.
The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities.
Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application.
There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge.
Per Smith J.A. (in dissent):
Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders.
This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion.
In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines.
First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income.
There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion.
Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children.
In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all.
In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis.
Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities.
This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities.
It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense.
The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.
The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","[168, 13, 0, 174, 178, 6, 164, 167, 3, 163]"

Self-Represented For the Applicants (Defendants)
Both applications were successful and therefore the parties are currently self-represented.
hearing date was set for June 17, 2014 and this decision comes as result of that hearing.
[2] am satisfied that the Sykes’ application is based on the following grounds:
In determining whether the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, the Court only needs to consider adequacy.
(9) This Act does not apply to claim for libel, slander, malicious arrest, malicious prosecution or false imprisonment.
[22] Section 65 of The Queen’s Bench Act refers to the granting of injunctive relief.
This is clearly a remedy this Court has no jurisdiction to grant.
[24] In summary, the Labuick amended claim can proceed to trial which will be limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees from the Sykes’ property onto the Labuick property and whether these trees invade the Labuick air space.
Whether there are branches overhanging into Labuick’s yard is triable issue and if Labuick is successful, monetary damages can be awarded.
[25] Therefore the matter will be adjourned to resume the case management conference in front of Judge Kovatch on October 2, 2014 at 10:30 a.m.
Costs shall remain for the trial judge.","The Court allowed the application in part.
It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree.
Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life.
The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed.
The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief.
The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","[108, 107, 105, 106, 3, 8, 101, 104, 2, 13, 12, 98, 22]"
177,"[1] Beginning in the 1990s and leading up to February 2007, Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (“Wheatland”) carried on business as farm equipment dealer at separate locations at Rosetown, Saskatchewan, and Elrose, Saskatchewan.
On May 15, 2002, TD entered into virtually identical agreement with Case Canada Corporation, Case Credit Ltd. and Wheatland.
There may be similar agreement involving Flexi‑Coil, but it has not been provided.
The existence and circumstances of the priority agreements are not contentious.
[26] The contractual provisions clearly entitle CNH Capital to refuse to restock direct ship parts.
As previously indicated, there is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique.
The single identifiable element to distinguish direct ship parts from parts shipped by CNH Canada is the mode of delivery.
So that, in reading the phrase “specially priced”, one is entitled to expect that the amount asked represents exceptional value.
It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH Canada to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer (ss. 50(22)).
In addition, the supplier is entitled to discount the invoice price, supposedly to compensate for restocking.
[29] I am not persuaded that the parts in issue in this case were specially ordered.
Therefore TD is not entitled to costs.","In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals.
In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR).
Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer.
Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH).
The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH.
The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts.
The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies.
HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for.
The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit.
But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.
 2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue.
It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH.
The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA).
While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act.
The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings.
The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts.
However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances.
It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer.
The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out.
The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer.
The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered.
They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","[9, 178, 177, 173, 182, 0, 11, 10, 167, 172, 155, 161]"

OF DECISION: November 2, 1999
COUNSEL: Gerald MacDonald, Counsel for the Plaintiffs
The action arises out of single car accident in which the defendant’s uncle, Vincent LeLacheur, was killed leaving him surviving his wife, the plaintiff Flora Burt, who was then pregnant with the second plaintiff, Shelly Dawn Seward.
It was served on November 4, 1997 on the defendant, Howard LeLacheur and provided to Judgment Recovery on January 23, 1998.
The action is brought under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act.
A. Oh, seen them.
She could have asked Howard LeLacheur that question but for some reason did not do so which find surprising even though she was at relatively young age and pregnant at the time.
To compound the difficulty surrounding this application, it is to be noted that the revelation even as made is based on double hearsay, i.e. from Howard LeLacheur allegedly to, believe, his brother, then on to daughter and then on to Flora Burt.
All things considered, there has not been established sufficient evidentiary basis upon which this Court can make finding of fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant.
In the peculiar circumstances of this case, I decline to award costs to Judgment Recovery.","The deceased was killed in a single car accident in 1972, leaving his wife, the plaintiff, who was pregnant with the second plaintiff, his daughter, as his survivors.
In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act.
This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant.
Dismissing the application without costs,
that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded.
This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","[66, 64, 1, 2, 0, 5, 61, 63, 8, 56, 14]"

180,"COUNSEL: Dale Dunlop for the Plaintiffs
[1] On December 30, 1994 violent head on collision occurred on the Trans Canada Highway near Woodstock, New Brunswick between two tractor trailers driven by the plaintiff Robert Fowler and the defendant Michael Magoon respectively.
Mr. Fowler was seriously injured in the accident and brought this action for the recovery of damages from Mr. Magoon and his then employer, Schneider National Carriers Inc.
In its verdict, the jury apportioned liability between the parties in the division of 57½% 42½% in favour of Mr. Fowler.
[3] Following the trial, an Order for judgment was taken out directing the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs Robert Fowler and Kim Fowler 57½% of their damages to be assessed.
(b) the plaintiff has obtained judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed.
The following is an account of those costs to date:
v) Permanent Impairment Benefit 3,077.85
10% Administration Fee Applied Against WCB Claim Costs 18,202.74
Total $270,381.28
Plus any additional WCB Claim Costs, Legal Fees etc. incurred until such time as the WCB is fully reimbursed costs associated to this claim.
encourage the Board to take these considerations into account in relaxing the immediate enforcement of its claim.","In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident.
Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff.
Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages.
Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied.
Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount.
The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced.
There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment.
Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition.
In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered.
Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application.
The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery.
Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","[96, 0, 101, 92, 15, 95, 9, 5, 10, 91, 86, 4]"

[2] Although not referred to in the notice of appeal, counsel argued on the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the learned Provincial Court judge to proceed with the trial.
On subsequent appearance, the appellant entered plea of not guilty and the case was set over for trial.
[3] The information was sworn September 27, 2001 alleging the offence to have occurred on April 27, 2000.
He requests that this sentence be set aside and conditional or absolute discharge granted.
It appears that in these unique circumstances, s. 687 of the Criminal Code permits that to be done.
[22] At the hearing of the appeal, counsel indicated that an effort would be made to locate tape recording of the sentencing proceedings and arrange for it to be transcribed.
If the transcript is not available, invite counsel to arrange for the Court to be reconvened to address submissions as to the applicability of s. 687 and to argue whether it is appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b).
On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction.
The appellant pled not guilty.
Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction.
Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began.
Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.
The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision.
HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.
 1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2).
2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession.
The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods.
The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft.
Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly.
There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.
 3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge.
However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines.

182,"[1] This is a motion for judicial review of the decision of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board (""the Board"").
The Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon.
The governing legislative provision is s. 26.5 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. T-17 (""the Act"").
Under that provision the Board determined it would conduct hearing to conclude all the outstanding terms of the first contract.
Wage issues were before the Board.
[19] note, however, that at no time was the ""over 45 days"" issue raised in the proceedings before the Board, as has been noted by the union.
The motion which brought this matter before the court for review does not raise the issue and it only came up in the briefs and in the argument before the court at the hearing of the motion.
[20] The two year contract has expired, the business has been sold, and to elevate this issue to the point where a rehearing would be required would seem counter productive.
Had it been an issue duly raised and argued before the Board, however, it would not have been easily ignored either by the Board or by this Court on review.","A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees.
The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go.
The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold.
To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive.
2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review.
However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board.
The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply.
The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory.
The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses.
3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)).
4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice.
Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties.
To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference.
Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","[89, 88, 0, 4, 85, 87, 6, 1, 3]"

At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d).
The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields.
He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October.
He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work.
The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated.
HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month.
1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income.
The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997.
Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past.
No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years.
The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded.
In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable.
The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck.
The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children.
His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine.

I see no advantage in pursuing the latter option, as each child would, in all likelihood, remain where they are on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the order being sought.

Dated at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, this 11th day of July, 2013.","A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).
The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs.
The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children.
They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated.
The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access.
The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister.
HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b).
The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister.
Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change.
The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister.
The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","[59, 53, 5, 1, 6, 60, 61, 52, 48, 41]"
186,"[1] The petitioner seeks interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children\'s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2 (the ""Act"").
The respondent seeks a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order of joint custody, pursuant to the Act.
[2] The parties were married in 1994.
They are both university graduates and teachers.
The petitioner was employed as substitute teacher at Richmond, British Columbia until the time of the birth of their son when she became full time homemaker.
The son had been enrolled in kindergarten in Richmond, across the street from the matrimonial home, up to the time of the move.
... [T]hose individuals who have the most current information on the children are in the best position to assist the court in providing the evidence of the children's state of well-being.
To require those persons to travel to Ontario to provide that evidence is not in the best interests of these children.
also adopt the reasoning of Wimmer J. in Breker v. Breker, [1995]
[12] I make these determinations on the assumption that the respondent will not disturb the status quo as to the residence of the children unless and until court authorization has been obtained.","The mother sought interim custody of their 3 and 5 year olds or primary residence of the children pursuant to s.6 of the Children's Law Act.
 The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody.
HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there.
They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months.
They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father.
The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.
The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC.
The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","[1, 0, 60, 56, 4, 57, 8, 3, 2, 54]"
187,"By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Caldwell
Caldwell J.A.:
[1] The Crown’s appeal from the sentencing judge’s order under s. 490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed Leo Harris Burns to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (“SOIRA”) for 20 years, is allowed.
We unanimously find that the sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code and, in the result, his order must be set aside and replaced with lifetime SOIRA compliance order.
[2] Mr. Burns was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault (s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code).
(a) the person was, before or after the coming into force of this paragraph, previously convicted of, or found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for, an offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c), (c.1), (d) or (e) of the definition “designated offence” in subsection 490.011(1) or in paragraph (a) or (c) of the definition “designated offence” in section 227 of the National Defence Act;
[7] Put simply, if Parliament had intended the narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1) rendered by the sentencing judge’s interpretation of it, Parliament would have used the same language in s. 490.013(2.1) as it did in s. 490.012(3).
Therefore, in our view, Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who commits multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or all together.","The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order.
At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order.
If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3).
Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","[26, 25, 0, 4, 5, 3, 6, 24]"
188,"[1] This is an appeal from an interlocutory order dismissing the appellants’ demand for particulars of general damage claim.
Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract.
Since 1996 the respondent company had, with permission of the appellants, used the property for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation.
The company purchased the property in order to continue these activities.
The respondent says, in essence, that because the property is materially less than the size it was represented to be, its plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property are negatively affected.
It was the respondent’s position that no further particulars were required.
The appellants therefore applied to Chambers judge for an order compelling substantive response to the demand.
Civil Procedure Rule 14.24 provides:
(3) The party demanding the statement or particulars shall, unless an order otherwise provides, have ten (10) days for pleading after delivery of the statement or particulars.
[13] The matter on appeal is an interlocutory, discretionary decision of Chambers judge.
This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result.
[14] It is my view that this interlocutory appeal is unnecessary and completely without merit.
I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. ","The plaintiff company sued the defendants for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract alleging that the defendants sold it a piece of land smaller than what it was represented to be.
The plaintiff intended to excavate and sell sand from the land and claimed damages including loss of profits due to the smaller amount of sand available.
Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits.
The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars.
,appeal dismissed;
the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action. 
There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","[0, 38, 39, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 9, 8, 34, 36, 12]"

Appearing: M. Longworth For the Crown
M. Simonot, Q.C. For the Accused
I. THE CHARGES
[1] Jeremy Angelo Mayer (Mayer) and Aimee Lynn Dagenais (Dagenais) are charged on separate informations with assaulting Jared McIntyre contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
Mayer is also charged with wilfully damaging the windows of car contrary to s. 430(4) of the Criminal Code.
At the close of the trial the Crown and defence evidence was applied over to and became the evidence on information 24417999.
[5] McIntyre testified that he then drove west to the end of the strip mall and around the building and, now driving in an easterly direction, drove slowly past the doors of Rockcees.
McIntyre took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family.
[23] do not believe that either McIntyre or Graham used two by four to hit Mayer.
[24] With respect to each accused, Mayer admits to fighting with McIntyre.
McIntyre says that Dagenais choked him.
Graham and Corfmat confirmed this in their testimony.
DECISION [25] I find both the accused guilty of assault upon McIntyre contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
However, the Crown was unable to prove that the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000.00.","The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266.
The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.'
HELD: The accused were convicted of assault.
Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout.
He smashed one, if not two, car windows.
The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize.
The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code. 
While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault.
The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","[6, 14, 3, 8, 4, 7, 151, 154, 0, 157, 21, 153, 162, 147, 146]"
190,"On February 28, 1992, Justice M. Y. Carter granted judgment for divorce after trial in which the parties were given joint custody of their two sons with primary residence to be with their father.
The judgment was pre-Guideline decision and the payments were tax deductible to Mr. Gore-Hickman and taxable in the hands of Ms. Hubbard.
[4] In January, 1999, both parties applied to vary the judgment.
On July 12, 1999, Justice Laing dismissed both applications.
He held that the circumstances leading to the child support award had not changed.
[6] On June 28/29, 2004, the parties’ youngest child, Kurt, went to live with his mother and in July, 2004, Ms. Hubbard began an application to vary claiming child support for Kurt in accordance with the Guidelines.
While Mr. Gore-Hickman requested Justice Koch to deal with support for Brett, the judge declined to do so, indicating there was no formal application before him.
It is difficult to justify situation that would provide support for one child but not the other.
This is not situation where long time has passed.
This would result in decrease in her income and may actually provide benefit to her in the form of reducing her tax.
[28] At the request of counsel, there shall be no order as to costs with regard to this application at this time.","The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him.
In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month.
The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive.
HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.
 1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court.
In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2)
The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met.
If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3)
By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him.
The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her.
There was no justification for the payment to continue.
It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","[247, 6, 15, 13, 236, 12, 16, 239, 26, 242, 22]"
191,"[1] The appellants were convicted by Young P.C.J. of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, S.C. 1990, c. 21 (the “Act”) and the Health of Animals Regulations, [SOR/91-525, s.1] (the “Regulations”) resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.
Erick Rodney Alsager (“Alsager”) was convicted of all eight offences, and the corporations under his control were convicted of five offences and two offences respectively.
The total sentence imposed by the learned trial judge was a fine of $69,000, allocated amongst the fifteen counts.
When counsel for the appellants first argued this case on appeal on September 9, 2005, accepted counsel’s submissions that the learned trial judge erred in law in imposing fines without regard to the offenders’ ability to pay, as required by s. 734(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-46.
Young P.C.J. allowed the appellants until September 1, 2006 to pay the fines.
[5] On May16, 2006, counsel for the appellants continued this appeal.
Because this is an appeal taken under s. 813 of the Criminal Code, ss. 683 to 689 apply.
Given these types of offences, that is not an error of law.
[19] In summary, other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","DIGEST
The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors.
The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000.
HELD: 1)
The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents.
The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public.
The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry.
This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.
 2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000.
The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high.
Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'.
Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit.
3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","[127, 2, 130, 1, 0, 9, 10, 17, 4]"
192,"The motor home did not cross the centre line and was not speeding.
Cst. Warner was concerned that the driver might have been drinking.
The impact of the detention and search on the accused’s privacy and liberty interests was significant, although not egregious.
In both cases the police misconduct and the ss. and Charter breaches were flagrant.
47 above, the cavalier approach to search and seizure demonstrated by the members of the roving traffic unit may not have been unique to this case.
As in Harrison, the accused in this case is charged with serious offences and the evidence is important and reliable.
[110] Accordingly, I find that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and that the standards is paramount.
[2] The Crown asks the court to infer that the accused became more nervous at that point because he was carrying illegal drugs.
The defence asks the court to infer that the accused became more nervous at that point because he had just been asked to disclose when he had last committed criminal offence.
[4] “VIN tampering” is not an offence known to either the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 or Statute of Saskatchewan.","The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles.
The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars.
The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000.
The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times.
The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol.
The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol.
The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver.
Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome.
The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous.
The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs.
The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new.
He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match.
He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match.
The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen.
The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property.
As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified.
A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome.
The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs.
The accused was arrested for trafficking.
The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking.
Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment.
That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer.
The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2).
HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled.
The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to.
The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen.
The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs.
The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification.
He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query.
Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband.
In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition.
The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8.
By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs.
However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog.
Section 9 Ã» 
The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused.
He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen.
His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent.
The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property.
The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property.
The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property.
Section 10 Ã» 
The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion.
However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer.
There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs.
The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2).
The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious.
The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.
His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements.
The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious.
These two factors favor excluding the evidence.
The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs.
The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case.
The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence.
On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","[444, 445, 436, 435, 439, 449, 20, 433, 21, 428]"
193,"[1] The appellant, Ernest Montgrand, appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. A-35 (the “Act”).
Under s. 198 of the Act, hearing was held to determine certain facts.
Over the previous three years, Montgrand earned no more than $12,000 per year.
[3] The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days after the accident, and for the 181st and subsequent days.
The provisions of the Act for determining the IRB for the first 180 days that are pertinent in this situation are as follows:
[21] Whether Montgrand’s IRB in the first 180 days, based on the court’s finding of facts, is greater or less than the IRB as prescribed by s.117 of the Act for the subsequent days, is matter of mathematical calculation.
If it is greater, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 117(4) of the Act.
As agreed by counsel, if they are unable to agree on the calculation of the IRB, the matter may be remitted back to me.
If Montgrand is entitled to benefits other than what SGI has paid him, he is awarded interest on the value of those benefits not paid, from June 1, 2001 to date.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts.
The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator.
The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000.
This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident.
The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year.
HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality.
The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment.
The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.
 2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.
There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3)
Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","[8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 86, 88, 85, 84]"

In decision dated February 9, 1996, Justice MacDonald found that the Order of Palmeter, A.C.J. remained valid Order of the Supreme Court.

CASE ON APPEAL
respondents
REASONS FOR","The respondents were granted an order by a Chambers judge pursuant to s. 38(1) of the Bankruptcy Act which authorized them to commence a fraud action against the appellant, a bankrupt.
In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1).
The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant.
The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action.
The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order.
He dismissed the action.

c) There will be an order under s. 47.051 authorizing the taking of bodily substances for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis;
e) There will be an order given the length of sentence that the victim surcharge be waived.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section.
The Crown brought a dangerous offender application.
The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing.
His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions.
The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang.
The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy.
The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang.
He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation.
The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth.
The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary.
While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody.
The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated.
HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code.
The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang.
The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i).
Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently.
The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii).
The accused was declared a dangerous offender.
However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public.
In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated.
The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","[3, 12, 11, 555, 30, 553, 28, 535, 1, 533, 549, 24]"
196,"[1] A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault.
There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction.
[3] At the brief trial, three witnesses, C.J. (who was the alleged victim), police officer and the appellant, testified.
[4] C.J. said that she and the appellant had been in an intimate and drug related relationship beginning in the summer of 2003.
While the appellant was away from the house tending to some roofing work, C.J. decided to drive her daughter and friend home to the city.
As they were preparing to leave by car, the appellant arrived, opened the car door and said words to the effect that C.J. was not going into town without him.
Each of these elements was absent in the Sheppard case.
They make clear that the accused=s evidence was considered not only in light of the question of credibility but also of the ultimate issue of reasonable doubt.
[43] In summary, these reasons, while certainly open to criticism, do not in my view, either disclose an error of law or preclude meaningful appellate review in the particular circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt.
Appeal dismissed;
the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review.
The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt.
It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","[3, 0, 209, 212, 6, 15, 7, 14, 203]"

But the applicant must accept responsibility at least in part for permitting the arrears to accumulate over the two years.

Written Reasons: April 24, 2002
Reasons By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise
Analysis [11] The primary issue before the Court of Queen’s Bench was whether the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the appellant had not complied with the original order of the Board.
The appellant contended that the original order did not include a requirement that it construct washrooms which were accessible to wheelchair reliant members of the public.
[12] The appellants appeal the decision of Matheson J. to this court on essentially the ground that he erred in failing to find that the Board had exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the appellant had not complied with the original order.
[13] We are all of the opinion that Matheson J. did not err in so finding.
The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to the external access of the property or to other “facilities and services” and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine.
[14] In the result the appeal is dismissed with cost on double Column V.

[6](1999), 1999 CanLII 12740 (SK QB), 183 Sask. R. 139 at para.","A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users.
A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant.
The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence.
The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada.
The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision.
During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations.
In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
This was not appealed.
An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order.
The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.
The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services).
The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal.
The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order.
It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance.
The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","[44, 46, 2, 1, 41, 3, 42, 37, 43, 36, 33, 32]"
201,"After x-ray, Dr. Lavoie determined that Hurd had pneumothorax, collapsed lung, which he associated with the events of water-skiing engaged in by Hurd, and he referred him to Dr. S.C. Kanthan at the Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon.
[3] Dr. Kanthan resolved the pneumothorax by performing thoracostomy, procedure whereby tube is placed into the pleural cavity, the chest area where escaped air is collecting.
[4] On August 11, 1997, Dr. Kanthan discharged Hurd from hospital and reported to Dr. Lavoie that the pneumothorax was resolved and that follow-up treatment was not necessary.
1. the objective in construing the policies’ coverage of liability must be to give effect to the policies’ dominant purpose of indemnity;
[28] The final consideration concerns the “effective date” of the policy referred to in the exclusionary clause.
This letter was written after Hurd experienced the pneumothorax and, perhaps more importantly after Wrishko was informed about it.
[29] In summary conclude that MSI insured Hurd for medical services required by him while outside the province of Saskatchewan for the period from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998.
[30] The plaintiff will therefore have judgment for the sum of $26,864.46 prayed for in this action together with costs to be taxed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies.
The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents.
The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan.
He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA.
MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy.
The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary.
They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed.
1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted.
Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery.
2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment.
The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question.
The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998.
It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","[85, 7, 87, 82, 10, 75, 79, 6]"

The facts relevant to the disability claim are, or would be, the applicant’s health commencing at least 120 days after her employment terminated.

[1] This appeal is from decision of Justice Hamilton of the Supreme Court in an assessment of damages arising out of an automobile accident.
The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant’s motor vehicle.
The trial judge described the accident as “a very mild rear end collision.”
[2] At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident in question did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that the accident caused only a mild aggravation of the appellant’s pre-existing, and major, back problem.
[3] The trial judge concluded:
That offer was increased, before trial, to an amount which proved to be in excess of what the appellant ultimately received.
To sustain this cross appeal the respondent must demonstrate that the trial judge’s assessment of general damages at $25,000.00 is “so inordinately high that it must be wholly erroneous estimate of the damage” (see Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ld., 1951 CanLII 374 (UK JCPC), [1951]

It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem.
The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000.
The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded.
The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed.
Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.
No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment.
Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs.
Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","[1, 0, 2, 3, 30, 28, 29, 25, 7, 21, 4, 24]"

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers.
It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest.
At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers.
HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.
 1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a).
What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute.
Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession.
Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession.
S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34.
4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'.
5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease.
Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date.
Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada.
Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.
 6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly.
To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","[4, 553, 2, 550, 537, 535, 539, 557, 536, 544, 560, 562, 23, 545, 22, 559, 21, 565, 563, 61, 566, 58, 9, 547, 55, 0]"

The appeal judge ruled he could not say the trial judge’s conclusion would have been the same if he had first determined, as he ought to have, the payments received by the appellants were in fact income and then ordered new trial.
[4] In our view the appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge.
Thus in our opinion the trial judge properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea.

Again, encourage the mother to proceed with the recommended therapy immediately.","The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006.
The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years.
The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care.
In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions.
The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act.
HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act.
There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
There shall also be an order with respect to access.
It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process.
First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11.
If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children.
The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them.
The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA.
They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children.
The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands.
The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result.
If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act.
The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs.
The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children.
Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive.
Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act.
The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection.
Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care.
Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion.
Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home.
The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities.
Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change.
She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it.
For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act.
The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years.
The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act.
All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother.
However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements.
In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor.
The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old.
There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years.
The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act.
Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives.
An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case.
The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","[738, 25, 29, 43, 17, 22, 718, 1, 744, 47, 10]"
207,"The evidence presented by Mr. Hogeterp on the summary judgment application consisted of his affidavit and two affidavits of Michelle Kelly, one of his lawyers.
[40] In this case the defendant Mr. Hogeterp did not meet the first part of the summary judgment test.
He did not establish that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial, and the application ought therefore to have been dismissed on that basis.
[42] Counsel for the respondents argued that if the appeal were dismissed, they should receive double the normal tariff for interlocutory appeals because they made an offer to settle the appeal.
The offer, dated May 9, 2007, was that if Mr. Hogeterp agreed to dismissal of the appeal, the respondents would waive the costs ordered by the chambers judge and any costs associated with the appeal.
[43] Rule 41A.09(1) provides costs consequences for the failure to accept an offer to settle that is more favourable than that ordered after trial.
The respondents have not pointed to any case determining that Rule 41A.09(1) is applicable to offers to settle appeals.
Furthermore, the offer to settle, involving waiver of costs of the application and those that might be ordered after appeal, was for an insignificant amount in comparison to the amount of money ultimately at issue here.","A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway.
An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway.
The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway.
When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed.
Appeal dismissed.
At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit.
It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit.
Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","[241, 240, 234, 238, 235, 239, 244, 13]"

APPEAL DIVISION
BETWEEN: JAMES DOUGLAS HILTZ
and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: CHIPMAN, J.A. (Orally)","The appellant appealed his conviction for assaulting a police officer engaged in the execution of his duty.
The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person.
Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police.
The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants.
The appellant assaulted the officer.
The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction.
In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding.
Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial,
that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","[5, 1, 64, 67, 9, 66, 0, 68, 70, 12, 69, 10, 63, 13, 14]"

HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG.

 2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration.

He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission.
Judgment for the defendants;
there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway.
Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","[167, 3, 9, 11, 165, 12, 13, 6]"

1. The perspective of the child;
4. Whether the child participates with extended family in the same way as would biological child.
9. The time to determine whether someone stands in the place of parent is when the family is functioning as unit.
[21] Tristen had relationship with both Mr. Hanna’s and Mr. Delorey’s extended family at the time of separation.
[23] Mr. Delorey's time in parenting role with Tristen was relatively lengthy from Tristen's point of view.
That parenting role was diminished before and during the marriage by Ms. Callahan\'s decision to allow Mr. Hanna back into Tristen\'s life.
Mr. Hanna’s involvement with Tristen increased during the Delorey-Callahan marriage.","The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.'
While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year.
The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child.
She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship.
The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife.
The child no longer had contact with the husband.
The child is not a 'child of the marriage.'
The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him.
He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child.
The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on).
Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent.
Such is not the case here.","[149, 1, 2, 4, 3, 11, 5, 144, 6, 147, 20, 146, 25, 17, 16]"

Jim Dallyn On His Own Behalf
Judgment M. F. Martinez,
[1] Jim Dallyn is charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 kilometres per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.
The offence is alleged to have occurred on September 5, 2013, on Highway 55 near Peerless, Saskatchewan.

203(1) No person shall drive vehicle on highway at speed greater than 60 kilometres per hour when passing:

The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.
The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver.
The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses.
The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment.
He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment.
The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment.

[5] The parties have brought before the court the initial question of liability.
[6] Mr. Ziola states that the central issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement.
Such is nature of many misunderstandings.
frame of reference, once established, is not easily altered.
The court finds that Mr. Ziola reasonably believed that by stating his willingness to bring the deposit he was performing the contract of sale respecting the Subject Quarters.
Again, in colloquial language, the two men were simply not on the same page; in legal language there was no consensus ad idem and, therefore, no contract.
Firstly, was there “meeting of the minds”, or consensus ad idem, that was manifest to the reasonable observer.
Thirdly, did the parties make their agreement conditional upon, and subject to, execution of formal document.
[57] Missing from Justice Wilkinson’s list in this action is consensus ad idem manifest to reasonable observer.
Conclusion [58] Mr. Ziola has not established on a balance of probabilities that he and Mr. Petrie were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale respecting the Subject Quarters.","Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages.
The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land.
The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds.
The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow.
The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation.
Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present.
The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action.
The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed.
The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter).
In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters).
The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program.
He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced.
After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders.
They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals.
The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters.
The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000.
At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000.
The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”.
He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters.
He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers.
The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters.
The defendant told him to “hold off”.
The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters.
The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters.
Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid.
The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.
 HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed.
He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract.
In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties.
The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things;
and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","[245, 249, 10, 246, 13, 243, 233, 231, 235, 232, 16]"

In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery.
The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","[64, 0, 10, 17, 11, 69, 59, 60, 51, 63, 50]"

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness.
The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner.
By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother.
The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times.
To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997.
The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth.
The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent.
The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child.
The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent.
The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home.
The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs.
The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care.
The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future.
The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent.
The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner.
The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties.
The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend.
The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction.
After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property.
The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years.
The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.
 The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home.
The value of the home was $360,000.
The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home.
The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties.
After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act.
The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","[1175, 1164, 1177, 15, 1191, 1198, 23, 1192, 13, 1174, 1165, 1196, 9, 20, 1193]"

If damages should be assessed at March 1994
I find that Johnson Seeds knew in January 1994 that Farr was in breach of the contract and this is when damages should be assessed.","The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract.
Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale.
After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy.
The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993.
The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price.
HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action.
1)There was a valid contract between the parties.
Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract.
2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract.
The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone.
There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist.
Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.
The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions.
Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.

The subject proceeding is pursuant to an application by Michelle Niles filed May 30, 2008; as amended on September 8, 2008.
This text at paragraphs 4-24 inclusive essentially repeats the oral ruling.
The remainder of this written decision addresses the second issue.
First Issue: Oral Decision October 2, 2009 [paragraph 4-24 inclusive]
Is the court precluded from ruling on the merits of the Applicant’s claim if he was not child of the marriage at the time the application was filed?
[8] Section (1) defines “child of the marriage” as follows:
child of the marriage” means child of two spouses or former spouses who, at the material time,
In the concluding sentence of paragraph 88 in D.B.S. supra, Justice Bastarache stated:
[69] He disagreed with some expenses for the older child and for which Ms. Niles sought contribution.
3rd year of university 2006/2007 $16,402.80
4th year of university 2007/2008 $21,232.42
[73] In contrast, it is difficult to avoid concluding that Ms. Niles was unsure of her claim.
[74] In the words of Justice Bastarache, Ms. Niles is guilty of “unreasonable delay” in prosecuting her claim.
In addition, s.7 expenses will be calculated on proportionate basis.","The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children.
The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed.
The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed.
His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend.
He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend.
He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain.
The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it.
He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed).
The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier.
She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part).
The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars.
Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application.
The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed.
He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed.
He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend.
While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation.
Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received).
The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years.
While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter.
The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations.
Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","[17, 18, 363, 364, 3, 368, 16, 9, 6, 381, 0, 7, 23, 371, 355]"
224,"[1] The Plaintiffs seek a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother’s financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney.
The Plaintiffs are five of the children of Bessy Marion Wright who died on August 8, 1999, at the age of 86.
From 1992 until her death, Ms. Wright lived with her daughter, Linda Cournoyer, the Defendant.
As well, from 1992 onward, the Defendant’s name was also on Ms. Wright’s bank account.
The bank account was used solely for Ms. Wright’s money, there being no co-mingling of any of Ms. Cournoyer’s money in this account.
Ms. Cournoyer filed an inventory with the Probate Court showing her mother’s assets at the time of her death totalled $56,089.74.
The Plaintiffs expected that there would be assets in excess of $100,000.00.
[9] Section of the Powers of Attorney Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 352 reads as follows:
[10] Accordingly, I am dismissing the Plaintiffs’ action.
Ms. Wright never suffered from any mental incapacity during her life time and therefore Ms. Cournoyer is not required to account to the Plaintiffs for her dealings with her mother’s finances.
The Plaintiffs are jointly and severely liable for payment of these costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney prior to the mother's death.
, plaintiffs' action dismissed; the defendant was not required to account to the plaintiffs for her dealings with her mother's finances.
The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm.
The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","[0, 1, 4, 2, 49, 52, 43, 9, 48, 5, 10]"
225,"[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about February 17, 2006, at Saskatoon, drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene.
In it, he was advised of his eligibility for provisional license, effective July 11, 2005, because he had successfully completed the Driving Without Impairment course.
Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.
In the meantime, it was unfortunate the updated status of the suspension had not been conveyed by S.G.I. in the normal course, any earlier that it actually was.
[17] Therefore, applying the principles in McKenzie supra, while do not necessarily believe the evidence of the accused am left in reasonable doubt by it.
As such the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.
The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification?
HELD: The accused is not guilty.
1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration.
Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2)
The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time.
Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later.
At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief.
Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision.
As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.
Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer.
As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","[0, 1, 66, 65, 64, 63, 5]"

[31] The Applicant is entitled to his costs in the amount of $2,500.00 plus reasonable disbursements to be taxed: J.D.’s estate will pay one half of the costs and disbursements.
The children and grandchildren represented by Mr. Coles will be jointly and severally responsible to pay the other half.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name.
One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will.
the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it.
The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention.
Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception.
In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class.
This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given.
The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","[0, 151, 2, 19, 155, 156, 13, 8, 154, 12, 6, 5, 141]"

Milton J. Veniot, Q.C., solicitor for the plaintiff
There is no dispute as to the motor vehicle accident that resulted in this action.
She was passenger in the Paris vehicle.
She was injured as result of the accident.
She sustained fractures to both of her wrists and broke her left ankle.
The defendant argues that these payments were made on the basis of misinformation provided by the plaintiff’s common law husband, some of which were confirmed by Bertha Langille.
The plaintiff cites Waddams, The Law of Contracts (1984, Canada Law Book) at p. 143:
The plaintiff argues that having failed to do so, it would not be equitable to allow Guardian to enforce its strict legal rights.
do not find that the defendant should be prevented from seeking recovery of monies paid on the basis of what have turned out to be misrepresentation and unprovable assertions.
The plaintiff did not “alter her position to her detriment” by accepting the benefits paid.
This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.
I find that the defendant is entitled to the repayment of those benefits in full.
Costs in favour of the defendant.
Chief Justice Joseph P. Kennedy","The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident.
The defendant was found liable.
At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits.
The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks.
It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid.
The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment.
Ordering the benefits be re-paid,
that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it.
It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff.
This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","[1, 188, 2, 186, 181, 185, 189, 7, 3, 6, 8, 191, 172, 180, 175]"

B-3, as am. by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, S.C. 1992, c. 27, s. 2 and instrument appointed receiver of the Registered Owner on behalf of the HSBC Bank, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the Registered Owner applies for a vesting order with respect to a sale of the real property.
[2] The material satisfies me that the mortgagee, HSBC Bank’s indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the property.
Notice of this application was served upon counsel for the Registered Owner and no opposition on its part has been taken to this application.
No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered Owner’s rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected if the order is granted.
At para. of the judgment the court goes on to observe:
However, under no circumstances should vesting order be made unless or until the rights of all interested parties have either been relinquished or have been extinguished by due process.
[11] The application for the vesting order applied for is granted.","FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order.
The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year.
HELD: The vesting order was granted.
1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so.
In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87.
2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor.
The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price.
The registered owner had taken no opposition.
No other interests will be adversely affected.
3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","[5, 3, 2, 32, 31, 0, 29]"
232,"[4] preliminary inquiry was held before Judge Anne E. Crawford on September 20th, 1994.
During the course of the trial the Crown called Cst. Joseph Thivierge as an expert witness.
[54] In addition, during the course of Mr. Murray’s testimony, he questioned whether the opinion evidence that is being complained of was, in fact, inadmissible.
As indicated, counsel will only be held liable for an error in judgment if it is outside the realm of reasonable, acceptable choices.
[57] In arriving at this decision, have taken into consideration the fact that very experienced trial judge presided over the Plaintiff’s criminal proceeding and he, too, did not raise the issue of the admissibility of the evidence in question.
While this comment is obviously made by party seeking to support the admissibility of the evidence, the fact that the Crown states that it could not seriously be contended that this evidence was inadmissible emphasizes the fact that the question of whether evidence is admissible is often not clear.
He erred, however, in the application of that law to the facts of this case.
That is something that can occur in any trial.
This has been an unfortunate case in many respects and am hopeful that this final issue can be dealt with by consent.
Associate Chief Justice","The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people.
He was charged with dangerous driving.
His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial.
At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment.
The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory.
As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination.
The plaintiff was convicted.
He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won.
Eventually, the charges were dropped.
The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal.
In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence.
They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury.
The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract.
The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions.
Action dismissed.
The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer.
Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result.
Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case.
The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions.
While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","[282, 283, 288, 9, 276, 13, 260, 269, 291, 266]"

Judge: The Honourable Chief Judge John D. Comeau
Written Decision: Friday, September 24, 2004
Counsel: Martin J. Pink, Q.C., for the Applicant
THE ISSUES:
[42] There is some testimony from another family member that the maternal grandmother has and is providing good and adequate care for D.’s brother.
Risks, such as her inability to adequately nurture D., to provide for her materially, to not place her in an environment of risk, etcetera, are evident.”
It is undoubtedly desirable, if it can be accomplished, to keep children of family together, so that they may share the affection and support of each other and grow up with sense of family solidarity.
This does not, however, preclude consideration of future bonding if there is enough contact.
[47] Considering all the evidence before the court, including the two plans of care, there is a bond between the paternal grandmother and the child.
An order will issue under that Act (Maintenance and Custody Act) granting custody to the paternal grandmother who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion.
John D. Comeau
for the Province of Nova Scotia","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access.
Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child.
The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother.
The Agency supported the paternal grandmother.
Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents.
The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.
The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","[142, 0, 5, 13, 151, 6, 3, 141, 127, 149, 148, 132, 138]"

It also involves consideration of request from both counsel for the respondents that the appeal be dismissed with costs to be awarded on solicitor and client basis.

[3] Mr. Saunders had practised law for in excess of forty years before his retirement in the early 1990's.
[5] On September 4, 1998, Mr. Saunders wrote the residuary legatees stating, in part:
Enclosed please find copies of the account and citation.
am confident that there are no errors, but would appreciate your review advice.
Respondents’ Request for Solicitor and Client Costs
[34] With respect to costs on this appeal, it is relevant to consider the matters that gave rise to the appeal.
Mr. Saunders’ actions amounted to serious dereliction of duty which we would class as unconscionable.
As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process.
We would classify the matter before us as one of those rare and exceptional cases in which solicitor and client costs should be ordered.","One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act.
At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.'
The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act.
The executor appealed.
He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.
This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","[0, 3, 96, 90, 10, 11, 95, 6, 13, 84, 4, 91]"

David A. Gerrand Q.C For the Defendant
October 10, 2006
BOGDASAVICH, PCJ JUDGMENT
CLAIM [1] The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.
The defendant is the Reeve of the Council of the R.M. Both the plaintiff and defendant were elected to their positions in November 2004.
(i)deliberate unlawful conduct in the exercise of public functions;
There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant.
The defendant is not liable to the plaintiff pursuant to the tort of misfeasance in public office.
He alleges that the defendant owed him duty of care “to ensure that she had clear and explicit statutory authority for the actions that she took against him”.
While it is clear that the plaintiff and defendant were in a relationship that created a duty of care, I find that because the defendant was acting on the advice of counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff that she has not breached the standard of care.","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.
The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions.
The plaintiff is a councillor.
The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act.
There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council.
The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.
While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council.
The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents.
The dispute between the parties is a political one.
A court should be reluctant to get involved.
2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful.
This requirement has not been met.
The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality.
There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant.
As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff.
3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.
Her actions were not negligent.","[0, 1, 7, 118, 115, 119, 113, 4, 3, 2, 106]"
236,"Ancillary to and dependent upon determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party.
Both parties agreed that the application for dissolution of the marriage proceed pursuant to the counter-petition.
The evidence demonstrated breakdown of the marriage as established by s. 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.).
[4] In December, 1986, [K.O.] and [C.O.] became engaged.
[A.S.O.] was born in […] of that year and the parties married in November.
[46] [C.O.]‘s income is comprised only of the child tax credit, the family income plan supplement and the interim child support that she receives from [K.O.].
Her annual income for the purposes of the Guidelines is below the level at which any child support would be payable by her pursuant to the applicable table.
The result in this case would be that [K.O.] would be obliged to pay to [C.O.] the full table amount.
Accordingly, there will be an order that he pay child support to [C.O.] in the amount of $675 per month commencing February 1, 1999.
As well, [K.O.]‘s employment pension will be divided equally at source in accordance with the provisions of his employee pension plan regarding division on marriage breakdown.","The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support.
Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP.
The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act.
2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.
The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home.
Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children.
3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent.
The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month.
The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable.
Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases.
It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time.
The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable.
There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","[216, 205, 212, 204, 5, 3, 10, 6, 207, 12]"

SECTION 487.05 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE
DECISION FEBRUARY 27, 2002 B. D. HALDERMAN, P. C. J.
FROM THE TRANSCRIPT:
It will take, think, very few moments and then people can come back in.
And, Mr. Parker, as understand, the court has been the courtroom has been cleared.
think this ought to properly proceed in camera and ex parte as in an ordinary warrant application.
[28] THE COURT: But regardless of that side issue, it seems to me the oath is perfectly as valid taken before a commissioner or a notary as it is before me.
So my conclusion as result of having looked at the issue in some detail, before wrote the decision and in light of your submissions this afternoon, the intention is to make the protocol work in as flexible fashion as it can, not impeding the police in their legitimate role but making sure that the Court maintains its independence.
And am of the view that it’s simple matter, for example, in Form 5.01, for me to cross out, “taken before me”.
It’s nevertheless on sworn Information and it’s in accordance with the Code.
And to deal with Informations, except in emergency situations as provided for in that protocol
[30] THE COURT: by way of something that’s been sworn before it gets before the judge","An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form.
The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge.
HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge.
An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.
The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence.
Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code.
Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","[1, 0, 64, 66, 63, 65, 13, 7, 12, 4, 11, 59, 62]"

THAT you, the said VITERRA INC. on or about the 8th day of September, A.D. 2011, at workplace at or near Rosetown, Saskatchewan, did fail to ensure that the health and safety at work of every person employed by it, namely Paul Cruse, was protected, by failing to instruct Paul Cruse on how to unplug blockage inside receiving pit of grain elevator in manner that provided for his health and safety directly resulting in Paul Cruse’s death contrary to s. 124 of the Canada Labour Code and thereby committing an offence contrary to subsection 148(2) of the Canada Labour Code.
6. THAT you, the said VITERRA INC. on or about the 8th day of September, A.D. 2011, at workplace at or near Rosetown, Saskatchewan, did fail to ensure that employee Paul Cruse was made aware of every known or foreseeable health or safety hazard, namely the hazard of being engulfed by free flowing granular material in particular the contents of receiving pit at grain elevator, as required by paragraph 125(1)(s) of the Canada Labour Code thereby committing an offence contrary to subsection 148(1) of the Canada Labour Code.
[75] Accordingly, the defence of due diligence would apply with respect to each count if the actus reus had been established with respect to it.","HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee.
The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies.
The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner.
The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit.
The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him.
The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures.
The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown.
The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally.
The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business.
The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety.
The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task.
The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2.
The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4.
The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain.
The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved.
The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","[9, 4, 263]"
239,"J. Walter Thompson, Q.C., for the Respondent
[1] This application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005.
[2] The parties were married in Halifax on the 21st day of November, 1980, and began living separate and apart on August 3, 1993.
[3] The parties had four children, Gillian, born May 6, 1981; Sheena, born October 31, 1982; Logan, born October 31, 1985; and Tessa, born April 8, 1987.
The children remained with their mother in her custody at the date of separation.
She started working in Edinburgh, once she left university.
In September, 2001, she attended Northumberland College in Halifax for this massage therapy course and left the program in 2002.
The Respondent can supplement her income through employment.
[107] In January, 2007 to December, 2007, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month.
[110] The father will continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses according to their current schedule.
[111] The third party payments for her car shall, in accordance with the allowable tax law, be considered third party payments by way of support.
[113] Counsel for the Applicant shall draft the order.
Legere Sers, J.
Halifax, Nova Scotia","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce.
The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support.
Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education.
After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments.
The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home.
Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work.
The father now applied to terminate spousal support.
The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses.
Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","[3, 351, 353, 0, 340, 350, 341, 23, 348, 7, 6, 347, 32, 2]"
240,"[2] Steven and Jody Johansson were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson.
The accident occurred on October 25, 1998.
[3] Both Steven and Jody Johansson were paid damages for the injuries they sustained.
The amount paid to each of the plaintiffs was acknowledged in writing and they each signed a release acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident.
The plaintiffs now claim damages for the injuries they sustained as a result of the accident which they allege was caused by the careless and negligent actions of GMCL in the design and manufacture of the vehicle involved.
To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of this Court’s process.
Conclusion [20] As between the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, and the defendant, GMCL, there are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial.
GMCL has passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim has real chance of success.
They have failed to do so.
[21] The parties are encouraged to try to reach agreement on costs failing which they are invited to file written submissions within 30 calendar days of the date of release of this decision.","The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson.
They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel').
More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages.
GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases.
They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party.
Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed.
There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson.
The releases were clear and unambiguous.
Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident.
They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel.
While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'.
Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general.
GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs.
To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","[66, 68, 1, 2, 69, 3, 4, 65, 71, 9]"

HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw.
The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor.
It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry.
There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest.
Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open.
The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment.
The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion.
5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside.
The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership.
They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation.

NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 2009 NSCA 44
Appellant Respondent on cross-appeal
It sought declaration to this effect from the Nova Scotia Supreme Court.
The CBRM now appeals to this court.
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence;
(b) it is false, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;
[83] Nor, by this interpretation, would the court be abdicating its responsibility.
Courts should never shy away from protecting the Constitution simply because issues of public policy may be involved.
Charter rights and freedoms, on this reading, would offer rights without remedy.
Yet this is something the CBRM would have to establish if this matter were to proceed further.
In the circumstances, need not consider the Attorney General’s cross-appeal.","The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972).
At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities.
Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect.
The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36.
The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed.
Appeal dismissed.
The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim.
The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application).
Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck.
While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities.
Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced.
On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","[4, 11, 15, 563, 0, 24, 20, 565, 14, 577, 584, 60, 18, 61, 590, 17, 38, 41]"

When Elmer Schmidt, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway, he applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car.
Consequently, Schmidt brings this action against the car\'s owner, Vernon Henry, and Margaret Henry for his $500.00 deductible, and the Henrys counterclaim for the same.
2. The situation at this intersection is somewhat unusual, in that the stop sign is 39 feet back from the edge of the pavement, which itself approximately two feet from the driving portion of the highway.
Henry complied with the requirement to stop.
However, The Highway Traffic Act places an additional duty upon such drivers.
Section 40 of the Act reads, in part:

The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident.
Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles.
HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50.
The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs.
Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff.
The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

246,"[2] As ground of appeal, the appellant asserts palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of witness (that an amount was owing by the appellant to the respondent) but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent.
There is no issue taken about that part of the judgment.
[5] As to the issue under appeal, in his judgment the trial judge referred to the appellant’s evidence of loaning the respondent $1,900.00 in 2003 for the purpose of funding repairs to the respondent’s car.
She stated that Pierre asked Wally when he was going to pay him back the $1,900.00 and Wally said “I have bills for you too, why don’t you come into town and we’ll discuss it?”
[8] In my view, the trial judge preferred the respondent’s denial of the alleged debt to the witness’s testimony on that point.
That principle of law and case authorities were not before the trial judge nor argued on this appeal.
[9] am not persuaded that the judgment is not reasonably supported by the evidence.
[11] There is no order as to costs.","This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.
The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant.
The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","[22, 25, 17, 21, 4, 1, 5, 7]"
247,"[1] In January of 1993 Ronald Compain (""Mr. Compain"") sustained severe injuries in an automobile accident.
After the weekly SGI disability benefits were terminated, the Bank Loans fell into default.
The Royal Bank reported the particulars of these loan defaults to Equifax Canada (""Equifax""), credit reporting agency.
The Royal Bank requested a written assignment of those settlement proceeds, however, Mr. Compain declined to give an assignment.
The accounts were in the hands of both the Royal Bank's internal collection department and referred to its external solicitors for collection.
[27] There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business.
It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon the Equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report.
[29] find that the Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to Mr. Compain and its general banking practices including its report to Equifax as credit reporting agency.
[31] As final comment it should be noted that consistent with the finding in this judgment that the Royal Bank has throughout acted in good faith and in keeping with its contractual and fiduciary obligations towards Mr. Compain it is expected that the Royal Bank will now proceed to request Equifax to place upon Mr. Compain's credit report as appropriate commentary in the spirit of that proposed in its counsel's letter to Mr. Compain's solicitors April 24, 1997.","In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded.
The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated.
The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax).
The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans.
The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement.
The bank commenced this action for payment.
The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract.
HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims.
The bank's claim was admitted at trial.
1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement.
The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate.
Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case.
3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","[83, 8, 0, 78, 81, 80, 6, 5, 86]"

[73] The benefit conferred by the Plaintiff to the Defendant falls within the third requirement.

The Defendant is of the opinion this award should not be great.
You also have to consider the expertise of Mr. Walters.
[78] All of the land has not been sold but the Plaintiff's services have enriched same as well as it enriched the land already sold.
[79] When one considers the Defendant purchased this land for somewhat over $200,000.00 for which he has already received $875,000.00 with three valuable lots remaining, it can be seen the Plaintiff's work greatly enriched its value.

encourage the parties to settle the issue of costs, otherwise ask they each submit short briefs after which will make determination.","The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land.
The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract.
Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done.
Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable.
An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","[3, 445, 4, 446, 451, 450, 18, 428, 429, 8, 2, 425, 438]"

The respondent shall then parent continuously until the recommencement of school, at which point, the parties shall revert to the regular parenting schedule.
Within 14 days thereafter, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent the sum of $36,850.00, representing her interest in the equity therein.

(h) party’s denial of or refusal to admit anything that should have been admitted;

11-20 If the Court awards costs as between solicitor and client, the judge awarding those costs shall assess them.
[419] While successful party is presumptively entitled to the same in family law proceeding, costs remain in the discretion of the court.","HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband.
The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father.
It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other.
The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him.
There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse.
Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy.
2) The husband had professional corporation.
His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received.
His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings.
Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability.
The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses.
It was not appropriate to impute income to her.
She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada.
Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order.
There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support.
3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon.
The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife.
Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names.
The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations.
The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home.
4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support.
The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career.
The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support.
However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate.
The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support.
5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","[1547, 1544, 1535, 1539, 1525, 1534, 1518, 1526, 1543, 52, 1522, 56, 1488, 1512]"

This misunderstanding does not affect the fact that once she was dismissed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff had an obligation to record accurate working hours in the Record of Employment for Lilia.
[48] If she is not able to obtain the payments that she had lost, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Lilia.
[49] As there was mixed success by all parties, no costs are awarded.
[50] Dated this 11th day of December, 2013.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff.
The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000.
There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation.
The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim.
The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift.
The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven;
there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent.
The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out.
The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim.
The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement.
The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s.
The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.
The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance.
The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","[133, 129, 10, 124, 7, 8, 11, 126, 135, 114, 134]"

J.A.: This is an appeal by Deborah Lynn Irving, from the granting of, uncontested, divorce and corollary relief judgments.
The appellant asks this Court to set aside the judgments on the basis that the underlying separation agreement is ""unconscionable and unduly harsh.""
In this regard she has applied to the court to admit fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce.
She had first consulted Dr. Gray in January 1995, on referral from her family doctor, and has been on an antidepressant since then.
The appellant says that she feared his violent temper.
During this separation the appellant was involved with her current common law partner, but had sexual relations with the respondent, allegedly under pressure from him.
On November the respondent gave the appellant the separation agreement which had been drafted by his lawyer.
Indeed, the lawyer recommended that the appellant have her review the agreement before signing.
If the judgment or order has not been passed and entered, it may be set aside on motion, unless from the nature of the ground on which the application is made conflicting evidence will have to be considered or viva voce evidence and cross-examination is essential ....

Appearing: Mr. T. Healey For the Crown
JUDGMENT B. MORGAN,
[1] Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, Ms. Neigel was charged with one count of impaired driving, and one count of driving “over .08”, as the charges are more formally particularized in the Information.
The officers had been advised that, on occasion, there were compliance issues respecting “cut off” at the local bar, so they decided to drop in while on routine patrol.
The officers gave friendly warning to the individuals not to drive when they left the bar, and exited the establishment.
Cst. Stanton noted that all four doors of the vehicle were opened.
[4] Cst. Holmstrom estimated the officers were approximately 100 metres away when they first observed the vehicle being started.
[29] In short, the defence evidence lacks reliability.
1) at the time the individuals got into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel;
4) keys were in fact in the vehicle, and it was running, as the police came to the driver’s side door;
5) Ms. Neigel’s blood alcohol level exceeded the permitted amount (count 2).
[31] I find Ms. Neigel guilty on count 2, the “over .08”, as particularized in the Information.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.
08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop.
The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time.
The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar.
The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up.
The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle.
The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle.
The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count.
The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date.
The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability.
The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward.
The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door.
The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","[130, 127, 14, 11, 133, 5, 2, 131, 121, 3, 22, 6, 19]"
254,"[1] SaskTel brings an application seeking an order striking the defendant’s Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of The Queen’s Bench Rules on the basis that under Rule 7-9(2)(a) the Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs.
[2] Sheldon Schutte filed claim on July 23, 2014 against SaskTel.
The Statement of Claim contains the following information:
4. Set out each remedy sought and indicate against which defendants that remedy is sought:

2. What is the specific time frame for the events referred to in Paragraph above?
3. What is the nature of the legal remedy you are claiming?

19 The power to strike out claims that have no reasonable prospect of success is valuable housekeeping measure essential to effective and fair litigation.
It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim.
CONCLUSION [8] Having reviewed the pleadings carefully, I conclude that Mr. Schutte’s claims against SaskTel have no reasonable prospect of success and should be struck.
SaskTel is awarded its costs.","Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Application to Strike

255,"[1] Rocky Dean Elphinstone (Rocky) applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted on October 14, 2004.
His application was prompted by the relocation of Shauna Sharon Petersen (Shauna) on March 3, 2006, with one of the couple’s two children, Tyson Elphinstone (Tyson), from the Kindersley district in northwestern Saskatchewan to the Archerwill district in northeastern Saskatchewan.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Tyson Elphinstone born August 25, 1999 (6 years old).
The parties separated on May 12, 2004, when Shauna left the family home with the two children.
Shauna, her fiancé, Lee Etsell, with whom she was then living, and the children then moved to Coleville.
Kailey has made her choice and her parents have accepted her decision.
[36] Counsel for the parties have agreed upon an access arrangement pending the rendering of this judgment.
Outstanding family property issues may have to be dealt with at pre-trial conference.
[37] There shall be an order as follows:
4. The petitioner, Shauna Sharon Petersen, shall be permitted to relocate Tyson to the Archerwill district.
5. Access and child support issues may be returned to me for orders or directions at the request of either party.
6. Each parent shall keep the other provided with health, educational progress and extracurricular activity information relating to the child in that parent’s home.","The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004.
His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson.
The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent.
This also requires a change in access arrangements.
These are changes in circumstances that are material.
 2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson.
The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey.
After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child.
Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis.
Even telephone access has been sporadic.
Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3)
The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation.
The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support.
4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson.
It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to.
The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver.
The petitioner is the psychological parent.","[187, 12, 7, 188, 8, 181, 177, 0, 182, 186, 3, 176, 1]"
256,"[1] This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff’s claim in defamation.
173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that:
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be:
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly or may grant such order as may be just.
Unless otherwise directed, the offending party shall pay double the costs to which the other party would otherwise be entitled.
The grounds in support of the application, as set out in the notice of motion, are these:
1. The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.
The facts as pleaded would not constitute defamation in law even if proven to be true.
The Plaintiff fails to plead any facts as to the dates on which these statements were supposed to have been made, and deprives the Plaintiff of the ability to address the applicable limitation period.
It follows that this submission must be rejected.
[13] In the result, the application is dismissed.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation pursuant to rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The court declined to strike the claim.
1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, all essential elements of a claim in defamation are set out.
A reasonable cause of action is disclosed.
2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made.
Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","[0, 5, 78, 77, 4, 8, 14, 11, 10, 9, 17]"
257,"Disposition: Appeal allowed
[1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management.
The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.
In 2001, she filed grievance that was resolved in her favour.
[92] In defamation action, the court can only consider whether defence exists after finding that the plaintiff has been defamed.
That does not mean that a trial judge in such circumstances could not decline to order costs to a successful defendant, but it is not appropriate to decline to do so on the basis of “mixed results.”
[93] The appeal is allowed with costs to Dr. Rubin in this Court and in the Court of Queen’s Bench.
Since I have allowed the appeal, the cross-appeal is dismissed, but given that the Respondents are clearly correct with respect to the issue raised in the cross-appeal, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to dismiss it without costs.
concur “Lane J.A.”","The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249).
The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.
The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000.
The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000.
The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied.
Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion.
In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice.
It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal.
The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege.
The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000.
It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law.
The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case.
The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer.
The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed.
The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant.
An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice.
The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs.
However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","[451, 458, 8, 9, 0, 465, 460, 29, 455]"

COUNSEL: Kevin A. Burke, Q.C., Defence Counsel
Respondent REASONS FOR","The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs.
He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights.
Dismissing the appeal,
that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","[77, 3, 4, 84, 72, 1, 66, 7, 78, 11, 71, 63, 8, 65, 18, 62]"
259,"Background [1] The accused stands charged that on or about the 16th day of July 2001, at Manitou Beach, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did ... ""while her ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(a) and section 255(1) of the Criminal Code And having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in her blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code.""
[2] The matter came on for trial before me on February 24, 2003, in Watrous, Saskatchewan.
[3] At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analyses, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights.
[7] The Crown called RCMP Constable Zambak as its only witness.
useful review in regard to this issue can be found in R. v. McDarby [1998]
[33] Accordingly, there being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused.
[34] The court will now entertain submissions from Crown and defence as to the resumption of the trial in regard to the first count of impaired driving.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand.
HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted.
There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.
 1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'.
The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand.
2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made.
The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case.
The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.
The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","[69, 70, 0, 1, 7, 66, 2]"
260,"The transcript from the small claims trial was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act, 1997, SS 1997, S-50.11
The appellant, however, says it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed.
[3] small claims trial was conducted before Judge Kovatch.
decision was rendered on April 30, 2015 and certified judgment on May 28, 2015.
The appellant, Saskatchewan Government Insurance [SGI], then served and filed notice of appeal on June 26, 2015.
That letter is not copied to either the appellant or the respondent.
This discretionary remedy is set forth in ss. 39(9).
This is part of s. 39 and therefore must refer both to the absence of transcript and the failure to file within the six month provision, through no fault of the appellant.
In that case, the court may make “any other order that the judge considers appropriate.”
However, this occurred through no fault of the appellant and accordingly the right of appeal should be preserved to allow the matter to be heard on its merits.
The setting of the appeal date is confirmed.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed.
The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act.
The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed.
In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","[137, 6, 129, 7, 139, 2, 8, 9, 126, 16, 128]"

The appellant/plaintiff was aware that the date on the summons was August 6.
But he appeared in accordance with the particulars of a note previously given to him by court staff indicating that the trial of his claim would take place on August 7, 1998.
It appears the misunderstanding occurred because the date and court room number were inverted on the note.
defendant in the circumstances should consent to an order directing new trial so that the claim can be presented and its merits determined by the court.
plaintiff in such circumstances has no recourse but to appeal to this court and incur the attendant expense to obtain the relief to which he is entitled.

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD:
The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability.
The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court.
The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial.
According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence.
The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","[139, 137, 3, 8, 136, 9, 14, 16, 0, 12, 129]"

He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000.
Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university.
There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service.
Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","[0, 1, 118, 114, 110, 111, 3, 115, 116, 6, 10, 9, 109, 107, 100]"

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice.

HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child.
The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support.
He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income.
1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment.
There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.
 2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'.
That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines.
The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning.
The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a).
The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","[252, 10, 6, 249, 11, 7, 243, 14, 0]"

The plaintiff (Sign‑O‑Lite) is in the business of manufacturing, selling and leasing commercial signs and has construction facility in Toronto, Ontario.
The defendant (MacKay) is the President and one of the principal shareholders of Nova.
In April of 1986, Nova made inquiries to the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation for regulatory approval to erect sign between Nova's building and Highway 102.
This project was abandoned as Nova learned that the 6' 15' sign was not strong enough to act as free‑standing sign.
In October of 1986, Nova was contacted by one Byard Thurber who was the Atlantic Sales Manager of the plaintiff to discuss whether it was interested in sign.

DECISION Palmeter, A.C.J., S.C.","The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment.
The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant.
The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign.
The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert.
Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed.
The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse.
Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim,
that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement.
Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void.
The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental.

as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","[3, 6, 7, 165, 162, 164, 15, 2, 13, 157, 9, 1, 161, 159, 145, 17]"

1. The trial judge made several errors in law and failures in judgement in rendering his decision in finding of guilty; in upholding this decision of the trial judge, the learned Supreme Court Justice also has erred in law in the same manner:
d.) The trial judge erred in law by not considering the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" on the basis of the evidence adduced and its application thereof.
e.) The Crown Attorney wilfully withheld exculpatory evidence from the learned trial judge, contrary to his sworn duty to present all the relevant evidence in the interests of justice.
5. The learned Supreme Court Justice erred in law by failing to properly apply all the elemental standards, re: s. 264, as established in the relevant case law.
Both the complainant’s sister and Serge Aucoin, friend of Mr. Shrubsall, were present.
All four witnesses testified about the confrontation.

(c) the notice contained the minimum requirements of s. 23(1) namely, signed with the premises identified and the date set out upon which the termination is effective.
There is written rental agreement, but the evidence would indicate that it was signed by only one tenant and not by the Landlord.
The statutory conditions set out in s. 20 of the Act were not included in the rental agreement.

There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay.
The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced.
In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials.
In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided.

This is an appeal by the Crown against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender, as a result of his having committed two armed robberies.
concurrently with the remainder of two year term of
closed custody earlier imposed upon the respondent.
The Crown appealed on the ground the two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the earlier term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the requirements of deterrence, and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice.
The respondent,

The respondent has an extensive record of property-
related and other offenses, including failures to comply
These latest offenses demonstrate, first, that he has
profited little from earlier dispositions and, second, that
The weight of the law has now to fall on him more heavily
if it is going to achieve its objectives.
The appeal will therefore be allowed to the extent sought by the Crown.
The two terms of one year each will not only be served consecutively, the one to follow the other, but consecutive to the term earlier imposed.
In the result, the respondent will have to serve out the time remaining in respect of the earlier disposition, then serve two more years in secure custody in consequence of these armed robberies.","A young offender was sentenced to 1 year closed custody on each of 2 armed robberies, the sentences to be consecutive to each other, but both being concurrent to the remainder of a sentence of 2 years closed custody which was already being served with respect to previous unrelated convictions when the accused escaped and committed the robberies.

Written Reasons: August 2, 2005
By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Richards
[1] This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2 (“PPSA”).
If that issue is decided in Gari’s favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by Gari against the Credit Union.
[3] Gari leased vacant lot (“the Property”) in Nipawin to Lakeland Leisure Products Ltd. In 1997, Lakeland placed large metal quonset (“the Building”) on the Property.
The Credit Union also registered fixture filing notice with the Prince Albert Land Titles Office.
The letter indicated that Gari, pursuant to ss. 36(10) and (11) of the PPSA, claimed reimbursement for damages expected to be caused by the removal of the Building.
[8] The Credit Union then served second notice pursuant to s. 36 of the PPSA.
[47] In argument, counsel for Gari also suggested that figure of $500 per month could be used to approximate storage costs.
[52] In its cross-appeal, Gari argues that the trial judge erred in failing to award damages in the amount of $500 per month in respect of “rent”.
[53] have substantial doubts about the theory of damages expressed in the cross-appeal.
The cross-appeal necessarily fails because there was no landlord-tenant relationship between Gari and the Credit Union.
concur BAYDA C.J.S.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA).
The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union.
The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest.
The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent.
The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
Cross appeal dismissed.
In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.
 1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures.
It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other.
There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so.
2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it.
Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA.
3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them.
The respondent's claims in this regard fail.
4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief.
As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument.
5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","[0, 12, 2, 16, 7, 222, 232, 3, 217, 220, 13, 29, 199, 23]"
275,"NATURE OF THE APPEAL
[2] The Notice of Appeal lists six grounds of appeal, all of which can be summarized as follows:
In the circumstances, the appeal against the acquittal on the charge of impaired driving is dismissed and this appeal will proceed on the basis that the Crown seeks to overturn the acquittal on the charge of driving while over .08.
The accused was driving on Highway #22 near Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, on October 27, 2007, around 9:50 p.m.
11 The officer suspected that the pickup truck, in doing full U-turn near the intersection, was trying to evade the approaching police vehicle.
The officer then asked for his driver’s licence and registration, at which point the accused turned to return to his vehicle, stumbled and losing his balance fell shoulder first into his own truck.
The accused was noted by the officer as taking about three minutes to locate his photo identification.
The officer arrested the accused for impaired driving at 9:53 p.m. while he was inside his truck.
In this case, since the learned trial judge has retired, elect to have this Court impose sentence.
In the event that sentencing hearing has not been held or commenced within 90 days, bench warrant will issue for the arrest of Mr. Knoedler in order to compel his attendance before this Court.","The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08.
The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights.
During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence.
HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered.
The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter.
The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand.
The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case.
The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","[3, 259, 17, 0, 27, 263, 23, 24, 12, 6]"
276,"Mr. Chu submits that the trial judge should have granted an adjournment to permit proper assessment of the late-disclosed documents.
[3] Mr. Chu submits that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to miscarriage of justice.
[79] In O’Connor, L’Heureux-Dubé J. analyzed the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the jurisprudence “favoured maintaining distinction between the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process”.
Justice L’Heureux-Dubé found at paragraph 60 that individual rights to trial fairness and the general reputation of the criminal justice system were fundamental concerns that underlie both the common law doctrine of abuse of process and the Charter.
[81] Insofar as this second “abuse of process” path remains open where breach of s. is not found, it may be another path permitting the review of discretionary decision as the Court in Davis recognized.
recognize that the articulation of second path is somewhat circuitous in that the law underlying an adjournment decision and the impact on trial fairness are both captured by the same underlying facts.

[1] An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed in 1999 CanLII 638 (SCC), [1999]
SCR 759, but the Supreme Court did not comment on the disclosure issue or the comments of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal with respect to that issue.","HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered.
The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin.
He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose.
The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown.
In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations.
The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","[471, 472, 10, 461, 12, 462, 469, 456, 457]"
277,"[1] Very few charges laid by the Crown are declared to be void ab initio.
Procedural Background
1.) The Crown did [sic] prove their case of sunscreen being present.
2.) The Offence Notice issued on January 25, 2008 failed to describe the location of the alleged offence.
... it is no longer possible to say that defective information is automatically nullity disclosing no offence known to law.
[30] Here, unfortunately, the Crown did not allege the proper statute (The Traffic Safety Act) or the correct section number (ss. 113 and 275 of The Traffic Safety Act).
[32] Looking at s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations, 1987, on its own, does not provide the accused with fair notice of the charge that he faces or the penalty that he faces for the contravention.
[33] Accordingly, the charge is nullity and is void ab initio.
The appeal is allowed, and the conviction is quashed.
[34] It should also be noted that the certificate of offence provided voluntary payment of $105.00.
There does not appear to be the legislative authority for the utilization of voluntary payment for an alleged violation of operating motor vehicle on public highway which has after‑market tinted side windows regardless of the way the charge was framed.","The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle.
He appealed on other grounds.
The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion.
The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations.
HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established.
Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty.
The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations.
The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio.
The conviction was quashed.","[1, 101, 98, 95, 97, 103, 100, 5, 90, 10, 9]"

The appellant is entitled to a new trial.","The accused was acquitted on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs and while his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood when questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the copy of the certificate of analysis.
HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'.
It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy.
2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.
This is an error of law.
A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.
Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute.
3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","[120, 115, 5, 121, 117, 1, 7, 118, 122, 110, 4, 10, 11, 111, 107, 109, 114, 9, 8, 13, 104, 106, 16, 14, 12]"
279,"1) The issue is the interpretation of consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement.
3) The disputed portion of the consent judgment of November 6, 2011, (which is simply reflection of the agreement reached on the morning of trial) states this:
(i) The Petitioner shall make an equalization payment of One Hundred and Five Thousand ($105,000.00)
4) The dispute arises because the wife says she is entitled to $105,000 net (in cash or cash equivalents) with at least $65,000 being the cash composition.
She says this is what the husband said he could borrow.
He denies that he ever offered to pay $65,000 in cash.
He does acknowledge that he made formal offer of settlement on October 18, 2011 in the amount of $65,000 cash, and that he was able to obtain financing from the Bank of Montreal at that time.
The petitioner shall have judgment as against the respondent in this amount.
33) These principles are engrained in family property law.
The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal.
The cash balance required to satisfy the judgment is therefore $21,248.85.
direct this be done within 14 days.
36) In light of the mixed success, there will be no order as to costs.","The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered.
The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds.
The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax.
Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000.
The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value.
The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application.
The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs.
Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","[0, 3, 4, 6, 134, 7, 129, 10, 125, 11, 128, 135, 139]"
280,"[1] This is an Application for an Order removing Joan McGean as one of the Personal representatives of the Estate of David Raphael McGean.
[3] The intestate, was employed by Marine Atlantic Inc. for approximately thirty-one (31) years.
During that period he contributed to pension plan, which was valued following his death in June, 2007 by Marine Atlantic Inc. at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00).
As such, the Applicants believe that the Estate should commence an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Marine Atlantic Inc. and the Respondent for payment into the Estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the Intestate, and for reimbursement by the Respondent of the amounts already paid to her.
[5] The Applicants further contend that the Respondent is in position of direct conflict.
Then the Estate could pursue claim for payment of the Marine Atlantic pension into the Estate.
The Intestate had no common law spouse.
They now bind his Estate.
There is no reason to remove Joan McGean as personal representative of the Estate because there is no feasible action for the Estate to pursue.
Joan McGean is entitled to costs for the second day but these are offset by the expense she caused the Applicants on the first date.
The parties therefore will each bear their respective costs.
Order accordingly.","The intestate's biological child, who was one of the personal representatives of the estate, wished to sue the intestate's former employer to have the pension to which he was entitled at the time of his death paid into the estate.
The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action.
The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate.
Application dismissed;
the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.
The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","[0, 4, 62, 61, 14, 60, 55, 10, 9, 54, 19, 5]"

[1] This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cathy Hawes and Aulden Pottie, for damages suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on November 23, 1998 at the intersections of Forrest Hills Drive and Main Street in the Dartmouth area of Halifax Regional Municipality.
The plaintiffs allege that the accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant, Peter Yorston, in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle referred to herein as the “police vehicle”.
The other vehicle was operated by Craig Borgal.
Cathy Hawes testified that she had White Russian and took few sips but the glass in which the liquor was contained was knocked over.
He had completed police call in Cherry Brook and approached the intersection travelling in direction opposite to the direction the Hawes vehicle was travelling.
There is no dispute the police vehicle turned left in front of the Hawes vehicle before the vehicles collided.
[6] The plaintiffs claim the accident was caused solely through the negligence of Mr. Yorston for turning left in front of the Hawes vehicle.
[99] The plaintiff, Cathy Hawes, will recover her costs from the defendants.
The defendants will recover 20% of their costs in one bill from the plaintiff, Aulden Pottie.","The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night.
Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation.
The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand.
She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back.
The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg.
He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy.
General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt).
The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it.
The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","[5, 4, 440, 0, 442, 10, 24, 14, 23, 25]"
282,"[1] This action raises issues about matrimonial property and especially the matrimonial home.

It was, prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties, the long term family home of Sharon Lang and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage.
[6] Sharon Lang is 51 and has, now that her family duties allow it, sought to improve her economic prospects.
She has obtained grade 12 equivalency and is engaged in training as teacher’s assistant at SIAST.
[12] have considered and rejected arguments that involved calculation of the precise value of the personal properties because the evidence had was not reliable and there was an appearance of equality as noted above.
Both parties had the benefit of the matrimonial home during the marriage.
[13] It is to the credit of Edward that at trial he conceded that his claim for 50% of the equity was perhaps unfair (i.e. inequitable) and that 25% would do.
I therefore direct that there shall be judgment in favour of Sharon Lang for $1,945.00 plus an award of costs of $5,000.00 for a total of $6,945.00.","Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue.
The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months.
HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000.
The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances.
However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case.
The home was to remain in the petitioner's name.
It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage.
Five of those children still lived with her in the home.
The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage.
2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed.
One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax.
The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","[0, 5, 38, 41, 11, 6, 34, 37, 12]"

$3,000.00 fine was imposed as sentence.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Westfair has appealed its conviction on the following grounds:
The learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case;
[27] The trial judge concluded that the appellant did not establish the defence of due diligence.
[28] In order to resolve this issue, the trial judge was required to consider what reasonable person would have done in these circumstances to avoid this offence.
reasonable person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence.
Instead, in establishing the defence of due diligence for strict liability offence, an accused must show that he took all reasonable steps to avoid the offence.
This burden is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance.
They mean high standard of awareness and decisive, prompt and continuing action.
To demand more, would, in my view, move strict liability offence dangerously close to one of absolute liability.","The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act.
The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.
 1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place.
2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence.
The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes.
This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person.
By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.
Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","[2, 7, 8, 3, 113, 107, 104, 116, 117, 105, 100, 0]"

His continuous service with Sears was almost 20 years and his total period of employment was 28 years.
It was also necessary to pick up goods that were being returned or exchanged by the customers and return them to the Sears warehouse.
He also testified that Sears operated on two percent profit margin and, therefore, if an employee claimed $20.00 of overtime, it was necessary for Sears to have $1,000.00 in sales to recover the overtime.
He also testified that Sears has 50,000 employees in Canada, and if every employee disregarded the overtime policies, the impact on the compay would be devastating.

TRIAL DIVISION
BETWEEN: CHARLES TAYLOR","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal.
The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers.
The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'.
The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant.
For the defendant,
that the dismissal was justified.
The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","[5, 0, 1, 2, 190, 12, 188, 189, 184, 191, 169, 180, 168]"
286,"Counsel: B. William Piercey, Q.C., counsel for the applicant, Richard Hand
[1] Mr. Richard Hand applied for an order that he has one-half interest in condominium held jointly by his parents until the death of his mother.
However, by the time the application was heard, Mr. Hand allowed that title passed to the survivor and he contended that his parents made mutual wills supported by an implied promise against revocation, which promise his father breached by making will in favour of his sister after the death of his mother.
That was resolved, but it was resolved only as the hearing began.
Was Dr. Hand required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son?
The application was not ""estate litigation"".
[15] have therefore determined not to award costs against the estate in favour of Richard Hand.
[16] The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of the successful party in the actual case.
Considering all of the circumstances, the representatives of the estate should be entitled to recover their solicitor and client costs from the estate.","A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death.
His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death.
Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate.
In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister.
The parties will bear their own costs.
There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs.
Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded.
As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here.
The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid.
The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation?
In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","[0, 58, 3, 55, 7, 52, 54, 4, 51]"
287,"Counsel: Harvey M. MacPhee, for the plaintiffs
By the Court (Orally):
[1] The applicant, Mr. Kenneth McLellan, was injured in single motor vehicle accident shortly after midnight on November 26, 1998, while riding in vehicle operated by one defendant, Ms. Tina Louise Shea.
Counsel for the Applicants advises that he had not been made aware of the death of Marion McLellan until the hearing of this application.
He indicated he needs to further consider the effect of her death on the action before taking any steps in response to this information.
He concluded that the judge hearing the matter must review the relevant facts to assess whether or not the party who served the notice should be deprived of his or her prima facie right to jury trial (at para. 8).
[28] Counsel for Dr. Malik advises that an expert report from an economist will be presented at trial in support of his client’s position.
This will add to the complexity but have no basis to determine that this report will add substantially to the complexity of the evidence.
To do justice to all of the parties, including those other than Mr. McLellan and Dr. Malik, find that there are not sufficiently cogent reasons to set aside the jury in this case.","The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff.
Application dismissed;
the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied.
Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","[139, 9, 136, 0, 3, 4, 135, 20, 10]"
288,"OVERVIEW [1] The plaintiff says that his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made intentionally and maliciously by the defendants.
Dr. Rubin claims these statements were publicly communicated by the defendants by means of notices posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff’s workplace, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 1975 (“CUPE”) and by means of posting on the CUPE website.
The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.
The VTH is staffed with university faculty specialist veterinarians, veterinarian interns and students, and associated staff, including technicians, receptionists and clerks.
“[T]he amount of damages should be governed or graduated by the degree of malice by which defendant was actuated.
Any evidence of express malice may be weighed against the defendant.
Nor would have ordered special damages based on the evidence.
[107] Counsel for the defendants urge only nominal damages.
[109] am not satisfied that the level of insult and level of loss of reputation in this particular case are consistent with the sizable damage awards urged by plaintiff’s counsel.
COSTS [111] I have found that Dr. Rubin indeed was defamed.
However, the defendants have successfully raised the defence of qualified privilege.","The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants.
He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process.
The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college.
He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website.
The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself.
The plaintiff seeks damages and costs.
He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable.
He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD:
The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.).
In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed.
The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege.
This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth).
The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers.
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz).
The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body.
In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college.
The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege.
This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty.
The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties.
The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice.
There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds.
Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis.
There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident.
The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000.
Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","[418, 414, 401, 398, 422, 0, 426, 2, 425, 1, 15]"

The application is made pursuant to Rule 17 of The Court of Appeal Rules.
HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.
 1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers.
Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association.
It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally.
2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal.
The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations.
The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","[53, 55, 5, 52, 1, 6, 49, 47, 50, 12, 46]"
292,"[1] This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal tax purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall, known as the “Normanview Mall”.
The building, which is owned by the appellant company, HDL Investments Inc., was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its “fair value” as determined by the City Assessor.
The company was dissatisfied with the Assessor’s determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board.
The appeals were allowed in part, but the company remained dissatisfied.

The assessor is then to calculate and apply market adjustment factor in accordance with the manual.

Thus, it appears to have concluded, for whatever reason, that the Board ought not to have made the order.

The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall.
The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments.
They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee.

(3) The effect of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice.
Even if evidence is conscriptive, its admission will not render the trial unfair if the Crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.
It would surely affect the fairness of the trial should check stops be accepted as basis for warrantless searches and the evidence derived from them was to be automatically admitted.
[73] In Young, supra, the search of the accused's pocket was found to be unreasonable.
The Crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.
The situation is not analogous to Young where it was reasonable to conclude that the evidence would likely have been discovered by other means.","The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act.
The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police.
A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road.
The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance.
The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists.
The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself.
The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC.
He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine.
The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act.
The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches.
HELD: The evidence is excluded.
The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance.
The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime.
When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got.
The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question.
The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement.
The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation.
The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get.
The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van.
The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law.
The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated.
The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van.
The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.
The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","[368, 347, 374, 348, 352, 7, 6, 375, 356, 370, 34]"

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement.
Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness.

During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.

295,"[1] The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of Mr. Justice Kraus dated September 10, 1999, and December 7, 1999, and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and respondent in or about July, 2003.
In addition to variation of the amount of child support, the respondent asks that the variation order apply retroactively to July 1, 2003.
Finally, the respondent seeks costs to be assessed on solicitor/client basis.
This application to vary is opposed in many, but not all, respects by the petitioner.
[2] The petitioner and respondent consented to the order of Kraus J. dated September 10, 1999.
The respondent agreed to pay to the petitioner $250.00 per month as his share of Meghan’s special and/or extraordinary costs.
[3] The consent order of Kraus J. dated November 25, 1999, varied the earlier consent order of September 10, 1999, when the respondent became unemployed and received employment insurance only.
Absent such an agreement, s. of the Guidelines would require set-off based upon the parents’ respective incomes.
Neither the petitioner nor respondent have testified to any other household income other than the Canada Child Tax Benefit or GST rebate.
The plaintiff’s claim for reduction in the Table amount of child support must, therefore, fail.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support.
HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2)
The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children.
What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college.
What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006.
There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006.
3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part.
There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns.
No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines.
No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'.
The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310.
An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner.
The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.
4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually.
Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children.
5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.
The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","[214, 1, 3, 6, 212, 5, 4, 10, 199, 11]"

[7]Supra, Note 12.","Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.
The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint.
The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter.
Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount.
HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code.
1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment.
2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy.
Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions.
To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect.
3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement.
The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account.
It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.
 4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff.
No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25]
This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary.
The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts.
This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals.
For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment.
The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31]
One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator.
The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction.
It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction.
The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement.
To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","[222, 223, 232, 5, 0, 217, 218, 227, 16, 230, 20, 221, 8, 224, 30, 6]"

He rolled over the hood of the truck, travelled 25 to 30 feet, landing in the ditch in mud and grass.

300,"He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning.
The position of the defendants is that Mr. Hashemian was lawfully arrested for obstruction, and that the cut he received on his head was by-product of his resistance during arrest and did not involve any more force than was reasonably necessary.
Only one of the defendants, Constable Blaine Lynch, was responsible for the decision to arrest Mr. Hashemian and was solely involved in arresting him.

He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning.
The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service.
The City of Saskatoon is their employer.
HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle.
The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount.
It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements.
1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge.
The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty.
The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully.
The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty.
2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help.
Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa.
Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers.
Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty.
There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty.
3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions.
The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty.
The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed.
4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.

At first blush, one might assume the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking.
However, the terms of the proposed judgment are, in the opinion of the Court, unconscionable.
Second, the terms of the proposed consent judgment are clearly improvident.
Ms. Perra is prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earns only $15,000.00 year while Mr. Stopanski earns $48,000.00 year.
The proposed form of judgment confirms joint custody of the two children, who are ages 18 and 16, and that these children shall have their primary residence with Mr. Stopanski.

303,"The applicants filed an application May 6th 1991 by Originating Notice (Application Inter Partes) seeking an order setting aside an arbitration award made by S. Bruce Outhouse, Q.C., which award is dated April 4th 1991 and was completed May 3rd 1991.
The grievance arose and was brought forward through arbitration pursuant to collective agreement between the parties dated September 29th 1988.
The union alleges that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the employer conducted promotional routine for the position of lieutenants in the Halifax fire department for 1989.
It appears that the Halifax fire department does not conduct job competitions for individual vacancies in the ranks of lieutenant and captain, but rather holds promotional routines, so‑called, with respect to these positions, every two years.
Deputy Chief Bernard George Elliott was member of the promotional routine board for lieutenants in 1989.
THE COURT: What are your disbursements?
THE COURT: Miss Hebb, on the matter of costs?
THE COURT: All right.
Party and Party costs are rather insignificant when there is no specific amount involved and am not going to get into the tariff, am treating it solely as Chambers matter and will award costs of $750.00.
Anything further to be addressed counsel?
Thank you counsel.","The applicants sought a stay of proceedings pending review of an arbitration award.
The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior.
As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter.
Denying the stay,
that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","[153, 156, 4, 145, 148, 2, 139, 5, 6, 152, 10]"

I. Introduction
[1] Following a jury trial, David Horkoff was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences.
Mr. Horkoff appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe.
II. Basic Background
[2] In 2002, the R.C.M.P. received information that Mr. Horkoff was involved in growing marihuana and proceeded to obtain warrant to search farmyard near Canora, Saskatchewan.
On August 22, 2002, in preparation for the execution of the warrant, police officers were shown two pictures of Mr. Horkoff and told that he was likely driving white Tempo.
[3] On that same day, the R.C.M.P. searched the farmyard.
After 41 kilometre high speed chase, the Tempo was driven into ditch and, although Constable Badger gave chase, the driver escaped on foot.
Second, the trial judge also told the jury it could accept some, none or all of Mr. Holoboff’s evidence.
[29] In sum, we are not persuaded that the trial judge’s remarks would have unduly or improperly influenced the jury’s assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility.
B. The Sentence Appeal
He did suggest, however, that certain personal circumstances warrant his period of incarceration being reduced to time served.
We are not persuaded by these submissions.
Further, the sentences imposed by the trial judge were not demonstrably unfit.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora.
They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo.
The search revealed marijuana grow-op.
The accused was later seen by officers driving.
The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot.
Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial.
The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial.
He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison.
The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence.
HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op.
The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility.
The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","[0, 7, 5, 134, 124, 4, 128, 10, 132, 131, 14, 11, 21, 129, 13]"

2. for sexual purpose touch K.S., person under the age of 16, directly with part of his body, to wit his penis, contrary to section 151 of the Criminal Code.
The accused and the complainant are well acquainted with one another in fact their mothers are cousins.
At the time of the alleged offences, yet another sister (who shall refer to as C.Y.S.) was in relationship with the accused and they had two-year-old daughter.
I believe the testimony of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1.

The evidence similarly proves that J.T. touched K.S. for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with her contrary to section 151 of the Code.

308,"The constable met the Drake vehicle on Heritage Road and the officer performed U-turn to check the vehicle for licence, registration and sobriety.
[3] The officer stopped the Drake vehicle where he found the appellant as the lone occupant seated in the driver’s seat.
[4] He noted that she was smoking freshly lit cigarette which, in the officer’s experience, was tactic sometimes used by people to hide the smell of something.
[5] Cst. Schmidt asked Ms. Drake to put her cigarette out at which time he detected an odour of alcohol on her breath.
The officer attempted third call but was unsuccessful in reaching the lawyer and the officer was only able to leave message.
Once more the officer asked Mr. Porter if he wanted to contact another lawyer.
Mr. Wallner had been offered an opportunity to contact different lawyer but declined as he simply wanted to get the test completed.
[60] In the circumstances am satisfied that Ms. Drake has not established that she was diligent in her pursuit of legal counsel.
She said “no”.
She said that she was happy with just leaving a message.
Ms. Drake has received the benefit of orders suspending the withdrawal of her driving privileges.","Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal
The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights.
The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving.
The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft.
He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech.
She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol.
When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath.
He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still.
She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance.
When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five.
He arrested her and made the breath demand.
The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things.
With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested.
At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it.
A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received.
The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample.
The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer.
The officer called the number but received an after-hours message.
He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message.
She then provided her first breath sample.
The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.
 HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach.
The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired;
and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b).
The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","[4, 9, 8, 12, 316, 307, 318, 291, 300, 292, 322]"

Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself.
Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian.
The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other.
HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed.
Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre.
An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course.
He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.
 1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death.
It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death.
Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences.
2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident.
Alcohol was not involved.
He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately.
Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered.
3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences.
The accused had six speeding convictions.
He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","[38, 527, 9, 6, 528, 39, 44, 534, 45, 517, 1, 523, 2, 538, 12, 543, 533, 33, 530, 531, 505, 15, 542]"

Canada Trust could not bring an action to recover an overpayment from HRM at any time before the decision was rendered on the assessment by the appeal body.

Unlike Cherubin, supra the payment of taxes were not overpayments at the time they were paid.
There was no right to a refund of overpaid taxes until March 1997 when the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal rendered its decision upholding the reduction in the assessment.
An appropriate interest claim does exist under s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal assessment determination in March, 1997, and the payment of the property tax refund, in September 1997, as well as on the unpaid interest until date of judgment.

311,"[1] The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts.
The accused then pled guilty to these three counts:
COUNT 2 THAT HE, the said MICHAEL CHUDYK between the 25th day of November, A. D. 2006 and the 1st day of February, A. D. 2007 at or near Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did fraudulently and without colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of a credit card to credit card users contrary to Section 342(3) of the Criminal Code.
COUNT 5 THAT HE, the said MICHAEL CHUDYK between the 16th day of February, A.D. 2006 and the 19th day of August, A. D. 2007 at or near Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did fraudulently personate various persons, living or dead, with an intent to gain advantage for himself or another person, contrary to Section 403(a) of the Criminal Code.
COUNT 2 Incarceration for two years and three months.
COUNT 5 Incarceration for two years, concurrent with the preceding sentences.
[23] In the end, it is denunciation and deterrence, both of the accused and others, which must be emphasized and obtain a priority.","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences.
The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names.
He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services.
The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44.
The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items.
The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18.
The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail.
He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders.
In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities.
He plead guilty.
HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months.
The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody.
The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a).
The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused.
The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea.
The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","[0, 2, 12, 3, 112, 5, 10]"
312,"[1] The appellants appeal their convictions for the following two offences under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, as am. (the ""Act""):
[3] The appellants raised a number of grounds for the appeal which may be summarized as follows:
The Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the matter by reason of alleged defects in the summons or alternatively the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s. 11(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;
That the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister\'s behalf.
[45] It must also be noted that The Interpretation Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. I-11.2 as am., now contains the following provision:
It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.
The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.
The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment.
CONCLUSION [48] I can find no error by the trial judge and the appeal is therefore dismissed.","An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act.
Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant.
The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection.
Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel.
There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing.
The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances.
2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party.
This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code.
Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed.
It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns.
3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326.
The appellants filed blank returns.
The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.
 It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all.
4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b).
Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage.
The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced.
Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.
 5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister.
Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing.
Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties.
The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation.
It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.
 The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.
 It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal.
The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.
The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","[9, 156, 167, 161, 165, 0, 4, 166, 5]"

In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents.
An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out.
The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence.
Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report.
The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time.
The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour.
The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure.
She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy.
HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report.
It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report.
There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time.
The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old.
He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court.
The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program.
The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report.
The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties.

314,"The learned trial judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I‑6 was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider.

As Justice Edwards concluded that all the assignments made by Mr.
am of the opinion the learned Chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s. 89(1) of the Indian Act.
"".. the purpose of the legislation is not to remedy the economically disadvantaged position of Indians by ensuring that Indians may acquire, hold and deal with property in the commercial mainstream on different terms than their fellow citizens.
An examination of the decisions bearing on these sections confirms that Indians who acquire and deal in property outside lands reserved for their use deal with it on the same basis as all other Canadians.""
These provisions are not intended to confer privileges on Indians in respect of any property they may acquire and possess, wherever situated.

and L. MARTIN (1984) INC., body corporate
and EASTLAND INDUSTRIES LIMITED, body corporate","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve.
Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants.
The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.
He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1).
He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them.
The appellants appealed.
Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act,
that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans.
When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians.
Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments.
The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","[8, 564, 565, 5, 26, 32, 35, 31, 24, 59]"

[1] The parties were married in Sweden on October 3rd, 1996 having previously been married in Cuba in 1991 and then divorced in Sweden in 1993.
[2] The parties agree that all property has been divided to their respective mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt, in Sweden, of approximately 34,000 krona is their joint responsibility.
[3] Following separation the parties, then each represented by counsel, consented to Family Court Order wherein the Petitioner was ordered to pay, as spousal support, the sum of $600.00 per month for twelve month period, commencing on January 1, 1999 and continuing on the 1st day of each month thereafter.
[5] The Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.3 (2nd Supp.), (herein referred to as “the Act”), was proclaimed in force December 12, 1988.
At para. 32, Justice Macdonald on behalf of the Court observed:
Maintenance settlements or awards should be as final as possible to reduce continuing conflict of the parties and to discourage multiplicity of proceedings, so long as this can be done without prejudice and to the primary principle that maintenance must be reasonably adequate.
[34] There is also the strong likelihood the Respondent will be moving to Sweden in the near future.","In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country.
She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement.
The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family.
Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife;
when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","[0, 2, 3, 5, 134, 6, 139, 133, 13]"

CROWN RESPONDENT

Ban on Publication concerning the charges in this case was placed by Preliminary Inquiry Judge to continue until commencement of trial.
Therefore any content of this file which quotes or reveals evidence contained from the Preliminary Inquiry is banned from publication and so will continue until the date of trial.
The intercepts formed the background of the charges against the accused.

The learned Judge having specifically excluded the Keepings and Laurie Campbell from the reading of Section 541(1), cannot bring them back under this mandatory requirement by simply reminding them that they heard it read yesterday.

317,"[1] The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders.
[2] The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim, which includes the two principal individuals of the plaintiff corporations, shall be collectively referred to as the “plaintiffs”.
The claims and counterclaims arose as result of one of the defendants, Mark Wolff, leaving the employ of the plaintiffs’ consulting partnership.
The statement of claim alleges that Wolff, along with Clayton Sparks, set up competing business through their corporation, Advance‑Tek Consulting Inc.
The plaintiffs are consultants to businesses applying for scientific research and experimental development (“SR&ED”) grants from the Canada Revenue Agency.
The plaintiffs allege that they have developed unique application process for the SR&ED grants.
[3] The plaintiffs state that Wolff is bound by confidentiality and non‑competition agreement with DT Consulting.
The plaintiffs seek injunctions against the defendants, return of property taken by the defendants, and damages for breach of contract and disgorgement of all profits gained through the breaches of fiduciary obligations.
[27] The defendants’ application to strike these portions of the claim is dismissed.
Paragraphs 10, 11 and 23 are material facts, relevant to the plaintiffs’ claim of Wolff’s breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.
[29] The defendants’ application to strike portions of the plaintiffs’ claim is dismissed.","FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim.
They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent.
Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages.
The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim.
HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction.
Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27.
Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit.
There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action.
The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary.
Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability.
The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated.
Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm.
This joint venture requires confidentiality.
Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence.
Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established.
It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them.
The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim.
The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course.
2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed.
The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics.
The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics.
While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act.
The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","[3, 0, 4, 8, 5, 7, 135, 132, 6, 130, 11]"

The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992.
The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.
1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.

HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied.
2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue.
There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports.
However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application.
In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue.
However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found.
Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre.
It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","[114, 1, 113, 5, 104, 7, 107, 6, 10]"

325,"[2] The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner’s affidavit of October 16, 2012, including Exhibit “A” which is captioned as Minutes of a Four-Way Meeting.
The petitioner does not suggest that all outstanding issues were resolved at the settlement meeting.

The court noted that settlement privilege is jointly held privilege which cannot be waived by any one party acting alone.
[21] find the petitioner to have Guideline income of $87,178.00 and the respondent Guideline income of $18,884.00.
The petitioner’s share of s. expenses would be 81.5%.
Pursuant to s. 9(a) of the Guidelines, the petitioner shall pay child support to the respondent of $1,213.00 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter.
The petitioner shall pay his proportionate share of such other s. 7 expenses as the parties may agree upon.
In the event they cannot agree, an application may be made in chambers.
Should there be any dispute with respect to this or if it is appropriate to set monthly payment on account of any arrears which might exist as of the date of this order, the appropriate application may be made in chambers.","The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues.
The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'.
The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting.
The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount.
The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession.
The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it.
She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000.
The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children.
HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement.
Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck.
The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013.
The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses.
The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month.
The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","[6, 9, 120, 7, 126, 122, 123, 119, 118, 1]"

JUDGMENT April 8, 2002 KRUEGER J.
[1] This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 percent.
[2] No hearing was conducted, but the facts were agreed to by counsel.
On December 29, 2000, the respondent was driving on highway number 17 in Lloydminster.
[3] On February 8, 2001, an Alberta prosecutor wrote to the R.C.M.P. in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, suggesting that the same two charges against the respondent be “re-laid” in Saskatchewan.
An information was sworn in Saskatchewan on March 1, 2001, and brought before the Provincial Court in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, on March 5, 2001.
See R. v. Keyowski, 1988 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1988]
This is one of those “clearest of cases” that justifies stay.
CONCLUSION [22] The trial judge erred in finding that the special plea of autrefois acquit was applicable in this case.
Any reference by the trial judge to loss of jurisdiction over the offence was unintentional.
Clearly the trial judge was referring to loss of jurisdiction as contained in s. 485(2) of the Code.
His conclusion that the proceedings were abusive was in accordance with the information before him.","The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08.
The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law.
Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months.
Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges.
At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law.
HELD: The Informations were stayed.
The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction.
1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution.
Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis).
The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001.
A summons was not issued until August.
The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3).
'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'.
It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court.
Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location.
The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first.
3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta.
The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001.
The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3).
There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken.
The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances.
4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process.
The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress.
The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice.
The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","[108, 109, 110, 4, 1, 2, 106, 12, 0, 11, 5, 104, 105]"
327,"Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add new claim against new defendant.
He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment.

II. FACTS AND DECISION UNDER APPEAL:
Concurred in:
Appendix “A”
(3) An amendment to correct the name of party may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that it is alleged that the effect of the amendment will be to substitute new party if the Court is satisfied that the mistake sought to be corrected was genuine mistake and was not misleading or such as to cause any reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person intending to sue or, as the case may be, intended to be sued.
(5) An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.","Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver.
The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer.
The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application.
The plaintiff appealed.
Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned.
The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule.
Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","[192, 190, 186, 185, 1, 3, 13, 9, 8]"

Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done.
The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court.
2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert.
3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance.
4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected.

334,"Charge: (1) s.5(2) CDSA, possession of cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking
(5) 733.1(1)(a) CC, breach of Probation
The defense seek an order excluding admission of the accused’s statement to the police and exclusion of the results of the search of the accused’s person.
[53] In my view, the facts or circumstances known to the arresting officer at the time of arrest provide a sufficient basis to conclude, and I do conclude, that the officer’s subjective belief that Mr. Stone was in possession of marihuana was objectively reasonable.
I accept the evidence of Constable Lynch and find that the search of Mr. Stone was incident to his arrest and for the lawful purpose of securing evidence.
In my view, the manner of search, given the nature of the alleged offence was reasonable. 
[55] The violation of the accused’s section 10(b) right upon detention was brief and no evidence was obtained as result of the breach; therefore, no exclusion of evidence will result.
[56] If am in error in concluding that the law permits an arresting officer to rely on an inference to “find person committing an offence,” let me say that, without the inference in this case, the arresting officer had insufficient cause to arrest Mr. Stone.
[57] The motion to exclude the accused’s statement to the police is denied.
[58] The motion to exclude the results of the search of the accused’s person is denied.","The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation.
Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana.
When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse.
He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him.
After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment.
The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs.
Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon.
The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search.
He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights.
Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied.
The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached.
While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary.
Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning.
After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case.
Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable.
The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana.
The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge.
Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful.
The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable.
In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","[256, 257, 17, 10, 250, 249, 252, 253, 6, 246]"

The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","[41, 0, 37, 7, 2, 3, 8, 34, 12, 30, 36, 16, 35]"

It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4.
[3] Secondly, the case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base.
There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences.
More particularly, there was no evidence that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate.

GERWING J.A.
The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code.
The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of money for sexual favours was contemplated.
However, as we have repeatedly said in the exercise of our appellate capacity both with respect to judgments and jury charges, the entire reasons must be read to understand the true ratio.
... think the evidence ... has to be relatively specific on the issue of money for specific sexual services.
However on a reading of the entire oral judgment, we are of the view she was, in effect, saying that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place.
Thus, while noting that the statement of law by the judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench in his appellate capacity was correct, we are the view that the appropriate disposition is to set aside his judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.","The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution.
A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services.
The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt.
HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.
1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place.
2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.","[22, 25, 1, 19, 21, 6, 15, 7]"
339,"and Lee Charron
Appearing: Mr. Barrie Stricker For the Crown
DECISION ON CHARTER APPLICATION R. GREEN,
[1] Mr. Charron is charged with operating or with being in the care or control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol on August 25, 2009, at Rocanville.
Count number two on the information operating or being in care or control of vehicle over .08 was dismissed by me upon the defence application for nonsuit.
[2] During the testimony of Cst. Pshyk, the final Crown witness, an issue arose about whether the defence had been provided with full disclosure by the Crown.
Nevertheless, in effect, question that never would have been asked with full disclosure was asked, and the response by the Crown became part of the evidence at this trial.
As result, view the appropriate remedy to be exclusion of the evidence which flowed from the breach of Mr. Charron’s right to make full answer and defence under s. 7.
[13] I order, pursuant to s. 24(1), that the Operational Checksheets (Exhibits P-2, P-3, D1 and D2) and any reference to Exhibit P-2 in the re-direct examination of Cst. Psych be excluded from evidence at this trial.
As the Crown has completed its case, we will now proceed with the defence case, as Mr. Moore has indicated that defence intends to call evidence at this trial.","The accused was charged with impaired care or control.
The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application.
During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying.
During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech.
In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.
 The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence.
HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document.
The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown.
The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out.
While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence.
This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","[50, 49, 53, 51, 2, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8]"
340,"His interpretation of the section was that Armoyan is required to continue ditch or drain to proper outlet and ""...entitled to construct it through the Haverstock lands"".
If Dr. Waller has the authority to do as he purports to do then he appears to be ""statutory authority"" which means ""...any person or body empowered by statute to expropriate land or cause injurious affection"".
S.4 of the Expropriation Act reads:
(2) The provisions of any general or special act providing procedures with respect to the expropriation of land or the compensation payable for land expropriated or for injurious affection shall be deemed to refer to this act and not to the act in question.
(3) Where there is conflict between provision of this act and the provisions of any other or special act, the provision of this act prevails.""
Where the Haverstock lands are not to be benefited by the installation of ditch or drain and the Estate has not consented to the construction of same, the Act is not applicable.
SCOPE OF APPEAL
In any event, have also concluded that s. 12 would give me the powers to hear the matter de novo if it were necessary.
COSTS Finally with respect to Dr. Waller's award of his costs against Armoyan refer to ss. 15 of the Act.
award costs in the amount of $3,000.00 all inclusive to the appellant as against the respondent.","The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road.
When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement.
The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer.
The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions.
In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act.
Allowing the appeal,
that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost.
However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch.
Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","[140, 147, 148, 150, 144, 137, 139, 143, 123, 136]"

[27] See: 61 Am Jur 2d, pg. 62, para. 52.","The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease.
In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959.
The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993.
After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner.
The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence.
HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V.
The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench.
1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule.
The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive.
The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society.
The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times.
Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae.
Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule.
Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.
 2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease.
The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed.
The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general.
The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property.
A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough.
The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision.
The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease.
As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971.
The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future.
The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","[981, 1016, 982, 1027, 1, 1020, 992, 995, 5, 1009, 1002, 1007, 1010, 1008, 973]"
344,"1 The accused is charged that he did, on February 26, 2001 in Swift Current district, Saskatchewan, operate a motor vehicle that violated the Minister\'s weight order contrary to section 38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997.
According to his evidence, ""knowing that highway #332 was under restriction"" the officer stopped the vehicle which, at that time, was being operated by the accused.
There were three sets of axles on the unit- steering axle, drive axles and tridem axles.
No overweigt permit had been issued to the accused and so the officer issued ticket to the accused.
In the circumstances, the municipal council directed that notice of the Minister's order be given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods.
There was no publication in the Saskatchewan Gazette or in any other print media circulated in the area.
It is not for me to advise the Minister.
I can only conclude that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.
Accordingly, it has not been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused violated the provisions of section 38(1)(b) of HTA.
Of SASKATCHEWAN","The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act.
No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer.
The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case.
HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b).
It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.
 1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied.
Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.
 2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given.
The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given.
The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public.
Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish.
3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described.
The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA).
It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","[0, 3, 94, 90, 85, 12, 84, 7, 79, 8]"

I found that it did not and as a result there was a breach of the accused’s rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.
I then conducted an analysis pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights.
Lisa McDonnel saw one person in the car, who find to be Curtis Francis, who was slumped over onto the passenger side of the car and appeared to be asleep.

[76] am of the view that the evidence establishes that Mr. Francis was driving his Tempo vehicle on 6th Avenue when he lost control of the vehicle and struck the electrical utility box and power pole.
The impact and resulting damage to the passenger side of the Tempo, in my view, account for some movement of Mr. Francis’ body within the vehicle.

The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals.
His body was slumped over into the passenger side.
The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage.
The engine was running when the police arrived.
There was no one else in the vehicle.
The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant.
The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol.
The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain.
The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8.
The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.
The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious.
Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code.
However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis.
The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain.
The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights.
The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis.
The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision.
There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle.
The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.
The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","[21, 20, 345, 357, 352, 354, 343, 4]"

OF ORAL DECISION: December 23, 1993
COUNSEL: A. Pavey, for the Appellant
will deliver decision.
44 (1) An appeal lies to the county court from any decision, judgment or order of court or judge thereof.
Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court.
In his factum, the appellant counsel set out number of factual matters.
The respondent, in his factum, accepts these facts but with certain stipulated exceptions.
Section 37 of the Family Maintenance Act provides;
""A court may order maintenance to be paid periodically or in lump sum or in combination thereof.""
There is no finality to the orders made under the Family Maintenance Act, nor was there any finality to the order made by Judge MacDonald.
The common‑law obligation for parent to support child by maintenance is incorporated in the Family Maintenance Act in Section 8.
It seems clear to me that Judge Levy erred when he thought he could not consider the application before him.
For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds and I direct that the matter be sent back to Judge Levy for a hearing on the merits.
No costs will be awarded.
J. Halifax, Nova Scotia","This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered.
The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application.
Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court,
that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation.
The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances.
Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","[64, 66, 60, 1, 2, 9, 63, 0, 12, 68, 4, 59, 56, 67, 15, 16]"

There are many circumstances in which the bar against relitigation, either through the doctrine of res judicata or that of abuse of process, would create unfairness.

concur “Herauf J.A.”
Herauf J.A.","HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal.
Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act.
The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested.
The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act.
However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","[209, 208, 205, 207, 199, 17, 189, 13, 0, 198, 33, 195, 180]"

2. DB pleaded guilty and was convicted on March 27, 1995 of sexually assaulting MJD under s. 271 of the Canadian Criminal Code.
4. MJD claims to suffer from depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the sexual assault.
5. In October 1996 DND, without MJD’s involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to fit to perform the duties of her trade or employment.
7. MJD applied to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for pension July 16, 1997.
As such, absent new information, the plaintiff would have nowhere to go to seek relief or redress.
[18] It is also inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension the plaintiff is precluded from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time.
Assuming an individual accepts the Minister’s denial but believes for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy against the Crown counsel’s position would require the plaintiff to pursue meaningless appeals simply to meet the conditions of s. and s. 111.
[19] Counsel for the plaintiff, in concluding his written submission, says:","After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces.
She applied for and was denied a pension.
Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection.

The applicant applied for and was denied a pension.
Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her.

[1] The appellant seeks to have the support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater.
[2] The respondent’s income is largely the product of the operation of relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings.
The appellant seeks to have the respondent’s income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance.
There is no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and this grain is therefore to be viewed as part of the gross income of the respondent in the year in which it is sold.
[4] The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment.
What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowance should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the chamber judge in this instance.

1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved.
Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult.
The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings.

[8] Moreover, am in total agreement with my colleague Noble J. of this Court who in his judgment dealing with other issues of this action took the time to express his concerns over the delay the plaintiff had up to that time been subjected to by the paper war conducted by the parties to the cross-claim and third party proceedings (see Noble J.'s judgment dated November 23, 2000).
[9] I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of justice that the order of severance sought by the plaintiff should be granted so that the issue raised in the action may proceed to an early trial.

The applicant applied for an order severing the issues from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial.
The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates.
HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial.
The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time.

First, he is now employed as tow truck driver, and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510.00.
Second, following the consent order he purchased a one-half ton truck on which he has been making payments of $624.00 per month.

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed.
The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order.
The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

(c) Did the Landlord cause or contribute to the loss?

15(2) Where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself, or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured, the Court may set aside the award.
They also say there was no refusal of entry to the Landlord by the Tenant.
The dispute was over whether the Tenant had to give the Landlord notice to have the benefit of the Landlord’s insurance coverage.
This is dispute about s. 4.02 of the lease which provides for insurance coverage for the “mutual benefit” of the Landlord and the Tenant.
To resolve that dispute, the arbitrator concluded that for the Tenant to benefit it must give notice.
This is dispute about clauses or provisions of the lease which it was within the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to adjudicate upon.
In doing so, he did not make a patently unreasonable finding.
There is rational basis for this conclusion evident from his decision.","A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage.
The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease.
The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity.
The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision.
Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision.
The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel.
Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable.
The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","[9, 7, 476, 474, 477, 469, 478, 473, 472, 21, 27, 23, 32]"

They claim that the Steel Works’ facilities emitted lead, arsenic, PAH’s and other toxins.

[5] Justice Murphy’s decision summarizes the tenor of this lawsuit:
[5] During the more than seven years since this proceeding commenced, including while the certification issue has been pending, the scope of the plaintiffs' claim has been substantially reduced.
The defendants have not filed notice of defence; pursuant to section 4(6) of the Act they are not required to do so until 45 days after certification order is issued, and the court dismissed plaintiffs' motion seeking earlier filing.
Given that premise, there is no evidence of any confusion that would irreparably affect the progress of the litigation.
That is par for the course of appellate litigation, not irreparable harm.
There is no basis for stay under Fulton’s primary test.
[41] The litigation began in 2004, before its conversion to class proceeding several years later.",", motion denied.
While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright.
If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims.
The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding.
There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved.
The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file.
To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","[1, 0, 11, 13, 162, 165, 14, 159, 4, 15, 157]"

APPEAL DIVISION
Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: HALLETT, J.A.",", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife.
The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault.
Allowing the appeal,
that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity.
The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward.
The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","[147, 149, 150, 1, 2, 146, 153, 142, 7, 5, 135, 131, 3, 12, 4, 9, 10]"

Hunter Miller also points out that the segregation of the computer files on the firm`s computer network took place four working days after Ms. Fitzsimmons started her employment.
am also of the opinion that the instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried with them the implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to.

The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm.
At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes.

(2) In an application for judicial review, other than proceeding to which the Criminal Code applies, an applicant may claim:
(a) declaration as collateral or alternate relief; or
(3) Every application shall state the grounds on which it is made and the relief sought.
[50] In considering the first of these potential interpretations, the Board does not appear to consider the full impact of the fact that the applicant was unaware of her right to apply for such benefits.
Her husband’s employer neither notified the Board of Mr. Truitt’s death nor did it explain to Ms. Truitt that she had right to consider potential claim under the legislation.
[52] In determining that it would not be just to waive the six month reporting requirement in s. 45 of the Act, the Board focuses on its belief as to the cause of Mr. Truitt’s death, an inquiry which the presumptive portion of s. 30 indicates should not occur.
Further, there shall be an attendant order of mandamus compelling the Board to perform its statutory duty to apply the presumption set forth in s. 30 of The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979, supra, in the applicant’s favour.","The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.
He became ill while teaching a class.
His students helped him to the faculty lounge.
He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later.
Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital.
An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later.
The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim.
The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674.
HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979.
The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption.
2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant.
3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing.
4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","[4, 0, 12, 282, 281, 289, 16, 13, 287]"
364,"The charges read as follows:
1. That on or about the 17th day of October 1996 at St. George’s Hill, Saskatchewan he did fail to ensure, in so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work, of his worker, Kenneth Shatilla, contrary to S. 57 of the Act (as above).
7. That he did contravene S. 260(7) of the Regulations by failing to ensure that when worker was required to enter trench, safe means of access to and egress from the trench is provided at suitable locations, contrary to S. 57(b) of the Act.

[24] Mr. Peterson violated the law by his failure to take any reasonable precautions to prevent
death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for on the worksite in St. George’s Hill.
Dated at the Town of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan the 27th of September, 1999.","The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations.
It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability.
The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances.
The essential facts were not in dispute.
HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.
 1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met.
This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site.
Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available.
Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced.
The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching.
No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision.
The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups.
2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible.
There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor.
The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship.
The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","[2, 8, 184, 183, 185, 189, 20, 190, 12, 1, 192, 23]"
365,"By the Court:
[1] INTRODUCTION: The Applicant, Wickwire Holm, has requested a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the Respondent, Melanie Stephen.
[3] At the outset of the taxation hearing, Ms. Stephen made motion requesting that recuse myself because of an alleged apprehension of bias.
After hearing from both parties and considering the matter, dismissed that motion.
Specifically, decided to limit the extent of Ms. Stephen's cross‑examination for reasons explained at the hearing.
[6] THE RECUSAL MOTION: As indicated, Ms. Stephen made motion at the outset of the taxation hearing requesting that recuse myself.
Ms. Stevenson's representation of the Respondent immediately followed Mr. Miller's representation of the Respondent.
Ms. Stephen says that due to Ms. Stevenson's negligence, Ms. Stephen was locked out of her home with only the clothes on her back.
[87] That being said, Ms. Stephen seems to have had an unusual number of possessions in the matrimonial home just few short hours before she knew, based upon information provided by Ms. Stevenson, that she had to vacate the premises.
There is no authority of which am aware that supports this argument nor is there any principled reason that can think of to explain why such an argument should be sustained.
Small Claims Court Adjudicator","The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter.
The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home.
Accounts as presented are certified;
there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced.
It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness.
The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","[9, 13, 4, 3, 10, 196, 16, 192, 200, 181, 20]"

The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties.
The merger agreement provided in part at clause 2.11 that:
17.01 Arbitration At any time while this Agreement and any of its provisions are in force, should any dispute or question arise between Partner and either another Partner or the Partnership concerning the interpretation of this Agreement or any part thereof which cannot be resolved by agreement among those Parties, then such dispute or question will be submitted to arbitration as herein provided by one Partner giving notice to the other Partner in dispute or if to the Partnership, to the C.E.O. ...

After the merger, the plaintiff signed new partnership agreement that said arbitration would apply to any disputes between partner and the partnership.
HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration.
The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement.

367,"As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the evidence of third Crown witness Constable Walz was called on voir dire.
His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application.
78: Similarly, an unreasonable search contrary to s. of the Charter may impact on the protected interests of privacy, and more broadly, human dignity.
[28] With respect to the third line of inquiry, society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits, the Supreme Court in Grant explained at para.
Thus the Court suggested in Collins that judge on 24(2) application should consider not only the negative impact of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice, but the impact of failing to admit the evidence.
On the other hand, where the violation is less egregious and the intrusion is less severe in terms of privacy, bodily integrity and dignity, reliable evidence obtained from the accused’s body may be admitted.
Accordingly, an assessment based on this criteria, would also favour the admission of the evidence. 
[30] In balancing the three lines of evaluation directed in Grant, would conclude that the admission of the certificate would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08.
He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused.
The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded.
The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk.
The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number.
He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane.
The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane.
The officer activated his emergency equipment.
The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle.
The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle.
The officer did not note smell of alcohol.
HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid.
While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told.
Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused.
In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol.
The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol.
The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality.
In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body.
The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds.
No charter breach was established.
The certificate was not excluded.","[154, 144, 155, 152, 141, 8, 148, 9]"

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application.
At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready.
The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home.
The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him.
The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared.
The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school.
The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained.
The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist.
The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements. 
There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born.
The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny.
The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time.
The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle.
The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance.
The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs.
HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school.
The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner.
The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue.
The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested.
The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.
The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause.
The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","[6, 321, 328, 313, 291, 307, 308, 314, 9, 4, 301, 7, 12]"

I. Introduction
[1] Kelly Gene Bromm (the “father”) appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties’ children.
II. Background and Evidence
[2] The father and Leanne Marie Bromm (the “mother”) were married in 1993 and separated in June of 2004.
Shortly thereafter the mother brought an application to vary child support.
The parties went to mediation and were able to resolve some of their issues but not all of the custody and access issues.
The father argued that he had adjusted his position at work to accommodate parenting needs, and that child psychologist had described the children as balanced and happy in both homes.
[26] The father argues that the Chambers judge erred by finding the children’s wishes to be irrelevant.
The father focuses primarily on the letters from the psychologists attached to his own affidavit.
Conclusion [29] There is no material error, or misapprehension of the evidence, or error of law by the Chambers judge in proceeding on the evidence she had before her and in her determination of the children’s best interests and her crafting of a suitable order.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
Ottenbreit J.A.
Richards J.A.","The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment.
The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below.
The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant.
For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances.
No error was made on this issue.
The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz.
The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting.
She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests.
There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them.
The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children.
There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","[148, 150, 16, 0, 131, 4, 8, 139, 5, 9, 144, 20, 145, 17]"

The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination.
The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work.
The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked.
The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges.
She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended.
The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.
 2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one.
The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law.
The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them.
4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","[186, 8, 6, 182, 5, 185, 175, 188, 12, 180, 0, 161, 166, 171, 14, 179, 10, 9, 178, 181, 157, 154, 24, 32, 21]"

The appellant has commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision.
[3] The respondent did not attend the hearing and indicated by letter that he supports Dr. Miller’s position.
[4] Dr Miller has provided the appellant with complete copy of his file and has answered several interrogatories concerning the medical services he provided to the appellant.
Appellant’s counsel indicates the other three urologists whose names were provided by Dr. Miller also declined to act as an expert witness.
For instance, opinions relating to the diagnosis and treatment provided are required, such as those suggested in interrogatories numbers 8, and 10 of the first set of interrogatories; namely, Dr. Miller’s opinion as to whether the appellant had received complete circumcision when he first saw his penis on September 4, 1998; his reasons for performing surgery in September, 1998; and what Dr. Miller thought in September, 1998, would be the consequences to the appellant if he had not operated.
[27] While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions Dr. Miller should attempt to use language that can be understood by the appellant, his counsel and the court.
[28] This decision expressly does not deal with the issue of physicians who are co-defendants or non-party physicians who have not subsequently treated party to the litigation.

The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial.
Appeal allowed in part;
the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given.
Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided.
However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided.

The appellants George Hagblom and George Hagblom Masonry Ltd. apply to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action.
S.C.R. 480; R. v. Osiowy and Osiowy (1989) 1989 CanLII 5146 (SK CA), 80 Sask. R. 14 (Sask C.A.).
The appellant contends that the expert evidence which he wishes to tender is relevant, credible and if believed could reasonably, when taken with all the other evidence, be expected to have affected the result.
He candidly concedes however that, with due diligence it could have been adduced at the trial.
Dealing with the appeal proper, we are allo the opinion it must be denied.
The standard of review is that as articulated in Lensen v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII (SCC), [1987]
We are not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire.
The appeal is dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim.
The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence.
1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called.
2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire.
There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","[0, 4, 26, 24, 23, 5, 16, 9, 10, 22, 15, 17, 1]"
373,"[2] The grounds of appeal with respect to the conviction are as follows:
1. The evidence does not support guilty verdict for dangerous driving.
The Applicable Law
[3] S. 249(1) of the Criminal Code provides:
Counsel for the appellant points out that the accused gave chase to the Timothy Iron motor vehicle because he believed its occupants had stolen some tapes from the accused's vehicle.
[21] Counsel points out that the accused's conduct was at the low end of the continuum of conduct constituting dangerous driving such that it was described by the trial judge as being just ""shades over the line.""
Nevertheless, he notes that at page 99 of the transcript the learned trial judge stated as follows:
He says that he has learned from the experience, and believe him when he says that.
[23] The prohibition from driving for 18 months imposed by the Court is consistent with the prohibition generally imposed where conduct constituting dangerous driving has resulted in bodily injury or death or, at the very least, serious property damage.
[24] In my opinion, a prohibition of 18 months was excessive.
In the circumstances a prohibition of nine months' duration is more appropriate and I so order.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving (Criminal Code s.249(1)(a)) and sentence of a $1,200 fine, $180 surcharge, and 18 month driving prohibition.
In issue was whether the evidence found by the trial judge established both the mens rea and actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt.
The sentence appeal was brought on the ground it did not take into account mitigating circumstances, case law or sentencing principles.
HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.
The driving prohibition was reduced to 9 months.
The fine and surcharge were confirmed.
1)By applying the wrong standard, the trial judge committed an error of law, but no miscarriage of justice occurred.
When the correct standard, as enunciated in Hundal, is applied to the evidence as found by the trial judge, the conviction was appropriate.
2)The application of the Stellato principle to a charge of dangerous driving under s.249(1) was an error in law.
The conclusion that the Crown need only establish proof of any degree of impairment and not a marked departure from normal behaviour does not apply to a charge under s.249.
Simple judgmental errors in routine driving do not constitute conduct amounting to a marked departure from the standard of care required.
Mere negligence or driving without due care and attention are not sufficient.
3)The accused's evidence did not address how fast he was going (he stated his speedometer was not working) nor over what route or the time of the chase.
There was ample evidence on those issues from the two Crown witnesses.
4)The findings of fact established the appellant's driving conduct did amount to a marked departure from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise in those circumstances.
The test is whether a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in his driving conduct.
The accused engaged in a planned and deliberate course of conduct when he gave chase and continued over a significant distance at a high speed at night with children and other pedestrians in the vicinity.
It was not necessary for the Crown to establish the collision caused significant damage or that a collision occurred at all.
The acceptance of the accused's assertion that the collision was inadvertent did not mean the Crown failed to prove the necessary mens rea.
5)An 18 month prohibition was excessive.
The conduct was at the low end of the continuum.

[2] The petitioner is not opposed to an order granting (or more appropriately “confirming”) joint custody of Keandra Frass, with the respondent being designated as the primary caregiver and the respondent’s residence being the primary residence of Keandra.
Therefore, it is ordered that the petitioner shall parent Keandra each school day commencing after school recesses for the day until the respondent is finished her work and therefore able to pick Keandra up.
In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support in the sum of $700.00 per month commencing effective April 1, 2006 and on the first day of each and every month hereafter until further order.
The respondent is no longer expected to contribute $80.00 per month to service family debt.
The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future.
Each party presented meritorious arguments as to the outstanding issues dealing with extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support.","FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support.
HELD: 1)
The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent.
The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2)
The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law.
At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law.
What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents?
Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support?
2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.
 3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse.
These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI.
These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case.
However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim.
In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders.
In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700.
The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","[2, 0, 62, 64, 5, 61, 60]"
377,"BRIEFS FILED: APPELLANT'S BRIEF BY DECEMBER 31, 1995
WRITTEN DECISION: FEBRUARY 16, 1996
CHARGE: SECTION 254(5) C.C.C.
ANTHONY W. BROWN, FOR THE RESPONDENT.
This is an appeal by the appellant, Allen Wade Spidell, against a decision of The Honourable Judge Anne E. Crawford dated October 24, 1995 wherein she convicted the appellant of an offence that:
""At or near Auburndale, in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did unlawfully, without reasonable excuse, refuse to comply with the demand made to him by Constable Gary Jonathan White, Peace Officer, to provide then or as soon thereafter as is practicable, samples of his blood as in the opinion of qualified medical practitioner were necessary to enable proper analysis to be made, in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary to Section 254(5) of the Criminal Code of Canada.""
That report included the results of the blood alcohol tests from the first blood sample and diagnosis the appellant was intoxicated at the time of being treated in the emergency department.
Justice Major held the provision to the police by Dr. Gilbert of specific medical information about the appellant without his consent violated Dr. Gilbert's common law duty of confidentiality to the appellant.
Here, the obtaining of the information from Dr. Kydd as the basis of formulating the demand is not analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of Section 8 of the Charter.
In Dersh there were actions analogous to search and seizure.
I therefore dismiss the appeal.","This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated.
When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital.
As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain.
The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer.
Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code.
The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter.
Dismissing the appeal,
that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.
The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","[4, 1, 55, 7, 5, 51, 52, 48, 47, 8, 9]"
378,"1. The conviction is against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence;
[3] Both of the appellants are of Metis heritage, being direct descendants of Metis people who took scrip in 1906 at Ile-a-la-Crosse and who, while living in the community of Sapwagamik, engaged in the traditional Metis way of life.
The respondent acknowledges that if the appellants are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.
The question of whether the Regulation infringes the Aboriginal right of the Metis will be discussed below, but find that the Regulation is law of general application and that the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity is not triggered by it.
As stated by Cory J. in R. v. Horseman, 1990 CanLII 96 (SCC), [1990]
The regulation applies to the appellants as hunters, not as Metis.
CONCLUSION [27] It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable.
Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law.
The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.","An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting.
The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity.
The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns.
The facts were not in dispute.
The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land.
The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.
However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety.
At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.
2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable.
There was no wrong decision on a question of law.
 3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute.
Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights.
Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights.
As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component.
The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws.
Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces.
All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test.
The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable.
Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights.
Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right.
In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied.
No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous.
The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential.
The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik.
The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).
 6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose.
Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act.
7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted.
8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement.
If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation.
It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component.
9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them.
Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary.
They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution.
The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","[189, 191, 11, 185, 190, 2, 182, 8, 192]"
379,"[1] bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate.
The report, dated February 8, 1996, also stated that the applicant’s duties under the Act had been satisfactorily performed; that her conduct either before or after the bankruptcy was not subject to censure; and that she had not committed any offence in connection with the bankruptcy.
Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant’s homestead.
Nevertheless, the report noted that the “trustee is transmitting an 82% interest in the real property to the trustee’s name.”
If this result were permitted, property acquired by the debtor after an absolute discharge in bankruptcy would be appropriated to payment of the discharged debtor's debts.
That argument supposes that it is appropriate in summary bankruptcy administration proceedings for trustee to withhold timely application for discharge and await market enhancement of the value of non-exempt equity in homestead property.
In so doing, do not say that the trustee may not realize upon the value of her non-exempt equity in the homestead, but as at what date and to what extent remain open questions which can be addressed upon an application by the trustee for discharge.","A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate.

The trustee has never applied for a discharge.
The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge.
Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead.
The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her.
The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee.

While this failure to show was unfortunate, it does not change the obligation of the court with respect to the decision to be made.

J. M. T. MEGAW","HELD: The order was granted.
Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act.
As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands.
Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care.
Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","[294, 6, 3, 285, 9, 288, 289, 298, 297, 19, 13, 18, 1, 268, 269, 293]"
381,"[2] The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the Beauval Indian Residential School.
The accused had an ability to interact and bond with the people in his life.
In spite of lack of significant post-secondary education and the loss of both of his parents at the age of 15, the accused had an amazing aptitude to relate to the boys at the school in manner which brought out their talents as both athletes and singers.
[7] To most of them, the accused was the one person who seemed to care for them and with whom they bonded.
[9] However, as time progressed and the closeness of the relationships of the accused with many of the boys in his care grew closer, there became times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts which were totally inappropriate.
A conviction is entered on both counts.

By the Court:
[3] He seeks a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousal support.
The parties were married on June 3, 2000 at Cheticamp, Nova Scotia and ceased living together on June 19, 2004.
There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties.
[116] Her educational expense ought not to be the basis for assessing spousal support.
Moving to Moncton has resulted in court ordered obligation to participate in an access regime which she estimates costs her $140.00 per month.
This may in fact continue for the foreseeable future if she continues to pursue her degree in Moncton.
[121] In reviewing his financial circumstances, his disposable income, fifty percent of the after tax child care costs, the costs of transportation to him to maintain access with his son and the costs of transportation to Ms. Chiasson.
[122] This $300.00 ought to contribute towards her maintaining her car, the gas required and any incidental meals associated with ensuring that her child remains in contact with his father for the period of time that she resides in Moncton to pursue her degree.
[123] Spousal support is reviewable in the event those circumstances change.
Long term support is not called for in these circumstances.
Support is also reviewable upon change in circumstances and/or access regime.","The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage.
The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment.
The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child.
The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home.
Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs.
Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent.
Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues.
The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills.
Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity.
The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","[2, 322, 321, 0, 327, 326, 319, 11, 6, 318, 17, 306, 317]"

[3] On September 24, 2001, the R.C.M.P. officers were dispatched to trailer park at the south end of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.
The officers were told that an intoxicated male was operating brown, two-toned pick up truck.
Officers McDermid and Johnson responded to the scene.
[17] The condition the police found the accused in was nowhere near to what his wife told the court she has seen when panic attack is upon her husband.

As was stated by the court in McCallum the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide defence to the charge.
[21] I find the accused guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)).
The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack.

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving.
The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack.
The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

[21] With regard to the disclosure of settlement amounts I find that the defendant has made its case and order those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed.","The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant.
In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire.
He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001.
In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff.
The defendant filed his defence in April 2007.
Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011.
At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused.
The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit.
The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution.
The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable.
The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis.
Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference.
2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant.
3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings.
4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered.
5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control.
The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.
Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","[117, 119, 115, 116, 114, 113, 9, 5]"
386,"[1] This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment.
3. It was my belief and understanding that the receipt by way of registered mail of the Statement of Claim did not constitute proper service on myself as required by the Queen’s Bench Rules.
4. As such did not take any steps to defend the action believing that proper personal service would be made on me in due course.
[2] Queen’s Bench Rule 19(1) provides as follows:
(2) The primary consideration for the court in the exercise of its discretion is that the person served or to be served:
(See First City Capital Ltd. v. Abramson Enterprises Ltd. and Abramson (1988), 1988 CanLII 5106 (SK CA), 68 Sask. R. 281 (C.A.); Fidyk v. Saskatchewan Cycle Assoc.

[8] The plaintiff is entitled to the taxable costs of the application.","FIAT: This is an application to set aside a noting for default and the resulting default judgment.
The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The application is dismissed and the service upon the defendant by registered mail is validated.
1) Rule 19(1) of the Rules must be read in conjunction with Rule 18.
2) Queen's Bench Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002.
No authorities were available that considered its provisions.
3) Rule 18 requires the defendant to satisfy the court that he has not received notice of the document.
4) The defendant admits receiving a copy of the statement of claim by registered mail and the fact that it did not constitute valid service is of no assistance to him.","[33, 0, 30, 4, 29, 28, 6, 5, 12]"
387,"[1] The plaintiff, Maher Hanna, a medical doctor, brings this action against the defendants, Ettienne Crouse and David Kirsch, also medical doctors, alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all of them to perform the on-call services required of each of them by the defendant, Pipestone District Health Board.
Hanna is member of the Moosomin Family Clinic which he owns, and Crouse and Kirsch practise family medicine in the Moosomin Family Practice Centre which they established in 1994.
[3] All three medical practitioners were, during the period under discussion, members of the medical staff of the Moosomin Union Hospital where all retained privileges.
The Moosomin Union Hospital is general health care facility under the control of the Pipestone District Health Board.
[7] Because the arrangement was voluntary doctor choosing not to enter into the arrangement would remain on call to look after his own patients at all times, and to respond to emergencies.
[24] The first point make is that the hospital was neither the originator of the on-call arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it.
[26] The relationship between the Moosomin Union Hospital or Pipestone District Health was not compromised by the arrangement entered into by the doctors to deliver on-call services.
[28] For the foregoing reasons I dismiss Hanna's action against Crouse and Kirsch with costs to be taxed.
And I also dismiss Hanna's action against Pipestone District with costs to be taxed.","The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.
Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies.
It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic.
HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.
 1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct.
When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him.
Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital.
He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence.
He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days.
Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition.
His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors.
The on-call arrangement was voluntary.
There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood.
There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.
 4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District.
Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.
There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","[72, 71, 2, 3, 11, 68, 4, 62, 0]"
388,"For the Landlord self-represented
For the Tenant self-represented
[1] This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007.
That order allowed the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation.
In particular the Director found that the Landlord allowed mouldy conditions in the premises to develop and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the Tenant’s belongings were ruined.
The Tenant could only estimate the value of the ruined clothing, which she placed at $500.00.
She had also advanced general damages claim for inconvenience and suffering in the amount of $200.00.
[12] The Director also discounted the property damage claims on the basis that the furniture’s value should be discounted, and because of the lack of evidence of the other items.
She allowed $712.50 for the furniture and $75.00 for the rug and clothing.
Because the matter is before me on a de novo basis I assess the damages a little higher.
would allow $712.50 for the furniture, $50.00 for the area rug and $100.00 for the clothing, for total of $862.50.
Eric K. Slone, Adjudicator","The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined.
The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould.
It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting.
Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased;
the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings.
The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","[2, 1, 46, 44, 37, 43, 41, 3, 40, 4, 36, 5]"

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so.

390,"P. S. KOLENICK PCJ JUDGMENT
Review of Evidence for the Crown
At approximately 6:53 p.m., he met vehicle which matched the description in the complaint, being operated by the accused.
As well, he noted the accused’s vehicle to make an abrupt lane change twice, without signalling.
On the evidence, the accused had passed another vehicle just prior to responding to the emergency lights and stopping, which presumably resulted in the lane changes which the officer had noted.
[6] When Sgt. Mitchell first spoke to the accused behind the wheel, he was aware of strong smell of beverage alcohol in the vehicle.
She was seated in the rear driver’s side seat, and testified for the defence.
In general, he conducted himself in rational and reasonable manner.
Of course, he was not charged with an offence of being over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code, and indeed the policy of the RCMP is to charge only on results of one hundred milligrams percent or higher, unless there is motor vehicle accident in which an injury occurs.
[39] However, regardless of that alcohol consumption, and the accused’s blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.
Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused has offered a reasonable explanation for them.
Therefore, he is not guilty of impaired operation, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.","The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.
HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.
Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them.
The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted.
1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes.
His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane.
The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period.
The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2)
The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking.
Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes.
3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4)
The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5)
The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner.
If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment.
The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations.
He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour.
In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them.
6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions.
However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","[157, 158, 0, 160, 11, 3, 15, 150, 16, 7, 19, 153]"
391,"However, am also mindful that she did not deny that there could have been an open bottle of beer in the vehicle but testified that she ""doesn't recall [one]"".
4. In assessing Randy Persicke's evidence am mindful that of all the witnesses to the events of the evening in question, he had consumed the most alcohol.
He regarded the accused's driving as normal when Ross and even the accused suggested otherwise.
There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he had any reason whatsoever to taint his evidence by favouring either the Crown or the accused.
He gave his evidence in straight-forward manner without hesitation.
Where on Evidence
as Whole There is Reasonable Doubt as to
Whether the Physician Took the Sample Himself
or Supervised Technician in Taking of the Sample?
39. There is no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analyst.
Therefore, it establishes that the accused\'s blood alcohol level at the time of driving was 159 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.
40. On review of the evidence as a whole I have no reasonable doubt that the Crown has established all of the elements of the offence, I find the accused guilty as charged.","The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code.
In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving.
1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident.
2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate.
There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying.
The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient.
His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory.
There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples.
The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient.
3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required.
4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay.
The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.
 5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","[225, 226, 218, 219, 7, 224, 15, 16, 220, 9, 221, 12]"
392,"and Graham Gunningham
[1] Graham Gunningham is charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was detained by police officer at the scene.
The accused was arrested, his rights were read to him and breathalyzer demand was made.
He ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
Further, the Crown denies that the accused’s Charter rights were breached.
Cst. McAvoy complied with each request of the accused and was willing to continue attempting to contact counsel of choice, if the accused chose to do so.
[58] At trial the accused expressed concerns that his consultation with Legal Aid duty counsel was unsatisfactory.
Unless the accused diligently and reasonably indicated that the advice he received was inadequate, the officers were entitled to assume he was satisfied with his exercised right to counsel (Willier, para. 42).
This is so, particularly where the accused expressly stated that he was satisfied to Cst. McAvoy and the breathalyzer technician.
[60] In the circumstances, I find there was no breach of s. 10(b) of the Charter.
[61] have found that the ASD demand was not made forthwith, giving rise to breach of the accused’s ss. and Charter rights.
[62] For the foregoing reasons, the Certificate of Analyses will be admitted into evidence on the trial proper.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident.
The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m.
Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m.
The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel.
The accused was charged with driving over .08.
The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained.
The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.
HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed.
While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made.
2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged.
The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised.
The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[254, 243, 246, 247, 251, 250, 20, 12, 2, 9, 234, 14, 7]"

CONCLUSION It is hereby ordered that SGI\'s decision is set aside.
Although I am entitled to award interest on the benefits not paid (ss.198(4)), I grant the parties leave to bring that matter back for further argument, if required.","The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI.
At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4.
HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.
 1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1).
There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit.
S146(1) is a self-contained formula.
3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1).
The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis.
4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1).

[2] The appellant plead not guilty and the trial was held on May 17, 2004.
Following written submissions, the decision was delivered on September 27, 2004.
[23] The adjudicator fell into error by failing to address whether the appellant’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the vehicle was solely occupied.
[25] The adjudicator did not instruct himself in accordance with the test set out in R. v. W. (D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991]
First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.
Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.
[27] The adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.

The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle.

Mr. McLaughlan has properly proceeded under The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act in light of his residence and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation.
According to the evidence filed by Mr. McLaughlan, Mr. McLaughlan is earning the gross annual sum of $45,784.
Based on these earnings, Mr. McLaughlan has an obligation, according to the British Columbia Tables, to pay the sum of $425 for the one child.

2001 (Business income reported at $85,050 with income after expenses (-$34,830) no full income tax return filed to assess)
Mr. McLaughlan’s reason for failure to pay his support is as set out above.

Discussion was had as to whether there would be consent to the Minister's intention (assuming were to grant the motion) of an immediate reapprehension and consolidation of the various initial proceedings from interim hearing through protection finding and then to disposition in order to preserve the existing trial dates.
This is so only when extensions are included in an order that follows the trial.
Again the Court is emphasizing that it is the issuing of an order after trial that offends the concept of extending time limits.
To reconcile the H.W. decision with the B.F. decision on the basis argued above by counsel for the mother would be to ignore the distinction relied upon by the Court of Appeal.
In the present case, granted the time extension to the trial date.
The appropriate disposition has not been determined and after the trial, will have only two options under this statute and they are to terminate the proceedings or to make

No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties.
The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel.
Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed.
The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial.
When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act.

1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted.
It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.
 2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying.
It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor.
The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes.
He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.
 3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","[7, 0, 60, 10, 52, 8, 57, 56, 9, 51]"

399,"[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about July 10th, 2000, operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired, and also, operate a motor vehicle while over .08, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively.
He was operating marked police vehicle, and he was stopped behind vehicle at red light.
He identified the accused seated upright behind the wheel, wearing bathing suit.
He appeared to be sound asleep, or passed out.
Shortly thereafter, he was able to comprehend what was happening.
[6] On the evidence, the officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking.
""In all criminal cases the trial judge must be satisfied as to the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt before conviction can be registered.
Obviously this was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and also, its application will very much depend on the circumstances of given case.
As well, shortly thereafter, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved.
[22] Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot.
Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively.
Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt.
The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes.
HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges.
1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter.
The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means.
Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt.
2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.
The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole.
Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances.
It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes.
The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents.
The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card.
The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking.
3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment.
The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","[6, 3, 111, 103, 11, 108, 0, 113, 7, 10, 110]"

Decision: April 19, 2011
[1] On December 13, 2010 the police stopped a car driven by Candace MacDonald.
It was suspected of having been involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville.
[2] M.M. has been charged with number of offences, including robbery.
He clearly saw his assailants.
That left the black haired man.
He said that M.M. did not have black hair.
He did not say that he was not sure or that he couldn’t tell.
People who are most sure are often the least reliable.
The circumstantial evidence does not support the inference, in the absence of anything else, that Mr. Brooks was just wrong.
It does not provide an answer to what will now call the critical known unknown.
There is an inconsistency in the story that is so important that it raises a reasonable doubt.
That doubt applies to all of the charges.
It has proven that he was in vehicle, with the stolen property and the gun.
It has not proven that he was involved in the robbery and because of that there is no evidence that he knew or should have known that he was in a car with a gun or stolen property.","The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery.
A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery.
The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men.
While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger.
At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened.
Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person.
Accused found not guilty on all charges;
the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car.
Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","[200, 4, 193, 5, 201, 197, 192, 11, 15, 177, 188, 198, 187, 185, 184, 10]"
401,"He asks, if there is no proof he unlawfully harvested wood or unlawfully possessed wood, how could he be found guilty of unlawfully trafficking in it?
It needs to be noted that the acquittals on the charges of unlawfully harvesting and unlawfully possessing forest products have not been appealed.
The Charges
[5] Conservation Officer Daryl Rowland testified that his first contact with the defendant was on November 27, 2005 while on patrol in the Canwood block of the Nesbitt Provincial Forest where he encountered the defendant cutting mistletoe-diseased pine.
[6] Rowland testified that subsequent to this encounter he received reports to the effect the defendant was harvesting wood from within the Nesbitt Provincial Forest and selling it.
The defendant was in those conversations offering for sale, selling or dealing in forest products.
The fact that the transaction never was completed is irrelevant.
The offence was complete by the making of the offer.
The clear intention of the defendant was to avoid the $15.00 per cord levy the Province would have imposed.
Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000.
The defendant shall have 60 days to pay the fine and victim surcharge imposed, and in default of payment shall serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third.
He appealed his conviction.
He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge.
The Crown appealed the sentence.
The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking.
The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant.
He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land.
He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative.
If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit.
The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land.
The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted.
The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant.
The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending.
With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer.
The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands.
HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent.
It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise.
The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven.
However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality.
Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence.
The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products.
Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.
The conviction was upheld.
Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders.
The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low.
The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations.
If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","[237, 235, 15, 230, 12, 7, 4, 8, 218, 229, 228]"
402,"[1] H. H. is the mother of two children, N.S. and D.S. N.O.S. is the father of the children.
[2] D.S. was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born.
[3] H.H., the mother, is not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supports the position of N.O.S., the father, who asks that the children be returned to him in his care.
N.O.S. proposes that he will continue living with the mother H.H. and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems.
[71] I therefore find that N.S. and D.S. are children in need of protection and should, at this point, not be returned to N.O.S. or H.H.
[72] In my view, the evidence as whole indicates that the children should, given my earlier comments, not be placed in the custody of the parent under s. 37(1)(a).
[75] There will therefore be an order that the children N.S. and D.S. be placed in the custody of the Minister for period of six months.
Additionally, the conditions found at paragraph of the October 2, 2007 supervision order shall be made part of this judgment and the parents shall be subject to those conditions.","The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old.
DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born.
Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007.
Both children have been in care for most of their lives.
The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children.
The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care.
HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society.
Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement.
2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management.
The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH.
The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour.
There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future.
There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past.
The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal.
There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past.
The Court finds that the relationship is unstable.
The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship.
The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control.
There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic.
This should not be visited on the children.
HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS.
The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court.
This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3)
If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm.
While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS.
The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours.
The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so.
The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH.
4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order.
A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time.
The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","[486, 483, 6, 1, 10, 471, 11, 470]"

Disposition: Leave to Appeal Granted (Orally)
By: The Honourable Madam Justice Smith
[1] The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs which were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants.
[2] The chambers judge granted the application, finding, on the basis of affidavit evidence filed before him, that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would therefore constitute an abuse of the process of the Court.
(d) Naming the judicial centre nearest to which the property sought to be replevied is situated.
[6] have concluded that the proposed appeal in this case meets the test set out and that leave should be granted.
In light of the clear wording of Rule 407(2), the question is clearly not frivolous or vexatious.
The appeal should not unduly delay the proceedings, for it raises very narrow issue and can proceed to appeal quickly.
Most significantly, it is my view that the ruling of the chambers judge in this case raises an issue of considerable significance to the general operation of the remedy of a writ of replevin as provided in the Rules of Court, and merits consideration by this Court.
[7] Leave to appeal is granted.","The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants.
The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs.
The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned.
The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process.
The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

This agreement shall automatically renew unless either party cancels in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the renewal date.
Accordingly, such legal question, if alleged in the context of dispute under the Arbitration Act, and assuming the other jurisdictional requirements of that Act are met, is open to appellate review.
narrow scope for extricable questions of law is consistent with finality in commercial arbitration and, more broadly, with deference to factual findings.
In contrast, the identification of mixed question when appealing civil litigation judgment merely raises the standard of review (Housen, at para. 36).
47 Given these principles, question of statutory interpretation is normally characterized as legal question.
[44] In this case, the questions that HAL seeks to raise on appeal are, at best, questions of mixed fact and law.
Such proposed grounds of appeal, according to the leading authorities, are thus mixed questions, not pure questions of law.

The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.
Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","[200, 205, 209, 199, 217, 8, 11, 195, 15, 212, 191, 210]"

Brown hit the wall behind him as they went down.
(1) Would Mr. Brown have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him?
(2) Was the assault a contributing cause of the bodily harm, in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm?
While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the accused.
The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions.
26. Therefore, although I have some empathy for the accused reaction to the Brown’s cheering “kill him, kill #57"" while his son was down on the ice, provocation not being a defence, I must find this accused guilty as charged.
T.B. Bekolay, Provincial Court Judge","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed.
Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm.
The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm.
2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him.
The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm.
While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused.
It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up.
The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions.

The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece.
He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012.
The Crown then applied for a third recognizance.
An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over.
A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend.
The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code.
The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults.
He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated.
While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming.
As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years.
HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","[234, 227, 225, 233, 237, 232]"
409,"The sexual assault and touching allegations allegedly occurred between January 15, 1998 and March 31, 1999.
On one occasion she said that he “grabbed my butt”.
The accused often slept on this couch.
E.V., the complainant’s mother, said that the accused slept downstairs about two-thirds of the time.
4. The complainant, who was between the ages of 13 and 15 during the time frame in the Information, went to bed very late.
The complainant often sat and watched television at night.
She said that he would even grope at her in this way when she was coming to and from her bedroom.
They might be true.
The “blow job” request obviously happened but none of the allegations concerned oral sex and in any event the accused was drunk.
None of the complainant’s allegations involve alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be factor.
Perhaps her temper and dislike of the accused drove her to allege the behaviour against person whom she said she did not like and who she did not want living at the house.
31. In my view it would be very dangerous to convict the accused on the evidence before the court.
32. The accused is, therefore, not guilty of either count on the Information.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code.
The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts.
1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once.
His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish.
None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor.
The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.","[148, 145, 4, 144, 1, 140, 137, 8, 14, 11, 138, 17, 12]"

In 1996, the appellant was laid off from his employment and heceased making his support payments.
He remained at home to care for the child.
He used his common-law spouse’s modest insurance proceeds for living expenses and he made no payment towards the accumulated arrears of support.

[1] The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46.
The appellant was sentenced to an 18-month custody and supervision order: 12 months to be served in secured custody, followed by months of community supervision.
In addition to the release conditions pending trial, the appellant was released on judicial interim release conditions pending the disposition of this appeal, to which he has fully complied.
[101] The lapse of nearly four years between the offence and sentencing contradicts the principles that youth intervention should be timely and prompt pursuant to ss. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YJCA.
A custodial sentence at this point, five years after the offence occurred, would not serve the objectives and principles of the YCJA, including “timely intervention”, compliance with youth’s “perception of time” and imposing meaningful sanctions that promote rehabilitation and reintegration.
reinforce that offences of this nature generally merit custodial sentence to hold the offender accountable and to provide meaningful consequences for the criminal conduct.
[104] Therefore, I conclude the objectives and principles of the YCJA are best fulfilled by a sentence of 12 months of probation.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed.
The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation.
The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced.
The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one.
She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence.
The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony; 
2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference.
He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA.
The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016.
Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice.
To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","[366, 7, 367, 10, 20, 365, 370, 22, 373]"
413,"[1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.

[6] On November 9, 2010, the NPB ordered the respondent be detained in custody until the sentence expired.

[41] It should also be noted that the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan decisions as recent as March 2013 have chosen to follow the authorities and rationale as set forth herein rather than the decisions in R. v. Toulejour and R. v. Fontaine.
[42] This court does allow the appeal for the reasons set forth herein and does direct that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code.
The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act.
The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.
In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA).
The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole.
The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence.
Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012.
At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention.
These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan.
The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code.
The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012.
The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application.
The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour.
Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA.
HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed.
The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply.
Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.
The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA.

[2] We are unanimous in our opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentence must be dismissed.
[3] Your first ground of appeal was that transcripts of court proceedings in previous cases were not available to you, and that the Court would not subpoena certain witnesses whom you wished to call to give evidence on your behalf.
Finally, the accused, Lawrence Diduck, gave evidence on his own behalf at this trial.
He testified that he had had number of previous encounters and dealings with the RCMP which caused him to be fearful of them.
His evidence was that he was frustrated with and fearful of the RCMP and with the legal proceedings against him generally involving the RCMP and others and it was in these circumstances that when he received the phone message from Constable Rusty Spragg in January of 2001, he made the phone calls and left the two messages he did at the Esterhazy and Langenburg RCMP offices out of- acting out of fear, anger and frustration.
Your defence, such as it was, was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.
[6] The appeals against both conviction and sentence are dismissed.","Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him.

Conclusion In the result, the application is dismissed.
The plaintiff will have her taxable costs of the application in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants.
One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside.
Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause.
It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.
 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law.
The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province.
2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort.
Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary.
3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties.
4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity.
It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical.
This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship.
If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection.
5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.

July 22, 1999 Registrar in Bankruptcy
This discharge application involves another bankrupt who is self employed and through indifference, disregard and neglect does not pay his taxes.
This is the second bankruptcy for this bankrupt.
The sole unsecured creditor is Revenue Canada with a proved claim of just under $89,000.00 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T.
Not only does the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also does not file his returns.
The bankrupt shall pay this amount by monthly instalments of $500.00 per month commencing September 1, 1999 and continuing on the 1st of each month thereafter until paid in full.
Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arrears.
Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income would be remiss if did not offer the court’s assistance to educate the bankrupt relating to this obligation.
Accordingly, there will also be an order that during the term of the conditional order the bankrupt will be required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income tax and G.S.T. filing requirements.
The objecting creditor is entitled to costs of $400.00 payable out of the estate.
Registrar in Bankruptcy","The bankrupt was self-employed and failed to pay his taxes, owing Revenue Canada $89,000.
The trustee calculated surplus income at $435 per month and recommended a conditional order of discharge requiring the payment of $7,800.

The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents.
The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income.
Following a review of the bankrupt's financial material on file, the court ordered the bankrupt to pay $500 per month for 3 years, to make regular installment payments on his self-employment income and comply with tax filing requirements.","[1, 0, 23, 21, 22, 24, 2, 3, 7, 4, 19, 18]"

Summary: Although the parents were in conflict shared parenting was appropriate, with review date, to determine whether the conflict had been minimized.
The parent who does not have care of the children is to be provided time when the children will be available to have telephone conversation with that parent for period of 10 minutes to wish the birthday child happy birthday and engage in general conversation.
24) Telephone contact with the children for other than regular scheduled times is to be arranged between the parents as is practical given travel plans, if any, and likely availability of the children.
26) In addition to paragraph 25, the parents may change the parenting plan but to do so they must agree to the changes in writing.
28) Communications required for emergencies, to speak with child, to confirm pick up or drop off and for similar situations that do not require significant back and forth discussions, may be face to face or by way of telephone conversations.
They may do so by attending programs offered by organizations such as Family SOS, (if it provides program for parents who are separated), or by using counselor accessed through his or her workplace insurance or employee assistance program.","The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.
 The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody.
She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together.
The level of conflict between the two was high.
Each lived with new partners.
They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall.
The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support.
She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did.
Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months.
This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off.
The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated.
While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not.
The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help).
If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody.
On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children.
The father will pay child support in the set-off amount.
While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her.
It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation.
Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated.

421,"By: The Honourable Madam Justice Smith
The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
[3] The charges arise out of collision in the early morning hours of July 27, 2003, between truck owned by the appellant and car driven by Tanya Bergen.
Accordingly, the sole issue at trial was whether it was the appellant or Ms McDermott who was the driver of the truck at the time the collision occurred.
[5] When the collision occurred, the truck, occupied by the appellant and Ms McDermott, rolled completely over, landing on its wheels.
When the first witnesses arrived at the scene, Ms McDermott was lying unconscious on the ground outside the passenger side of the vehicle.
Circumstances also vary widely in terms of the manner of driving, the degree of impairment, the previous criminal record in relation to alcohol related offences and whether, by way of mitigation, the accused has accepted responsibility and shown remorse.
The respondent had previous record of five previous convictions for impaired driving in addition to other offences.
[59] This Court indicated that the appropriate range of sentences for such offences was between two and seven years imprisonment and increased the sentences imposed from four to six years, concurrent.
The sentencing judge made no error of principle and the sentence was not demonstrably unfit.","The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code.
He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand.
The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.
On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction.
He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case.
This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case.
See R. v. Underwood, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 77.
As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.
 2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'.
Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them.
Defence counsel did not object to them.
However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.
 3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction.
No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed.
This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4)
The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code.
The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a).
There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner.
5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable.
In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving.
The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence.
Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.
The appeal from conviction is dismissed.
6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment.
While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","[12, 2, 336, 9, 0, 330, 328, 333, 21, 22]"

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:
The appellant, after guilty pleas on April 17, 1990, was sentenced by Judge R. E. Kimball to eight months incarceration on each of seven counts of break, enter and theft into dwelling houses in the city of Dartmouth.
In his factum he adds a further ground: the disparity with the sentences for offences imposed upon his co‑accused, three months on each count, for a total of 21 months.
The first four of the offences occurred between February 12 and 21, 1990.
From March to 28, 1990, while awaiting sentencing set for April 17, 1990, the appellant and his co‑accused committed the other three offences.
The appellant is 22 years old, with Grade 8 education and single.
He has prior criminal record of nine convictions, including four break and enters.

423,"With respect to the offences that occurred in 2002, Mr. Gonzales refused to talk about the offences which made him ineligible for entry into high intensity sexual offender programs even though he told the sentencing judge at that time that he was willing to take the treatment.
[43] The trial judge’s view that Mr. Gonzales was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic.
On August 19, 2010, Mr. Gonzales filed a notice of appeal with this Court stating that “I am doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults I did not commit”.
[44] The fresh evidence, which was filed by consent of the parties in this Court, included correctional plan that was written in January 2012.
The document reveals that Mr. Gonzales refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in the high intensity sexual offender treatment program.
[46] One final point mentioned in the factum of Mr. Gonzales but not pressed on appeal relates to the criticism that the trial judge overemphasized specific deterrence and denunciation and overlooked rehabilitation.
These objectives were not mentioned by the trial judge.
Jackson J.A.
concur “Herauf J.A.”
Ottenbreit J.A. (as per authorization)","The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts.
Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment.
Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate.
Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar.
Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change.
In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody.
He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper.
The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence.
The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions.
In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone.
In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","[201, 202, 200, 182, 186, 193, 180, 192, 183, 185]"
424,"Decision: [1] On May 5, 2011, Mr. MacDonald applied in Chambers for interim release (bail) pending appeal of his conviction for offences relating to careless use and unlawful possession of a weapon.
[4] When Mr. MacDonald came to his door, he was holding (but did not display) loaded mm Beretta handgun.
[5] Mr. MacDonald was acquitted on four of these charges.
The latter carries minimum mandatory sentence of three years (s. 95(2)(a)(1) of the Code).
(b) that he shall attend court as and when directed
(e) that he have no direct or indirect contact or communication with Shelly Pierce and Steve Sears or other crown witnesses except through lawyer
(j) that he not play music at his premises at 207 1479 Lower Water Street, Halifax, NS, daily after 9:00 pm and at no time at volume audible outside of his condominium
(k) That he surrender into the custody of the keeper of the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility at Dartmouth, in the Halifax Regional Municipality, by one o'clock p.m. of the day preceding the day on which the appeal will be heard.
[44] am satisfied on balance of probabilities that Mr. MacDonald has established that he will comply with the foregoing terms of release.","The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal.
He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here.
The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work.
Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction.
Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions.
The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","[170, 175, 164, 0, 161, 7, 169, 12, 14]"

The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years.
The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs.
He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951.
Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew.

To reach this resolution the time which would have been consumed cross-examining the affiant at chambers hearing was instead used up in discovery.

428,"1. The issue which has been raised in these proceedings is whether it is appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application.
note that the judgment of Finlayson, J.A., in R. v. Kutynec (1992), 1992 CanLII 12755 (ON CA), 52 O.A.C. 59; 12 C.R. (4th) 152 (C.A.), states the following propositions.
This may be different for trial court which hears cases that have been through preliminary inquiry and detailed pretrial, and that regularly assigns trial judges to cases well before the date of the trial.
This surely is superior from procedural standpoint than the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire on speculation, discovering that aspects of that evidence are unfavourable and contrary, and therefore having to attempt to convince the trial judge to grant leave to cross-examine the witness.
13. I must therefore conclude that the fairness of these proceedings, as well as the public confidence in the administration of justice, are best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge as alleged, with the accused having leave to apply to have the evidence applied to the Charter issue, if it is appropriate to do so.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application.
This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition.
In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process.
This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter.
In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue.
The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire.
The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure.
If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues.
The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy.
An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application.
This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine.
It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues.
The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","[45, 0, 47, 3, 6]"

Count #4 being at large on his undertaking entered into before justice or judge and being bound to comply with condition thereof, to wit, shall keep the peace and be of good behaviour, fail without lawful excuse to comply with that condition contrary to section 145(3) of the Criminal Code.
[45] Therefore am left, having considered the totality of the evidence without any reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt on count #1.
[46] The accused, based on my finding as to the issue of communication of the complainant’s status as a police officer, on count #2, is in some doubt, and therefore the accused is entitled to be acquitted on that charge.
[48] On count #4, the accused in this case has obviously committed breach of the peace, and he will be convicted, on his prior admission of the undertaking in question, of count #4 as well.

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window.
The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer.
The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer.
1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed.
Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.
 2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other.
The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","[137, 7, 139, 134, 10, 132, 136, 11]"

Both parties testified and were subject to cross-examination.

[5] After carefully considering the record and the submissions of counsel, we are satisfied that this is case where we ought to intervene and set aside certain provisions of the order under appeal.
[8] As the parties agreed and as the judge made clear in his decision, this case presented very unique set of circumstances.
The appellant, Eileen Goyetche, was born on June 5, 1941.
The facts and history of the case are obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it.","In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home.
The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses.
The wife appealed.
Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home;
the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice.
There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","[2, 0, 11, 166, 14, 5, 15]"

After two days of hearings the matter was adjourned pending the determination of these preliminary issues.

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed.
The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

Appeal from a judgment directing matrimonial property.
The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.
The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years.
HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package.
The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination.
The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage.
The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them.
Judgment varied accordingly.","[94, 92, 3, 0, 10, 86, 11, 91, 89, 14, 13, 4, 90, 15, 78, 80, 81, 75, 85, 16, 77, 22, 26, 73, 74]"

When the child was approximately 18 months old, the minister sought permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act (The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2).
This order was granted by Meekma P.C.J. The child’s father, R.S., then appealed the order and sought to adduce fresh evidence in relation to his fitness to parent the child.
Neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report.

[12] This provision is worded very broadly.
The transition period provided for in the order is one that was recommended by the psychological report and is manifestly in the best interest of the child, who has been in the care of his foster mother since birth.
It is in my view highly doubtful that the Act should be interpreted, as counsel for the proposed appellant argues, to preclude an order returning the child to its parent’s custody with period of transition.
Nor am I satisfied that the issue is of sufficient significance either to the parties or the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W.

The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report.
HELD: Leave denied.
Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

437,"The only issue to be determined in this application is the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986.
Both parties are medical
practitioners and each enjoys significant income.
In 1996, the applicant earned
approximately $128,000.00, although she claims this was extra-
during the previous two years.
In addition to regular maintenance the applicant claims pursuant to s. 7 of the Divorce Act Regulations, SOR/97-175 (the ""Federal Child Support Guidelines""), additional maintenance to cover special or extra-ordinary expenses.
These expenses are approximately $1,200.00 per month to cover nanny and child care costs, approximately $125.00 per month for medication, $250.00 per month for recreation and $200.00 per month for a university fund for the child.
With respect to the claims for special extra-ordinary expenses I am not satisfied the applicant has established that the claims for recreation and a university fund are expenses that are ""special"" or ""extra-ordinary"".
On the basis of their respective incomes, the respondent should be responsible for approximately 2/3 of these expenses which I calculate as follows:Nanny costs $1,200.00 x 12 $14,400.00Less income tax benefit available to petitioner 3,000.00$11,400.002/3 x $11,400.00 = $7,600.00 ï¿½ 12 = $634.00Medication costs 2/3 $125.00 = 84.00$718.00.

438,"[1] The defendant, Dr. David Keegan, applies for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of this Court, or alternatively s. 50 of The Queen’s Bench Act, S.S. c. Q-1, for an order:(1) requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within thirty (30) days; and (2) requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor, which report shall be filed with the Court; and (3) staying any further proceedings in this action until a report is filed.
[2] The background to this law suit is decision of this Court in Brady v. The Public Trustee for Saskatchewan, Dr. David L. Keegan, et al., Q.B.G. No. 690/1999 which resulted in an order revoking certificate of incompetence issued on December 18, 1998 with respect to the plaintiff, James Brady.
[18] With respect to the applicant’s request in the alternative that the Court order an examination pursuant to s. 50 of The Queen’s Bench Act, the section provides:
This legislation does not apply to this application.
[19] The application is dismissed.
[20] The plaintiff is entitled to his costs of the application in any event of the cause.
[21] Order accordingly.","FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed.
The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate.
The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
 1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit.
A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian.
This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented.
A stay was refused.
 2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate.
3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.

439,"3) The Canadian Federation of Students (“CFS”) is federal non-share capital non-profit corporation which, among other things, advocates on behalf of university students across Canada.
5) Under the CFS constitution, any organization wishing to join it must hold referendum in accordance with CFS rules and procedures for referenda.
However, it was clear at that USC meeting that there was not unanimity among the council members regarding the question.
However, they remind the Court that the Elections Board is creature of the USSU and as result its function could be changed by the USC.
The applicant replies that such power does not permit the USC to change the Elections Board function from critical last step to meaningless final charade.
62) In this case, it is instructive to reflect upon the USC’s reaction to the report of the Elections Board and the inconvenient truths noted therein.
The USC’s response to the report was to ignore the very process it created to ensure there was fair referendum.
64) Accordingly, I conclude that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.
The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.
The portion am willing to grant is limited to the effect of the referendum.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services.
The result favoured joining the federation.
The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum.
HELD: 1)
The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable.
In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations.
In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice?
This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues.
The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer?
2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice.
When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome.
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.
The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.
The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","[239, 238, 245, 243, 244, 9, 4, 21, 226, 225]"

C-12.01, as am. (the “Act” or “Sask. Act”) now represented by an amended Statement of Claim filed with the court November 7, 2008 (“Claim”).
[2] The applicants submit that this action and these proceedings are an abuse of the court’s process and that the court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed.
[3] The plaintiff, Frank Brooks, commenced his class action in Saskatchewan when this court issued his original Claim on June 12, 2006 (the “Sask. Action”).
As have concluded, these amendments directly and conclusively answer the question as to when the various and important considerations raised by the stay applications presented to this court should appropriately be considered namely, at the certification application stage.
That alone, without the assistance of s.6 and the other amending provisions of the Sask. Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that that action should appropriately (but conditionally) be stayed.","FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act.
The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.
The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick.
To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG).
MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent.
Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference.
Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced.
The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process.
They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money.
The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick.
The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process.
HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed.
1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.
 'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act.
The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications.
They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses.
The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad.
That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act.
That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction.
The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act.
The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed.
They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted.
2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case.
There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions.
That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","[3, 1, 138, 5, 135]"

The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears.
It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately one-half of the $300.00 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992.
However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable.
By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.
In the circumstances I am not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.
There will be no order as to costs.","In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party.
As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900.
He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears.
The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines.
HELD: 1)
In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934.
The petitioner is actively engaged in farming.
He pursues reasonable off farm income.
In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income.
He shall pay child support of $221 per month.
 2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation.
It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992.
However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it.
He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.
The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.
By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.
In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","[2, 4, 0, 3, 53, 51, 50, 47, 46]"

17 of the amended claim).
Paragraph 16 of the amended claim states:
[56] Since I have granted the defendants’ summary judgment application, I do not need to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification.
(Alves 116; Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62 (CanLII), 299 Sask. R. 298 (Sask. C.A.))
65 Roberts Properties Inc. v. Saskatchewan Power Corp., 2014 SKQB 245 (CanLII) (Sask. Q.B.) is the most recent decision where this issue arose.
92 Although the reasoning in Campbell, supra, is interesting, the Saskatchewan jurisprudence establishes that s. 40 of The Class Actions Act does not operate to prohibit an award of costs, where separate application is considered by the court prior to certification, even if they are argued at the same time. In the Alves trilogy (2011 SKCA 116, 2011 SKCA 117 (CanLII) and 2011 SKCA 118 (CanLII)), there were several applications in the larger context of class action proceeding that were heard before the certification application, but after the motion or certification was filed and served, and while the certification motion was before the court.
Justice Richards made it clear that s. 40 did not constitute bar to awarding costs in such circumstances.
66 The within application is clearly pre-certification and not directly tied to the certification hearing.
In regards to the certification hearing, prefer not to order any costs although that application was heard in its entirety.","HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants.
It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification.
The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages.
The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence.
There was no genuine issue requiring a trial.
The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.

HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing.
Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same.
2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing.
Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable.
A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures.
Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt.
This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346.
It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered.
The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction.
This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment.
3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.
 4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake.
It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him.
The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail.
This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least.
Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default.
In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","[4, 177, 185, 1, 8, 174, 178]"

Between: Dennis Ens and Anne Ens
and Pacific Home Products Ltd.
Lynne Greenhorn For the Plaintiff
JUDGMENT D.M. ARNOT,
[1] Dennis and Anne Ens wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home in Warman, Saskatchewan.
[2] Mr. Goertzen attended the Ens home in early April, 2004.
He had discussion to ensure he knew what the Ens’ expected.
The total cost to the Ens was to be $11,847.53.
The Ens accepted the quote and contract was made to supply and install sunroom at the Ens home.
[33] find the total loss proven in evidence to Pacific Home Products Ltd. is as follows:
a) Sunroom material $5,529.13
b) Shipping costs 400.00
c) Building permit 80.25
e) Design and drawing labour 500.00
Subtotal $6,782.23
35% apportioned to Dennis Ens and
Anne Ens $2,023.78
[35] find that the Defendant Pacific Home Products Ltd. is required to pay the sum of $176.22 to the Plaintiff, Ens’ being the balance between the deposit of $2,200.00 received on May 05, 2004 and the apportionment of damages pursuant to the Frustrated Contracts Act, as have assessed it.
[36] Therefore I award judgment in favour of the Plaintiff Ens’ against the Defendant Pacific Home Products Ltd. in the amount of $176.22.","The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home.
They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years.
The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom.
The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom.
This provision was fundamental element in the contract.
The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term.
The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.
 The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit.
The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13.
HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22.
In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.
Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated.
The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract.
It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party.
The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract.
The event was permanent and non-transient.
The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended.
The difference was much more than mere inconvenience.
The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them.
Both parties acted in good faith.
The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract.
The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract.
The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities.
Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss.
The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane.
The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely.
The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project.
Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","[4, 6, 183, 172, 0, 171, 11, 7, 170, 3, 181, 175, 180, 174, 2, 12, 182, 1, 15, 16, 169]"

I. Introduction
[1] This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Carlos Huerto and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.
He ultimately commenced an action in the Court of Queen’s Bench to compel payment of his accounts.
With one small exception, the claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature.
[5] I conclude, for the reasons set out below, that both the appeal and the cross-appeal must be dismissed.
[8] Most physicians opt for the third approach.
This led the Supreme Court to characterize the labour field as involving comprehensive statutory schemes designed to govern the relationships between employers and employees in that setting.
In the present case, s. 40(3) expressly preserves the right to resolve disputes in court and thereby stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the MCIA should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.
Given that the Government’s arguments on these two points have not succeeded, the trial judge’s decision must stand.
Creative thinking might reveal other useful approaches for expeditiously sorting out the points in contention between them.
Wilkinson J.A.","This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.
Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts.
The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided.
The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information.
He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts.
His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature.
The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success.
HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.
 1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'.
This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians.
The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts.
Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant.
The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule.
The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services.
This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'.
Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service.
This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service.
A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things.
3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act.
It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations.
An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code.
An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded.
These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment.
4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board.
The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts.
It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","[338, 9, 320, 10, 332, 13, 4, 17, 319, 324, 5, 0]"

The wife could find employment but at a rate at or near minimum wage.
She had no motivation to work, having convinced herself that there was no work available and that her health did not permit it.

448,"[1] The plaintiff’s action is for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice.
The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen’s Bench Rules.
At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff’s witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect questions from plaintiff’s counsel.

The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998.
The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period.
Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause.
Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time.

Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to re- apply.

thereto. However, there shall be no other costs on either of
the two motions.","1)Application by plaintiffs (defendants by counterclaim) for an order setting aside the default judgment, writ of execution and 2)garnishee summonses issued against them.
3)Application by respondents (plaintiffs by counterclaim) for payment out of the monies garnisheed.
HELD: 1)Application allowed.
At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim.
However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors.
The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim.
The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.
The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents.
2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed.
There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act.
The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside.
It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application.
3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed.
Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant.

While there, his mother paid his grandmother $400.00 each month for room and board and she gave Michael an allowance.
[3] In July, 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to larger, more expensive apartment on the east side, to accommodate what he understood to be Michael’s interest in moving in with him and Jerrilyn, Michael’s older sister.
In September, 2006, Michael moved in with his father and Jerrilyn.

Accordingly, for the purposes of s. 7, the mother’s income is $25,672.37.
The father’s income is $108,629.49.
The support order is based on the father’s income at that time of $87,794.00.
In addition, the father will pay $284.00 each month, beginning December 1, 2007, for the s. 7 expenses, until further order, or for as long as Michael and Jessica remain children within the meaning of the Divorce Act.
[20] The mother seeks costs for two court appearances, before this was set down for trial, when she was represented by counsel.
The mother is entitled to costs in the amount of $500.00, payable forthwith.","The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991.
A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held.
HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son.
This is a period of no more than 5 months.
Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother.
The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.
 2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629.
The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3)
The parties have been divorced since 1998.
The son has played baseball since 2004.
The daughter has speed skated since 2001.
The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father.
It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses.
Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him.
To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.
 4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines.
The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually.
The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.
The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription.
The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%.
Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5)
Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes.
The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794.
His income is considerably higher now.
His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","[137, 132, 136, 9, 135, 122, 123, 7, 124, 12, 10]"
458,"Judge(s): Chipman, Oland Hamilton, JJ.A.
Counsel: Joseph MacDonell Kerri-Ann Robson, for the Appellant
Restriction on publication: Pursuant to s. 94(1)
Reasons for judgment:
We do not know how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her present job.
Without the adoption the child’s legal relationship with her father is governed by the Maintenance and Custody Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.160.
[21] The appellant did not satisfy us, on the meagre facts available to the chambers judge, that he failed to properly take into account the applicable enumerated factors set out in s.3(2) or that he placed too much emphasis on the child’s potential relationship with her father in reaching his conclusion as to whether the proposed adoption was in the best interests of the child.
It is clear from his decision that the chambers judge understood that the primary consideration in an application for adoption is the best interests of the child and that he identified and weighed several factors in deciding this.
His comment that ""knowing your natural parents is benefit"" was not determinative.
He made no reversible error in exercising his discretion in refusing to grant the adoption.
[22] Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
Concurred in:","The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father.
The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years.
The mother appealed.,
appeal dismissed;
the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act.
He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","[88, 5, 1, 87, 91, 92, 90, 6, 89, 78, 11, 22]"
459,"During portion of 2002, Mr. Lionel Russell, who is not partner in Triple Auto Repair (hereinafter referred to as “Triple R”), was engaged in the business of consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R, with Triple R’s knowledge and consent.
It is noted that in the ordinary course of events, purchaser would not see the consignment agreement.
This is the essence of consignment relationship.
Once the Plaintiff became aware of the seriousness of the problems, particularly with the engine mount, he proceeded with dispatch.
I find that in the circumstances, the Plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period.
Subsection 60(c) contemplates compensation to the vendor for same.
In my view an equitable amount is $.06 per kilometre, amounting to $300.
Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s judgment is reduced by this sum, such that the final figure is $1542.35.
[33] Upon payment of this sum, the Plaintiff will execute such bill of sale in respect of this vehicle in favour of the Defendant.
Once the judgment has been paid in full, the Plaintiff will execute bill of sale in respect of the subject vehicle in favour of the Defendant.
[36] Dated this 28th day of February, 2003.
David J. Kaiser, P.C.J.","The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b).
Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600.
The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'.
The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on.
The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement.
Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair.
The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts.
At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act.
HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven.
1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA.
If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group.
Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive.
It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality.
The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so.
The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation.
It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time).
3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character.
4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period.
The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product.
The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","[187, 190, 181, 186, 176, 192, 2, 191, 185, 13, 175, 6]"

have read the affidavits on file as well as the briefs submitted by counsel.
as well heard Counsel representing both sides in oral argument at the chambers hearing for this application.
[2] Civil Procedural Rule 13.01 states as follows:
(a) there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the claim or any part thereof;
(c) the only arguable issue to be tried is as to the amount of any damages claimed.
As well there are questions in her claim for loss of valuable service as to whether or not the amount claimed is appropriate when the plaintiff stated in discovery she was able to do some housework and in fact did so.
It must be recalled that under the legislation the onus is on the plaintiff to prove any injuries she sustained are not minor in nature.
[26] However, as I said before, I would order summary judgment be entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed.
[27] Each party having been partially successful, would order no costs to either side.
[28] Order accordingly.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment.
The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered.
The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working.
Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle.
However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","[0, 103, 5, 4, 99, 105, 93, 6, 3, 8, 104, 10]"
461,"[1] This is a summary conviction appeal from a judgment dated September 17, 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000.00 and prohibited him from driving for one year.
[2] The grounds of appeal as set out in the notice of appeal are:
1. The learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count in convicting the appellant of operating motor vehicle while impaired;
[3] The appellant is senior member of the Saskatoon Police Service.
Two on‑duty Saskatoon Police Service officers, Cst. Bzdel and Cst. Noesgaard, were notified, and they attended at the scene.
[31] In the case of R. v. Bigsky, 2006 SKCA 145 (CanLII), [2007]
The standard of appellate review derived from this section is “whether the verdict is one that properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.”
See: R. v. Yebes [1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987]
Similarly, in Burns [1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994]
The learned trial judge made no palpable or overriding error to justify overturning his decision:
R. v. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987]","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations.
The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force.
The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth.
In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.
The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer.
He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer.
The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses.
The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation.
The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer.
There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.
The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b).
Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause.
While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment.
The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected.
The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato.
There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","[165, 167, 4, 172, 164, 1, 160, 3, 10, 173, 8]"

They separated on October 18, 2004 after which the Petitioner petitioned for divorce and the Respondent filed Counter-Petition.

7. For all the reasons stated above, the Petitioner would appear to provide better role model for the children than the Respondent.
He shall therefore have reasonable access to the children including access to the children every second weekend from Friday after school to the following Sunday at approximately 7:00 p.m..
In addition, he shall have access to the children one weekday evening from after school until approximately 8:00 p.m. on day to be agreed upon by the parties and provided such access does not interfere with their ability to complete their homework assignments.
In addition, with the consent of the Petitioner, he may spend additional time with the children in order to ensure their attendance at their various soccer games, practices and tournaments provided such access does not interfere with the Petitioner’s relationship with the children.
[49] The parties’ time with the children during the children’s Christmas vacation from school shall be shared approximately equally.
If the parties are unable to agree on the specifics of such access am prepared to hear their proposals and make ruling.
[51] am prepared to hear both parties on the issue of costs after the evidence on all corollary issues has been heard.","Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue.
The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children.
Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices.
The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence.
Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother;
until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent.
Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","[272, 2, 279, 273, 3, 278, 0, 281, 263, 274]"

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial.
The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province.
He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails.

The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial,
that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction.
It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act.
The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires.
The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence.
The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","[0, 66, 1, 68, 67, 70, 3, 2, 4, 65, 61, 6, 62, 5]"

They propose to appeal essentially on the basis the award was punitive and inordinately high.
It did not contain an affidavit but did detail the expenses, fees and hours of work, some of which will be used at the new trial.
Because there was no affidavit as claimed the proposed appellants argue there was no evidentiary foundation for the award and asked for rehearing of the application.
[4] The parties have not taken out the order and thus have maintained jurisdiction to decide the matter.
[5] Having read the material and the relevant portions of the Queen’s Bench file I am still of the view the proposed appellants would have little chance of success on appeal.

469,"DATE OF DECISION: June 26, 1991 (Oral)
J. Davies, Esq., for the respondent
TRIAL DIVISION
Registrar NATHANSON, J.: (Orally)
The applicant is the owner of certain lands concerning which he has informed the Registrar of Condominiums of his intention to seek registration pursuant to the Condominium Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.85.
The structure sought to be registered as a condominium has been completed and does not physically encroach upon the right‑of‑way.
""In this Act, encumbrance means claim that secures the payment of money or the performance of any other obligation, and includes mortgage or lien.""
But there is no security aspect to a right‑of‑way and, therefore, a right‑of‑way is not an encumbrance as defined in s. 3(1)(o) of the Act.
In that decision, there are two interesting sentences, on page 77, as follows:
""I am unable to find that would have any right to insist that the Registrar requires their consent.
In the result, the Court is prepared to issue a declaration in favor of the applicant and pointing out to the Registrar of Condominiums that consent is not required of users of rights‑of‑way over servient tenements.
The applicant will have its costs of this application in the amount of Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($750.00).

The applicant sought a declaration that the consent of the adjacent landowner was not required.
Granting the application,
that the word 'encumbrance' as defined in s.3(1)(o) of the Act involves a security feature and as there is no security feature to a right of way, unlike a mortgage or lien, it is not an encumbrance.

unlawfully cause the death of Bert Haverkort, and did thereby commit second degree murder, contrary to Section 235 of the Criminal Code.
[4] While the Court has great sympathy for the family of Bert Haverkort and understanding of their plight in not being able to attend all or none of the trial for personal reasons including financial, the Court has concluded that it must dismiss this application due to the serious concerns it has in granting the order being requested.
It is distinct courtroom in another province over which this Court has no jurisdiction or control.

472,"[1] On February 8, 2005, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor‑client basis.
[2] The defendants filed statement of defence on March 7, 2005, and in paragraph thereof pled the following:
(a) Judgment in the amount of $214,600.00 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum from March 6, 2005 to the date of judgment.
Finally, the plaintiff points to the fact that in the interim, there has been no response to the undertakings which were given on the occasion of the cross‑examination.
Further, the plaintiff is entitled to interest in accordance with the Share Agreement at the rate of 16 percent from March 6, 2005, and the plaintiff shall have judgment for this principal amount and interest against the defendant Peak Enterprises Inc.
[31] have considered the matter of costs as requested by the plaintiff, and am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to her costs of the application and of the cross‑examination on July 22, 2005.
In the absence of this information, am of the view that the appropriate award of costs to the plaintiff is that the plaintiff receive costs in an amount of double Column in Schedule “B”, being the tariff of costs in the Court of Queen’s Bench.
This order as to costs is made pursuant Rule 545(3)(e).","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation.
The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules.
It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought.
The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation.
HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares.
Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment.
The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution.
Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.
The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005.
The principal amount of her shares is $214,600.
It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment.
Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court.
The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act.
2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation.
The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings.
Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable.
3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129.
The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129.
Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement.
4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants.
5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","[0, 4, 169, 167, 8, 170, 157, 20]"

The grounds for appeal as stated in the Notice of Appeal are:

[2] The particulars of the error or failure as set out in the appellant’s Notice of Appeal are:
1. The Adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small Claims Court had jurisdiction to hear the application of the respondent for review of rental increase.
It is respectfully submitted that the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court sitting on an Appeal of an Order of the Director of Residential Tenancies does not have the jurisdiction to grant Declaratory Relief.
[3] In his brief, counsel for the appellant, Killam Properties Inc., raised three issues:
3. Does an Adjudicator have the jurisdiction to grant Pure Declaratory Relief?
[19] The right to appeal final decision of Small Claims Court adjudicator on an issue involving residential tenancies is still open to be brought to this court.
This is simply ruling given during the course of hearing.
It is not final order or determination made by Small Claims Court adjudicator.
It is not the same as an appeal to our court which relies on the record from the court below.","A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase.
He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits.
The appellant appealed.
At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature.
There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding.
Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator.
The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature.
There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made.
Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination.
There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.","[4, 0, 5, 97, 10, 7, 92, 93, 8, 14, 11, 87]"

In the application she identified herself as second year Bachelor Arts student with major in history and she set out her experience.

The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve.
At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment.
It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her.
In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.
Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.

[85] At the same time the judge recognized the disadvantage Mr. Oickle was under trying to get full financial information from the Company while it continued to be controlled by Mr. Bunnell and Ms. Fraser.

The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company.
The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action.
The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites.
The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required.

Appeal dismissed;
there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.

482,"[1] The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride), prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and other conditions.
The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age.
[2] The plaintiffs’ motion for certification seeks an order appointing John-Paul Field as representative plaintiff for the class.
(2) The costs of any cross-examination under subrule (1) shall be borne by the party applying for the cross-examination.
Rather, the proposed common issues are carefully confined to whether Paxil was an ineffective treatment for persons under 18 years of age and whether GSK “is liable to account to any of the class members on restitutionary basis for any part of the proceeds of the sales of Paxil”.
[24] Counsel for the applicant, GSK, has assured the court that the proposed cross-examination of Mr. Field is expected to take no more than half day and that it will be conducted at any reasonable location chosen by Mr. Field and plaintiffs’ counsel.
The application for leave to cross-examine him on his affidavit is granted.
It will take place at such date, time and place as may be agreed upon between counsel or as will be further ordered by the court.

HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings.
None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim.
Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application.
The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release.

The plant was intended to be used mainly to produce barrels of pickled salted herring for sale to Russia and eastern European countries.
The applicant protests that this is new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Commissioner or the Minister, and is not proper consideration on appeal.

TRIAL DIVISION
BETWEEN: CONTINENTAL SEAFOODS LIMITED
and THE MINISTER OF FINANCE
DECISION OF JUSTICE KELLY","The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act.
The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.'
The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures.
The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product.
For the plaintiff,
that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","[0, 2, 4, 3, 103, 99, 7, 102, 100, 97, 83, 96, 92, 101, 91, 88, 9, 5, 87, 16, 79]"
485,"1. Jonathon Stephen Abrametz stands charged that on or about the 16th day of December, 1998 at Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan, he: (1) - did while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to Section 255(1) and Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code; (2) - did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred milliliters of blood have the care or control of a motor vehicle contrary to Section 253(b) and Section 255(1) of the Criminal Code.
2. At trial, there was only one witness, Cst. Roland Schmidt, an 18 year member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police currently stationed with the North District Highway Patrol working out of Prince Albert.
The officer observed that the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it’s license plate in violation of S. 27(5) of the Highway Traffic Act.
He asked the driver why he had not stopped.
It might be noted that s. 40(8) was enacted following, among others, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Hufsky, [1998]","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1).
The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached.
In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop.
HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08.
A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary.
1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada.
When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated.
The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another.
Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation.
The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers.
2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles.
The R. v. Emke decision is outdated.
3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty.
There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","[7, 1, 0, 10, 171]"
486,"AND IN THE MATTER OF ALLEGED OFFENCES
CONTRARY TO S. 155 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE
Judgment B.D. HALDERMAN, P.C.J.
D.N.A. Warrant Applications
[2] Three Informations in Support, each essentially identical, have been sworn by an RCMP officer.
There is no other bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incest.
That problem is whether the facts as alleged fall within and meet the requirements of s. 487.05(1) of the Code.
The custodial parent or parents are in my view in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby’s blood.
[25] In the result, I am of the view that a DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised.
No application for sealing order has been made, and do not presently perceive any possibility that publication will adversely impact on any ongoing investigation or otherwise compromise source.
If the RCMP or the reviewing prosecutor consider that publication of this judgment should be delayed, the Court clerk should be so notified not later than p.m. on March 15, 2002 so that the matter of publication may be addressed further.","The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code.
Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result.
The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155.
The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation.
'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable.
Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed.
Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a).
2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations.
The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable.
There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking.
The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out.
The paragraphing format was confusing.
3)A DNA warrant application would be premature.
The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood.
It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained.
It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","[1, 0, 109, 111, 105, 4, 102, 14, 2, 7, 12]"
487,"Between: Her Majesty the Queen
and Karyn Mae Fayant
Appearing: Mr. Rob Parker For the Crown
Background [1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar.
The major issue for determination is whether the accused can be convicted of the charge of aggravated assault, or whether she should be convicted of one of the lesser and included offences.
[3] On the way to Mossbank, the accused purchased some alcohol.
According to him, the accused became quite drunk and suggested that the two of them go for walk.
The Court stated that in order to sustain convictions under these sections, there must be an unlawful act and that the act must be an objectively dangerous act.
[23] In the case of R. v. Godin, 1994 CanLII 97 (SCC), [1994]
S.C.R. 484, the Court adopted very similar position with respect to aggravated assault under s. 268 of the Code.
The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring.
This result flows from the decisions of the Court in R. v. DeSousa and R. v. Creighton.
As a result, I must conclude that Ms. Fayant is guilty of the charge of aggravated assault.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief.
The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder.
The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later.
The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument.
The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist.
In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember.
The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window.
HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault.
The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.
The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim.
When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result.
The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","[132, 1, 2, 124, 123, 7, 14, 122, 128, 6, 3, 12, 129]"
488,"[2] Mr. Leahey, counsel for the plaintiffs, submitted that costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial.
[3] On behalf of the defendant, Mr. Fichaud contended that the defendant was justified in contesting the plaintiff's claim as it did and that it did not unduly prolong the proceeding.
[8] Under paragraph (j), however, the court may consider any other matter relevant to the question of costs.
In my opinion, the reasonable cost to successful party to obtain recovery of just claim is relevant matter.
Here it appears that it will cost the plaintiffs $21,663.48 in legal fees to recover $29,150.00.
However, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to expend this amount in order for them to recover the money they had lost through no fault of their own, which in their circumstances was not an insignificant amount.
[9] I have concluded, therefore, that it is appropriate to go outside the tariffs in determining what is a reasonable amount for the defendant to contribute to the plaintiffs\' costs.
[10] Accordingly, fix the plaintiffs costs at $11,213.16, including disbursements.","Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant.
Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725.
The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial.
Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000.
Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements;
there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","[31, 28, 1, 3, 25, 27, 24, 23]"
489,"The applicants’ horses were moved up in the standings and as result were entitled to greater portion of the purse.
Based on the commissioner’s interpretation of the legislation, only the associations and the employer were entitled to participate in the investigation.
In my view, the decision of the commissioners and the Labour Court rests on an interpretation of s. 32 L.C. which is not patently unreasonable.
In Bibeault, the employees were represented by an employees’ association and therefore it would not be necessary for the employees to be separately represented.
The court went on to state that the basic principles of natural justice require that tribunal shall be impartial and that the parties concerned shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
CONCLUSION [35] In this case the Commission has failed to discharge its duty to act fairly when it failed to give the applicants any notice of the hearing and also failed to give them any opportunity to make submissions.
Here, as the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants, a miscarriage of justice has occurred.
The application is allowed and the decision of the Commission is quashed.
[36] The applicants are entitled to the costs of their application.","An application for a judicial review of a decision by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Commission which held that the veering to the left by the two horses was within the tolerance of interference at the gate for two year olds.
The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place.
In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants.
The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard.
HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed.
The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants.
1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.
 2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record.
The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.
 3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.
The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual.
5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions.
The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable.
Their rights were affected by the decision.
Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","[136, 138, 135, 133, 6, 132, 127, 129, 122]"
490,"[3] The Respondent C.M.S. (biological father) opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to his care.
The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as party by Order dated September 15, 2005.
The mother does not trust the agency's interventions because of her past experiences.
[6] The child was apprehended in April 2004 because of unsafe and unhealthy living conditions in April 2004.
There were two dogs and cat in the apartment.
(c) the child has been or will be placed with person who does not wish to adopt the child; or
Therefore, the Court finds that an Order for access is not appropriate with respect to the mother and psychological father.
The biological father's circumstances and parenting capacity could have been assessed prior to the final hearing in October but he was unable to participate until September 2005.
While the father was tardy in seeking relationship with the child there was still plenty of time between February and September for his circumstances and capacity to be assessed.
Access between the child and the father will be in the discretion of the Agency and will allow the child and the father to be viewed by the Assessor.","The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents.
Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care.
The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions.
The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses.
The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child.
The mother was against this plan.
The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father.
Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father.
The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him.
Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own.
The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","[10, 438, 433, 14, 11, 19, 435, 423, 429, 23]"
491,"[1] This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties.
The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward.
[2] On May 12, 2005, the University of Regina Faculty Association filed grievance on behalf of Dr. Blair Stonechild who is First Nations University faculty member.
The symposium was an initiative of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and although the event was held on campus, the University itself was not directly involved.
It was drawn into the controversy between Dr. Stonechild and the Federation in circuitous way.
In that capacity, she was instrumental in the planning and organization of the symposium and it was she who invited Dr. Stonechild to participate as speaker.
The question for the reviewing court is whether the reasons as whole support the decision.
The First Nations University of Canada is unique institution in both philosophy and mandate and, as such, has distinct responsibility to safeguard and promote academic freedom.
Thus it reached the conclusion which have already quoted.
The decision meets the reasonableness test.
[17] The application is dismissed with costs.
J. C.R. Wimmer","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties.
The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom.
The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved.
After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn.
The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention.
When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member.
No decision was reached at that meeting.
The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer.
The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement.
Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.
The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement.
The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test.
The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement.
The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","[79, 76, 2, 1, 5, 70, 0, 8, 6, 80, 81, 67]"

Appeal: From: Provincial Court
Written Reasons: November 18, 2004
The Court: The Honourable Mr. Justice Vancise
The Court (orally)
[1] Mr. Roberts was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
CIBC Visa lost the entire $24,000.00.
[3] For the Court to exercise its discretion to grant discharge under s. 730 of the Criminal Code, the Court must consider that that type of disposition is: (i) in the best interests of the accused: and (ii) not contrary to the public interest.
[9] We are of the view that the learned Provincial Court judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1).
conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in Mr. Roberts’ situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity.
See: R. v. Wileniec (S.) (2003), 2003 SKCA 111 (CanLII), 238 Sask. R. 214 (C.A.).
This was a serious fraud accomplished by virtue of what the Provincial Court judge called “a rather intricate kiting system.”
It involved total of $24,000.00 which amount was lost by CIBC Visa.
This offence was significant and should attract criminal record.
[12] In the result, leave to appeal is granted and twelve month conditional sentence is substituted in place of the conditional discharge.
The restitution order will remain in place.","The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000.
The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service.

1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code.

The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats.
The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability.
The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years.

The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place.

The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the renewed release on three months notice during the term of the lease if they were unhappy with the rental increase.
The respondents objected to the rental increase and made application to the Halifax and County West Residential Tenacies Board (the Board) for determination as to whether or not that increase was valid.

The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had.
HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed.
1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted.
He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement.
The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.

iv) An interlocutory injunction until trial of this action restraining the Defendants, Garry Huntington, Robert Brennan and Brennan Educational Supply Ltd., from soliciting, directly or indirectly, the employees of Danka Canada Inc., from soliciting, directly or indirectly the customers of Danka Canada Inc. in respect of the sale or lease of photocopiers, printers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines and from performing any service work for customers of Danka Canada Inc. in respect of any machines that were sold or leased to the user by Danka Canada Inc.
[2] The relief so claimed has undergone modification from that asserted in the amended statement of claim as well as from that sought in the notice of motion.
[30] To grant injunctions against the respondents in the form requested by Danka, would be tantamount to granting final judgment against them all before trial and consequently for this reason as well an injunction is not an appropriate remedy.
[31] These alleged wrongs are simply not substantiated in any way by the evidence.
The best that could be said of the plaintiff’s case is that it is one of conjecture and inference without any foundation of facts from which inferences may be drawn.
[32] For all the foregoing, the application for injunctive relief is denied with costs.","The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff.
HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow.
These are those reasons. 1)
The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines.
The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business.
2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired.
The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients.
3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice.
The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice.
4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants.
The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods.
5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","[4, 179, 0, 178, 176, 5, 173]"

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The obligation to disclose is not absolute.

500,"[1] The Bank of Montreal (the “Bank”) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite Inc. (“Patchrite”) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to Sweeprite Mfg. Inc. (“Sweeprite”).
The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2 (the “PPSA”).
[3] Sweeprite was incorporated by Leslie Hulickso in January of 1985 and it commenced business as an equipment manufacturing company specializing in the manufacture of commercial street and parking lot sweepers.
Patchrite was also incorporated by Mr. Hulickso, in May of 1990, for the purpose of manufacturing and marketing pothole patching machines.
That case involved mortgagee who became owner of the land, building and restaurant equipment in the building as result of foreclosure upon its mortgage.
[27] Ultimately Patchrite and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease dated May 23, 2002, for term of three years, term which, by virtue of the agreement, began running January 31, 2003.
[28] In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, Patchrite had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite.
Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry Patchrite’s claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank.","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite.
By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease.
This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act.
HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act.
The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration.
Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank.
1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment.
The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement.
Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent.
Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years.
2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite.
It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way.
3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","[94, 97, 7, 8, 102, 86, 2, 1]"

The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice.
The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files.
The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client.
The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years.
Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid.
The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.
The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","[218, 4, 213, 224, 223, 217, 32, 29, 14, 18, 225, 5]"

[2] On August 28, 2002, the applicant was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving contrary to sections 253(b) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code.
The applicant, represented by counsel, entered not guilty plea and requested “the first available date for trial,” and was given the date December 18, 2003.
Like other specific guarantees provided by s. 11, this paragraph is primarily concerned with an aspect of fundamental justice guaranteed by s.7of the Charter.
There is duty on the Crown to bring the accused to trial.
It cannot be said that he deliberately or otherwise was attempting to escape trial on the merits.
Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of Breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intention to raise s. 8 and s.9 Charter motions and lead evidence to the contrary, I find that prejudice can be, and is, inferred on the basis that the length of the delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered, given the passage of time that has occurred since the circumstances giving rise to the charges.
The prejudice is such that it can not be remedied in any other way than by entering stay of proceedings.
Accordingly, the proceedings are stayed.
Judge of the Provincial Court","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time.
There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial.
Stay of proceedings granted.
At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts.
Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","[0, 6, 110, 113, 4, 111, 98, 20, 93, 105]"

1. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order dated January 9, 2014, as amended by the order dated October 30, 2014 [Order], is dismissed.
[66] Given that there has been mixed success on these related applications, there shall be no order as to costs.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8
The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim.
ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants.
The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs.
Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt.
ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act.
The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied.
Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff.
The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014.
The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA.
The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim.
If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000.
HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted.
The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed.
The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs.
The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice.
The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay.
The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.
 The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim.
The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order.
The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","[331, 1, 17, 9, 6, 322, 335, 5]"
505,"[1] On August 9, 2006 Mr. Lundrigan was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.
The Crown appeals both conclusions and asks this court to set aside the acquittal and order new trial.
[2] On April 16, 2005 two officers in separate patrol cars were travelling on Highway 47 northbound towards the Trans-Canada Highway.
It was now on grid road just off Highway 47.
She saw the vehicle out of the corner of her eye as she was passing the grid road turnoff.
As requested by his partner, he turned onto the grid road and pulled up behind the stopped vehicle.
He then asked the driver about the can of beer on the floor and was told “Oh, that must be old; it must of been there couple of weeks.”
In both cases, the officers did not know when the driver had taken his or her last drink.
Whether or not Mr. Lundrigan had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.
Likewise, whether the wet ground near the driver’s side of the vehicle was just urine is also speculation.","The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.
The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated.
The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand.
HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.
A new trial is ordered.
 1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test.
In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene.
Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2)
The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3)
The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'.
Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame.
Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","[118, 4, 0, 3, 14, 9, 19, 10, 125, 126]"

First, as mentioned above, Mr. Phillips proceeded with an action on behalf of Pearce-Ell in relation to the very agreements his law firm prepared following an all party meeting in July 2011 at his office.
Moreover, the conditional nature of the transaction, which was crucial to the defendants and which appears to have been impressed upon Ms. Phillips at that meeting, features prominently in the pleadings.
am unable to see how clearly expressed Rule should be excused by pointing the equitable finger of delay at the Holgates.
Mr. Phillips appears to confuse the ethical obligations imposed upon lawyers with evidentiary rules.

There is no evidence before this Court of an informed waiver.
DECISION [55] For the aforementioned reasons, the application is granted.","HELD: The Court granted the application.
It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants.
That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.","[217, 218, 212, 216, 2, 7, 206, 205, 19, 8, 20, 209]"

Subject: Summary Judgment, CPR 13.04 (2009) Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 298, s. 2(ak) and s. 62(1) Interpretation Vicarious Liability Requirements
The Chambers judge committed no error in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success.
This information sheet does not form part of the court’s judgment.
The full court judgment consists of 17 pages.
[65] In short, the policy considerations set out in Bazley, supra, do not exist for imposing vicarious liability on Chrysler.
Judges: MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; Saunders and Farrar, JJ.A.
Appeal Heard: October 6, 2010, in Halifax, Nova Scotia
Held: Appeals dismissed per reasons for judgment of Farrar, J.A.; MacDonald, C.J.N.S. and Saunders, J.A. concurring.

[69] In paragraph [53], sub-paragraph 3., second line, substitute the word “contact” with the word “conduct”.","The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff.
The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle.
The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence.
The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee.
Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","[1, 21, 292, 290, 20, 0, 291, 289, 295, 4, 16, 23, 293, 2, 294, 5, 13, 297, 17, 266]"
508,"1. THAT HE, the said Trevor Wade Meyers on or about the 4th day of February, A.D. 2011 at or near Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan, did knowingly utter a threat to F.M. to cause death to F.M., contrary to Section 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
6. THAT HE, the said Trevor Wade Meyers on or about the 26th day of February, A.D. 2011 at or near Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan, did knowingly utter a threat to F.M. to cause death to F.M., contrary to Section 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
[2] This matter proceeded to trial.
[3] The complainant, F.M., testified.
She testified to her criminal record, which is dated.
They trekked back to the hotel, with the complainant falling at least once.
She said he had advised her via telephone that charges were pending against the defendant but he had not been arrested as he was back in Rocanville.
[48] On cross-examination, it was established that the complainant’s testimony about these threats (“I’ll fucking kill you”) was consistent with prior statements and testimony.
[50] The defendant denied contacting or threatening the complainant on either occasion.
Further, his testimony does not even raise doubt as to these occurrences.
Again, have to say that after careful weighing and assessment of all the evidence, have no doubt of his guilt of these five charges.","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped.
An argument ensued about missing shopping bag.
The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant.
At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges.
HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault.
2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement.
3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code.
The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive.
4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel.
5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant.
The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","[11, 7, 6, 1, 243, 14, 238, 245, 248, 24, 233]"

BACKGROUND The information developed by Correctional Services and placed before the sentencing judge, in the form of pre-sentence report, discloses that:
Mr. Riley was born on November 24th,1976, and was raised primarily by his paternal grandparents.
During his late childhood, he lived with his father for 3-4 years but eventually returned to his grandparents where he remained until he was 17.
He was prescribed medication but refused to take it;
It was made clear to counsel for the appellant that the March 18 letter, filed at the hearing, provided inadequate information.
An appellate court should not be given free rein to modify sentencing order simply because it feels that different order ought to have been made.
cannot say, taking into account the circumstances of the offence and this offender, that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was clearly unreasonable.
1995 Case No. 558566
IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
versus KEVIN DALE RILEY
DATE HEARD: December 4, 1995
NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
BETWEEN: Kevin Riley
and Her Majesty the Queen
Respondent REASONS FOR
JUDGMENT BY:","The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car.
Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing.
The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail.
The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol.
Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms,
that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment.
Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value.
It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made.
Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","[181, 180, 177, 173, 160, 9, 164, 10, 17, 167, 170, 6, 168, 8, 178, 179, 169, 156]"

[3] The complainant, Bear, drove her truck, to the party and on arrival at the house party the accused asked Bear for her keys to the vehicle because he did not want her to drive because she had been drinking.
Both parties were pushing each other and the complainant states she was trying to defend herself from the blows of the accused.
[36] Section 249(1) of the Criminal Code provides:
249(1) Every one commits an offence who operates
[38] It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.
[39] Given the evidence which I accept, the accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown has proven each and every ingredient of this offence to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and I find the accused guilty of this charge.
[40] accept the evidence of Darnell and that of Conlee with respect to Counts No. and of the indictment.
On the evidence, the Crown has proven the guilt of the accused to my satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt on both Counts No. 4 and 5 and therefore I find the accused guilty as charged on those counts.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code.
HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict.
2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant.
The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result,
the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter.
It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered.
The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public.
The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.
The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty.
4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","[103, 5, 105, 99, 14, 94, 102, 95, 8]"

the above order to withdraw from Saskatoon, it may do so.","The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.
The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance.
As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes.
Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.
An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act.
They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent.
HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court.

In the alternative Clarke pleads contributory negligence and in any event puts CN to strict proof of the damages allegedly suffered.

ii. Who was involved in the loading and what recollections they have.
Further, find this to be the quickest means of dealing with the questions asked at the least expense.
That remained its position on this application.

The balance of CN’s application is dismissed.
[51] have for the most part dismissed the application by CN for relief.
While have ordered proper responses be provided in respect of undertakings 34 and 35, this was minor part of the relief sought and was matter that normally would have been dealt with on an informal basis between counsel or by follow-up examination.
Significant briefs of fact and law were filed.","HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable.
The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue.
This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules.
The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses.
With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled.
Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits.
The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it.
It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so.
The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied.
The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege.
Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature.
The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one.
Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with.
The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","[161, 11, 9, 155, 156, 151, 158, 157, 148, 14, 12, 145]"

April 13, 2006
[1] Michael Therrien brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for Nadine Therrien.
[3] There is dispute on the facts concerning what was discussed at the initial meeting of the parties with their lawyers.
The Parties’ Views
[4] Ms. Ponder (formerly Therrien) deposes to the following:
2. retained my current lawyer, Reg Sauer, of Richmond Nychuk law firm in October, 2003 when decided would be moving to Texas....
Attached as Exhibit “B” is true copy of the December 11, 2003 correspondence sent by my lawyer to Mr. Nidesh.

3. That have looked through my client file.
4. have reviewed the Minutes of the Collaborative Law meeting held January 9th, 2004.
It is possible that two different contracts were discussed but have no recollection of whether it was or not.
do not have any recollection of whether this was discussed with either of the parties or Reginald Sauer.
DISCUSSION [10] The conflict in the facts was apparent at the time of the initial application.","FIAT: The respondent brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for the petitioner.
The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared.
The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties.

This Bylaw shall cover Executive officers of Local 59 only.
3) The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause.
39) The Union submits that there are two key reasons why the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified under the indemnity by-law:
41) The Union asks that if the Court concludes, as have done, that it has jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment under Queen’s Bench Rule 485, that it consider dismissing the plaintiff’s claim.
43) The pith and substance of the Fourth Action is to compel the Union to provide the plaintiff with war chest for the sole purpose of suing the Union and its officers.
Since that time, commentators and pundits of every stripe have embraced the phrase “the law is an ass”.
Notwithstanding the best efforts of legislators and judges, expect, from time to time, the law is still an ass.","The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union.
He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws.
The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause.
HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed.
The within action is dismissed in full.
1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws.
This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board.
The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment.
2) The plaintiff represents himself.
He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000.
The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions.
3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed.
The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","[162, 161, 4, 7, 145, 157, 6, 151]"

There is no need to decide on the argument there was breach of the duty of fairness because of breaches of the regulations.","The applicants applied for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the school board to close two schools.
The applicants were parents of children who attended one of the two closed schools.,
application allowed in part; certiorari granted in respect of the decision to close the school which the applicants' children attended; the applicants had no standing to challenge the closure of the second school as they were not directly affected by its closure.
The School Board breached its general duty to act fairly in allowing a Board member to vote when he had not attended the public meetings on the issue.
The Board did not meet the onus on it to show that the member had appropriate firsthand knowledge of the evidence and submission of the applicants.","[349, 339, 13, 10, 4, 351, 345, 15, 9, 350]"
519,"Liability has been admitted by the defendant and special damages have been resolved between the parties.
Mr. Hiltz, age 33, is married with three children, ages 7, and 2.
He has Grade 10 education plus two years vocational school training and has been working for 15 years.
At the time of the accident, he worked as technician which involved body work including heavy frame work, panel replacement and painting.
He was in line of cars and noted some difficulty further ahead.
The rear‑end collision resulted in his exhaust being knocked off, the splash pan rolled under, the bumper cracked and subsequently, leak was found in the gas tank.
He then drove home without any problems.
Upon arriving home, he had shower and went to sit on the couch.
In my opinion, Mr. Hiltz is left with myofascial or chronic pain, mainly relating to his left hip.
He does not have pain all day every day, but he exercises care in what he is doing because he fears he will cause himself more pain.
There will be no reduction in the number of years for the award of interest.
To award full interest would amount to double recovery which should be avoided.
TRIAL DIVISION
BETWEEN: Jerome Hiltz","The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries suffered as a result of his car being hit from behind.
He had continued pain in the neck, shoulder, back and hip four and one half years after the accident.

The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer.

521,"[1] The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2 (the “Act”) which:(a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors, MacPherson, Leslie & Tyerman (“MLT”), in relation to the respondent’s claim in Queen’s Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina (the “Action”), pending the petitioner’s application or further court order; (b) restrains MLT from releasing or paying to the respondent any monies that they have received or may receive in relation to the Action;(c) restrains MLT from releasing or paying to any Chris Anderson or Christopher Anderson, any monies that they have received or may receive in relation to a claim by a Chris Anderson or Christopher Anderson against the Attorney General of Canada; and(d) restrains the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation to the Action or any claim against the Attorney General of Canada pending the petitioner’s application or further court order.
Both parties agree that the provision in the ex parte order referred to in (c) above is not required and should terminate.
[13] The Court is not satisfied that the restraining order should extend to any one other than the respondent.
The ex parte restraining order against MLT shall therefore be lifted.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action.
The respondent applies to have the order set aside.
The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders.
He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction.
The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act.
HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act.
Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security.
For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him.
The parties may apply to vary this amount in future.
Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance.
The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act.
If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act.
As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations.
Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act.
The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim.
When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","[68, 3, 70, 0]"

On Appeal From: 4520/86 J.C. Regina
Reasons: March 13, 1995
Appeal File: No. 1929
Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
CAMERON J.A.
It will not be necessary to hear from you Mr. Morris.
Having regard for the standard of review applicable to this appeal, we can find no tenable basis for interfering with the order made in the Court of Queen's Bench.
In other words, Mr. Garden, we have not been persuaded that Mr. Justice Kyle either erred in principle in the exercise of the discretionary powers of the Court to dismiss for want of prosecution where there has been inordinate and inexcusable giving rise to prejudice, or overlooked or disregarded a material consideration, or acted unjudicially.
That being so, there is nothing vitiating the exercise by the chamber judge of discretion and no basis for interference by us.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent, such costs to be taxed in the usual way.","The Defendant applied to strike out the Plaintiff's action for want of prosecution.
The application was successful.
The Plaintiff appealed.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
The Court was not persuaded that the Chambers Judge had either erred in principle in the exercise of the discretionary powers of the Court to dismiss for want of prosecution where there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay giving rise to prejudice, or overlooked or disregarded a material consideration, or acted unjudicially.","[0, 11, 6, 7, 1, 5, 8, 10, 4, 2, 3, 9]"
523,"[1] This is high-conflict family law matter.
The parties have come to this court to determine what should happen on an interim basis.
[2] The parties married October 11, 2008, and separated in April 2011.
Two sons were born of their marriage: Adam, on March 31, 2007 and Quinn, on August 3, 2009.
[3] There is little utility in reviewing the events within the marriage in exhaustive detail.
Within months of the marriage the father was charged criminally and served time in jail.
When this action was commenced in spring 2011, the mother had to obtain an ex parte order returning the boys to her care.
[37] am therefore prepared to order that the children have telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until the father is released from custody.
If the further types of communication mentioned above are possible, the telephone access shall be converted accordingly.
[38] hasten to note that the mother has legal duty to promote and foster this access.
Her willingness (or lack of same) to ensure connection between the children and their father may well be significant factor in her remaining the primary parent.
[39] Accordingly, make the following order:
If the further types of communication mentioned above are possible, the telephone access shall be converted accordingly.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant.
She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse.
The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year.
The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail.
The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order.
One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner.
HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis.
The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances.
The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour.
The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release.
This is not a realistic option.
It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial.
With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.
The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","[1, 6, 157, 164, 5, 161, 8, 160, 155, 156, 11, 9, 12]"
524,"[1] Susan and Stephen Mabey were divorced in 1996 after 20 year marriage.
The oldest, Melissa, attended Boston College from 1995 to 1999.
significant source of funding for Melissa’s education came from american “Federal Plus” loans.
Ms. Mabey claims an agreement with Mr. Mabey that he would be responsible for these outstanding obligations.
[2] In anticipation of collection proceedings, Ms. Mabey brought Divorce Act application against Mr. Mabey.
[3] Ms. Mabey’s Divorce Act application seeks relief in several forms.
[32] In Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc. 1990 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1990]
(b) It is false, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;
I would not describe the application as scandalous or vexatious, but in light of my earlier findings, it can be described as frivolous.
[36] The pleadings and submissions of Ms. Mabey indicate she is not concerned about the form of relief, whether it be child support order, spousal support order or judgment.
Mr. Mabey did not take the deduction as contemplated in their agreement and there is no evidence Ms. Mabey declared it as income.
[38] In conclusion I am satisfied that Mr. Mabey’s application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 succeeds.
In the event the parties cannot agree on quantum, will accept submissions.","The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract.
In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American).
The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation.
Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'.
There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","[165, 169, 166, 152, 161, 2, 145, 7, 158, 0, 13, 6, 3]"
525,"[1] Steven Szwagierczak was widower when he died on April 10, 2014.
His wife, Betty, passed away on the morning of September 23, 2013.
Later that same day, Mr. Szwagierczak met with lawyer and purportedly instructed her to prepare his Last Will and Testament.
[3] For the reasons that follow in this fiat, am satisfied that the applicant has not made out genuine issue for trial to prove the will in solemn form.
Firstly, the evidence provides some vague and nonspecific descriptions of her father’s demeanour and utterances during an extremely troubling and painful time in his life.
[54] In my view, the evidence Debra presents of her father’s behaviour at the relevant time does not raise genuine issue for trial on any of the indicia listed by Schwann J.
[57] Further, if there was real issue regarding the haste in which the will was prepared and signed, one would have expected the challenge to be based on an allegation of undue influence.
Considering that such an allegation would require evidence of Mr. Szwagierczak’s free will having been overborne by the actions of others, think the applicant was wise not to have asserted it.
Upon the expiry of the appeal period from this decision, the caveat shall be vacated and letters probate may issue as prayed.","Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity
After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property.
The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012.
His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will.
It was based on his first will with some revisions.
The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter.
The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters.
The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused.
When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything.
The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him.
The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will.
The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable.
The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions.
When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests.
The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.
The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","[0, 1, 223, 2, 221, 7, 212, 214, 226]"
526,"He did not have the benefit of preliminary inquiry as result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him.
There is no evidence before the court on the merits of the case as the trial has yet to begin.
It is also argued that the security measures presently in place and focussed on by the media have instilled in the general populous climate of fear which makes the selection of an impartial jury impossible.
In rare cases, sufficient proof that these safeguards are not likely to prevent juror bias may warrant some form of relief being granted under s.24(1) of the Charter.""
In my opinion the Applicant in the present case has not established on balance of probabilities that his right to fair trial by an impartial jury has been violated.
What the applicant has established is that challenges for cause are desirable and I will permit counsel to challenge prospective jurors for cause should counsel so wish providing that a list of proposed questions is presented to the Court for it perusal by 930 a.m. Thursday October 1 st, 1998.
It may be that such an exercise will lead to the discovery that noimpartial jurors can be found, but until this exercise is attempted we are left with mere speculation as to the effect of the pre-trial publicity.","The accused was charged with first degree murder.
Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity.

The remaining debts were to financial institutions.
VAC Pension $1,509.39
CPP Pension 1,466.36
Child Support 1,814.00
Child Tax Benefit 937.79
This leaves surplus of $651.50.
Ms. Smith has not made any payments for surplus income.
However, if there have been in the meantime changes in her income which would justify her paying lesser amount, will hear the parties before the discharge order is granted and consider making an adjustment.
[61] The Trustee asks for s.68 order.
[62] My authority for granting discharges is section 172 of the BIA.
However, cannot rely on the latter subsection without there being proof of fact under section 173.
Although have some reservations about the manner in which Ms. Smith has been treated in the administration of her estate, there nevertheless are duties which technically she has failed to perform, for example providing information for completion of income tax returns.

September 1, 2009","The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds.
The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service.
The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee.
The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension.
The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","[265, 261, 266, 259, 16, 18, 8, 3, 12, 0, 4, 15, 256, 262, 5, 245, 237, 236, 240, 247, 238, 255]"

[2] Four grounds of appeal are set out:
(a) the decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented.
[5] Mr. Pottie did not set up or use trust account, but rather deposited the security deposit and the monthly rental cheques in his personal account.
[6] Ms. Howell did not receive rent or copy of the lease and was having difficulty getting Mr. Pottie to answer her inquiries.
On the advise of lawyer, Ms. Howell instructed Mr. Cormier to complain to the police, the Commission, and Mr. Pottie's broker.
6. The role of the offender in acknowledging what had occurred
Again, the decision in Jaswal, supra, beginning at paragraph 40, and in Creager at paragraphs 96 and 97, are relevant.
[69] This court makes no comment on the appropriateness of the sanctions that were imposed.
Obviously, however, primary concern should be the protection of the public and thereby the integrity of the real estate profession.
[70] The court will hear the parties with respect to costs if requested.","A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee.
He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses.
When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent.
He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission.
At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible.
The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000.
The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed.
Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.
It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","[2, 205, 209, 208, 201, 1, 9, 15, 10, 189, 0]"
530,"[1] This matter involves an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an Order in the nature of Mandamus compelling the Respondent, Department of Community Services to comply with an Order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board, dated September 17th, 2007.
Carl Smith, the Applicant, is disabled and has been long term recipient of income assistance benefits from the Department of Community Services.
[2] Mr. Smith’s income assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information.
His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information.
He appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal Board on September 6, 2007.
The Board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed which was June 27, 2007.
[3] Rather than comply with the Board’s decision, the Department of Community Services in October 2007, requested further financial information from Mr. Smith.
As to timing, the Act was required to be done when the Appeal Board released its decision, retroactive to June 2007.
[19] Accordingly, the Court will grant the application for an Order in the nature of Mandamus compelling the Respondent to implement the Appeal Board’s decision of September 2007.","The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board.
The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information.
He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated.
The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information.
Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated.
He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement.
Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board.
The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected.
It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision.
To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless.
As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","[73, 71, 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 2, 8]"
531,"[1] The applicant mother seeks a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father’s appeal from that decision.
The trial judge’s conclusions in that respect were as follows:
[41] It is not possible to conclude that Mackenzie can be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way.
From the time that Mackenzie was toddler until he was 10 or 11 years old, both of his parents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia.
Nevertheless, conclude that the maintenance of the child’s relationship with his sister is the foremost consideration before the court in determination of what is in the child’s best interests.
The father’s seeming inability to facilitate the child’s access to his mother, and therefore to his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern.
Additionally, note that the school year will commence shortly and, in that respect, the lifting of the stay would allow the child to settle into routine and schedule during the school year, pending the hearing of the appeal.
[7] Accordingly, find it to be in the best interests of the child to lift the stay of execution imposed on the judgment under Rule 15(1).","The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212).
The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent.
As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.
HELD: The Court granted the application.
There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted.
The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","[87, 9, 82, 10, 80, 83, 5, 2]"
532,"The transcript of the proceedings is the official record.
That on or about the 12th day of January, 2007 at or near Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan, they did steal cash and miscellaneous items, the property of Southland Corporation (Devonshire Seven Eleven), and at the time thereof did use violence against Larry Bryska, contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code;
It would be useful, however, to summarize those findings in order to put the offences in their proper perspective for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence for each.
[41] The Crown has advised that no order for DNA sample is required in respect of Mr. [J.L.P.] as there has been previous order.
However, do make an order in form 5.04 pursuant to s. 487.052(1) authorizing the taking from Mr. [T.T.A.], for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose by means of the investigative procedures described in s. 487.06(1) as am satisfied it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so.
[43] The victim surcharge will be waived in respect of each Mr. [J.L.P.] and Mr. [T.T.A.] in consideration of the fact that they have already been in custody for ten months.","The two accused were found guilty, after trial, of robbery with violence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and wearing a mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s. 351(2) of the Code.
HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked.
Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months.
The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","[7, 189, 1, 4, 184, 185]"
533,"The first floor was below ground level and was accessed by entering the building and walking downstairs.
Self closing doors were located at both ends of the common hallway leading to stairs and stairwells used for entering and exiting the building.
The stairwell located on the south side of the building led to the front door.
The north stairwell led to the back door of the building.
The plaintiff, Ms. Leslie’s apartment was located on the top floor at the north-east corner adjacent to the north stairwell.
She was the tenant and resided in the apartment with her two young children and occasionally with her partner at the time, the plaintiff Harry Bryson.
fire alarm pull-station was also located on the wall next to the bell system.
Each stairwell also had smoke detector located on the ceiling above the stairwell.
These were also wired into the fire alarm panel.
Ms. Leslie’s older son was staying overnight at his grandmother’s home.
Although she stated she experienced back pain from sitting on the job, (which resolved) her main reason for leaving related to problems with one of her special needs children.
As well she has history of hearing problems.
Dr. Ellis, Ms. Leslie’s family physician, placed her on permanent disability.","The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building.
The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility.
The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula.
He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports.
Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion.
The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib.
She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip.
She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp.
The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.
The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions.
Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income.
Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.
Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue.
When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs.
Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.
The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","[8, 7, 9, 10, 16, 4, 14, 6, 22, 721, 716, 710, 17]"
534,"Oral Decision:
Subject: Motion for Interim Injunction CPR 41.04
Facts: 30 year employee of Plaintiff Company resigns to open competing business.
Had signed non compete agreement in 1995.
Issue: Whether interim injunction should issue in advance of motion for interlocutory injunction.
Factors in CPR 41.04 satisfied.
In particular, an urgency existed in the sense that the Defendant had resigned only weeks earlier and the opening of the new business was imminent.
Considering all the circumstances, it was just to issue the interim injunction.
Plaintiff’s motion was not frivolous or vexatious.
The balance of convenience favored the Plaintiff.
[12] Ultimately come to Rule 41.04 2(d): considering all of the circumstances is it just to issue an order for an Interim Injunction.
[14] At this stage, am satisfied that have only to consider whether there is serious issue to be tried.
[16] Again, I do not think that we get into the realm of speculation when one considers a small community like Berwick.
That would be the case even if unrelated third parties were opening the new business.
The balance of convenience, obviously favours the status quo.
[18] The Interim Injunction will issue.
The Interlocutory Injunction motion will be heard in Halifax before Justice LeBlanc on April 24, 2012.","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community.
The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions.
He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995.
He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April.
Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store.
The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction.
Interim injunction granted.
The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions.
This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted.
Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait.
While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried.
There is.
This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application.
There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community.
An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks.
The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April.

535,"[1] There are several issues to be determined on this application.
Payment of $55,000 to BPG
[2] The applicant asserts that the respondent's father's company (the third party) paid $55,000 to BPG, the respondent's company, in contravention of the order of the court made June 7, 1999 directing any funds accruing to BPG to be paid into court, and freezing any money to be paid out.
That cheque was deposited to the bank account of BPG on June 8, 1999, and applied by the bank against the overdraft.
The applicant asserts that the third party was served (on May 28, 1999) with notice of the application giving rise to the judgment of June 7, 1999.
[4] The issue should be resolved at trial where evidence can be weighed and findings of credibility can be made.
[8] The interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home to the applicant shall not be changed.
She is at liberty to rent the home and receive the income therefrom provided that she maintains the home and ensures payment of all costs.
The respondent has other suitable accommodation.
[9] The applicant is directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the fifth-wheel recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sales proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien indebtedness (approximately $25,000) and to pay the balance into court.
[10] Costs are reserved to trial.","The applicant asserted the third party (the respondent's father's company) paid $55,000 to the respondent's company in contravention of the June 7, 1999 order which directed any funds accruing to the company be paid into court and froze any money to be paid out.
The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial.
The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access.
The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January.
2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.
Their primary residence was to continue to be with her.
She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency.
Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders.
Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence.
3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed.
The applicant was at liberty to rent the home.
4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court.

537,"Location: Regina
Between: Her Majesty the Queen
and Gary W. Rookes
JUDGMENT M. HINDS,
BACKGROUND [1] On February 26, 2010 at Regina, Saskatchewan, Gary Rookes was charged with the following offences:
(3) Operate motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so, contrary to section 259(4) of the Criminal Code.
[2] The matter proceeded to trial.
The issue before the court is whether the GiO cycle which Mr. Rookes was operating is a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code.
[24] In this case the Crown must prove that Mr. Rookes GiO bike was motor vehicle, as defined by section of the Criminal Code.
[28] Applying step one of the test do not believe all of the evidence of the accused, hence am not obligated to acquit him.
At times during Mr. Rookes’ testimony was left with the impression that his testimony sounded somewhat rehearsed particularly respecting his consumption of alcohol earlier that day.
troubling aspect of his evidence concerns the lack any detailed observations respecting Mr. Rookes’ GiO bike.
[31] As result am of the view that the Crown has failed to prove that Mr. Rookes was operating motor vehicle on the evening of February 26, 2010.
CONCLUSION [32] I find Gary Rookes to be not guilty of the charges before the court.","The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code.
The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence.
At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code.
The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it.
HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court.
There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.","[136, 134, 5, 9, 128, 2, 120, 1, 121, 6, 0, 10, 109, 14]"

[2] After a show cause hearing on November 24, 2004 her Honour Judge Carol A. Snell refused to release Mr. [T.C.M.] from detention.
Her conclusion in that respect cannot be seriously questioned.
[5] Although only 21 years of age, Mr. [D.G.W.] was convicted, in youth courts in Manitoba, between August, 1998 and February, 2002, of 13 breaking and entering, and theft, and possession of stolen property charges; one charge of assault; three charges of failing to comply with undertakings; and one charge of being unlawfully at large.

5) Not leave his place of residence between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the following day, and shall present himself personally to any peace officer checking such curfew.
6) Abstain from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs, and shall not enter any public premise which serves alcoholic beverages.
10) Have no contact with the other alleged co-conspirators except for the purpose of preparation for trial.","The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004.
After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention.
The accused apply for a review of the detention orders.
HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed.
The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned.
2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set.
No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005.
The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.
 It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest.
3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","[55, 51, 2, 6, 44, 13, 50, 1, 7]"

Anne-Marie MacDougall for the respondent
[1] This is an application for an order to declare that the Land Use By-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public at 192 Highway #2, Enfield, Nova Scotia.
The applicant has operated the billiard club since June, 1997 and has had ""special premises liquor license"" granted by the Alcohol and Gaming Authority of the Province of Nova Scotia.
That license has allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following:
5. No advertising of the availability of liquor service shall be permitted.
6. Access to the club shall only be obtained by way of card/key system.
10. No entertainment permit shall be issued in respect of this license.
6. The amendment of the category of liquor license will not have the effect of liberating the applicant from the constraints of activities now carried out.
""That change, within reasonable limits should be accommodated"".
The court should attempt to ground its decision on objective facts.
[33] In my view, the change of liquor license sought by the applicant will not constitute a change of use from that presently enjoyed by the applicant.","The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food.
The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation.
The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement.
The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use.
Application granted;
the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.
There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","[9, 10, 13, 7, 6, 2, 237, 1, 231, 235, 0, 233]"

Written Judgment: December 3, 2002
Held: Appeal allowed per oral reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.;
Reasons for judgment:
[1] This is an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by MacDougall, J. of an order requiring the receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended.
[2] The single issue is whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were “subject to [an] agreement for sale at arms’ length” at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession.
He found that ITI had selected the books in issue here and that, therefore, the books delivered to ITI were subject to an agreement for sale to the students.
[6] Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and an order will issue directing return of the goods or payment of their value.
Counsel for the appellant will prepare the order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court.","A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution.
Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books.
The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt. 
A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed.
Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered.
Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time.
The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand.
The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials.
Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","[3, 0, 8, 4, 20, 21, 10, 9, 15]"

Accordingly, while there is obviously some lack of attribution of direct quotations to the defendant Banga, again am satisfied that the plaintiffs have pled the matter in way which is not offensive to the general principles of pleading.
[48] While I have considered the very able comments of Mr. Caroline on behalf of the plaintiffs, I am simply struck by the fact that para. 68 is both irrelevant and immaterial.
[50] am of the view that no costs should be ordered at this time, but rather direct that the costs in this matter as between the applicants and the respondents (not including the defendant Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.) are to be costs in the cause.","Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9
The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp.
The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial.
The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants.
Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment.
The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose.
The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation.
The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media.
HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition.
Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time.
It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","[299, 15, 296, 7, 283, 1, 4, 303, 12]"
545,"V.H. MEEKMA, PCJ JUDGMENT
[1] The accused was charged with the following four counts:
Count #1 on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did being at large on her undertaking given to Justice or Judge, and being bound to comply with condition thereof, to wit: Keep the peace and be of good behaviour, fail without lawful excuse to comply with that condition, contrary to Section 145(3) of the Criminal Code.
Count #4 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in her blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 253(b) and Section 255(1) of the Criminal Code.
[31] This is the more difficult issue, due to the accused’s own testimony that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the motor vehicle.
[34] The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would “kick in” and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station.","The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code.
HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.
 1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it.
Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand.
There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith.
The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached.
2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand.
The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system.
When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving.
The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand.
The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
 3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle.
She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station.
She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired.
The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving.
There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","[1, 0, 5, 88, 90, 2]"

JUDGMENT B. MORGAN,
Sitting next to Mr. Kenny in the front seat of the truck was his nephew Tyrone Hryniuk.
In the back seat of the four door extended cab truck was Mr. Kenny’s son Morgan Kenny.
[18] The terms “searchlight”, “hunting”, and “wildlife”, are all defined in the Act or the Regulations.
Exhibit P-3, the million candle power searchlight, clearly casts “a beam of light” amply demonstrated by the Agreed Statement of Facts and the observations of both the SERM personnel in the surveillance aircraft and the SERM employees that pulled Mr. Kenny over.
[19] “Hunting” in the Act includes the act of “searching for” wildlife, “wildlife” being defined as vertebrate animal of any species that is wild by nature in Saskatchewan; wildlife would include the very animals the cassette tape was designed to attract.
[20] On all the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kenny was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife,
and I find him guilty.
[23] Section 76 speaks to prohibition period during which convicted individual cannot apply for or obtain any big game licence, game bird licence, or fur licence, and section 74 of the Act speaks to the monetary penalty for contraventions of the Act or Regulations.","Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting.
Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2)
For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife.
The case was decided on the basis of credibility.
The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused.
The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife.
HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","[5, 2, 91, 97, 92, 88, 87, 89, 19, 20]"
547,"I. Introduction
[1] The proposed appellants, McMillan LLP and Michael Friedman (collectively “McMillan”) are two of the defendants in the within action commenced by the proposed respondent, Melvin Schneider (“the representative plaintiff”).
McMillan responded by seeking an order pursuant to Rule 173(c) of The Queen's Bench Rules striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit.
They also opposed the certification of the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client.
[2] The learned Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(c) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants.
These facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the evidence of Mr. Davies, establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of The Class Actions Act.
In my view, the Chambers judge made no error in his interpretation of the applicable law or the evidence before him, or in his application of the law to the relevant facts before him, which would warrant leave being granted based on arguments advanced by McMillan.","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan.
The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan.
McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website.
The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency.
The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence.
McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client.
Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors.
The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.
The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act.
HELD: The Court dismissed the applications.
It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious.
The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case.
McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client.
The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class.
McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.
These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","[8, 69, 73, 3, 5, 2, 6]"

The material satisfies me that the applicants are responsible individuals who have genuine affection and concern for the child.
This fact, in my view, warrants consideration by the court in assessing what is in the best interests of the child in terms of access to that child.
They are, in my view, separate relationships with unique characteristics to each of them.

The accused has never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it.
[20] note also that the gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence, another factor which must bear in mind in light of the suggestion that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.
To exclude the evidence in question would, in fact, bring the administration of justice into manifest disrepute.","The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics.

HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied.

Since the separation, Ryan has continued to live with his mother.
[2] In October of 2007, Ms. Jeffrey made an application under the Maintenance and Custody Act.
As a result, the only remaining issue was, as acknowledged in the Consent Order, the retroactivity of child maintenance (table and section 7 expenses) for the period from August, 2001, to and including December, 2007.
In September of 2001, the amount of such payment was $300.00 per month.
In November of 2006, the amount was increased to $400.00 and continued as such until January of 2008.
24. With respect to paragraph 57 of the Applicant’s affidavit, Ms. Jeffrey did not ask me what was earning, nor did ask her.
[41] Mr. Jeffrey questions if some of these submitted expenses would fit the definition of section of the Guidelines, as amended.
He questions if the court has been provided with sufficient evidence to conclude that these expenses occurred.

Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009.
The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years.
The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines.
She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it.
The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands.
Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward.
The father's hardship arguments rejected.
He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income.
The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient.
Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied.
The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses.
During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","[2, 6, 9, 13, 0, 15, 189, 3, 188, 5, 198, 197, 185]"

C‑46, and operating motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
[2] The investigation into the events which the charges were based on included demand from police officer that Mr. Plantje provide roadside sample of his breath into an approved screening device (""ASD"").

A new trial on the s. 253(1)(b) charge is ordered pursuant to s.686(4)(b)(i) of the Criminal Code.","The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard.
The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met.
The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on.
The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning.
The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission.
A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time.
It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent.
The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body.
An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol.
Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.","[257, 259, 3, 254, 2, 1, 10, 239, 11]"

JUDGMENT MEGAW J.
Introduction
[1] The accused has applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of search of the accused’s computer and cellular phone.
[57] As indicated, there is difference between that found on the computer in the pictures or recycle bin and those found in the temporary internet files.
The warrant authorized obtaining the search history from this computer.
They could have obtained further warrant.
[60] While the nature of the offence would suggest society demands complete adjudication on the merits, the nature of the search here suggests otherwise.
After the fact justification is not something the court will support in these circumstances.
[61] The police were looking for internet history.
CONCLUSION [62] As a result of all of the foregoing, I determine the materials found through the temporary internet files are not excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
That is the items in the first row and the last three rows; 3. Exhibit P6, Tab 3 is admissible; 4. Exhibit P6, Tab 4 relating to Temporary Internet files is admissible; and 5. Exhibit P8 with the exception of the indicated excluded pages.","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible.
The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer.
The police had no authority to search the computer generally.
They were only authorized to look at the Internet history.
The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.
The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","[315, 2, 310, 3, 300, 318, 9, 8, 7, 304, 307, 11, 311, 12, 296]"
554,"Counsel: Shane Parker, Crown Attorney
By the Court:
[1] The accused, Steven Lee Pinch, had previously entered guilty pleas to five counts contained in an indictment.
That was accepted by the Crown and the Court.
[3] The second count is number three in the indictment, that the accused:on or about the 12th day October, A.D. 2004 at or near Aldersville in the County of Lunenburg, Province of Nova Scotia, did break and enter the dwelling house of James Eustace and did commit therein an indictable offence contrary to Section 348(1)(d) of the Criminal Code.
[7] The facts have been outlined in considerable detail by counsel for the Crown, Mr. Parker and Mr. Stewart, counsel for the accused, acknowledges that he is substantially in agreement with the facts as stated by crown counsel.
[32] As I have indicated, I have concluded ,therefore, that the appropriate sentence in this case, having regard to all of the factors that I have mentioned, is that the accused serve a term of four years and six months in a federal institution.
That sentence, without giving the credits as have for the time already served, would be very close to the sentence proposed by Mr. Parker for the Crown.
At the same time have taken into account the factors emphasized by Mr. Stewart.","The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed.
He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused.
He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods.
Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment;
in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","[3, 0, 2, 7, 8, 136, 135, 134, 13]"

In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron
SHERSTOBITOFF J.A. (orally)
[1] This appeal against sentence must be allowed.
The offence is breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.
The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia.
In these circumstances, while we agree that a period of probation is an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of the term which prohibits him from consuming alcohol is inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance, and does not have, as far as we can see, any other purpose.
Furthermore, the term of the period of probation, three years, is out of all proportion to the nature of the offence.
[2] The sentence is varied by reducing the term of probation to one year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing.","An appeal of a sentence for a breach of recognizance made under s.810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.
HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing.
A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.
The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","[0, 10, 9, 4, 5, 8, 1, 3, 7]"

The sole issue now before this Court is the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses.
2) The parties were married on August 19, 1972 and separated August 1, 1994.
On September 8, 1998 the parties were granted judgment for divorce which included child support.
These orders largely deal with the status of the children and the costs associated with their post-secondary education.
3) On December 3, 2002, Justice Dickson terminated Mr. Alm’s obligation to pay support for the parties’ oldest child, Corry and ordered, in addition to ongoing support for the two youngest children, payment of s. expenses relating to Kristin’s attendance at university.
The consent order fixed Mr. Alm’s s. obligations for both Kristin and Brina at $609 per month commencing August 1, 2004.

8) It is noted that the September 28, 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina’s s. 7 expenses.
Accordingly, that expense shall be disallowed.

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education.
It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training.
HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly.
2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses.
Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs.
2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans.

By the Court:
[1] The defendant has made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S.
[3] The grounds stated in the Information to Obtain were:
The source advised if person purchased gram of marihuana and mushrooms, the cost was $22.00 total.
The informant also stated he/she had purchased marihuana from Mr. Rhodenizer in the past and that Mr. Rhodenizer purchases his narcotics from the city.
There was therefore evidence on which the Justice of the Peace could conclude that this was continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the warrant application.
To suggest that the traffic could have been going to the other basement apartment is to propose level of coincidence that is highly improbable in the light of the information provided by the four sources.
Conclusion [12] I find that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of this warrant.
[13] Having found that the warrant was properly issued and that the search therefore met the standard in Charter s. 8, need not consider s. 24(2).","The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid.
Application dismissed;
there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant.
Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","[91, 89, 3, 7, 85, 2, 0, 88, 10, 11]"

The issue in this case is whether police officer may overturn the decision made against her by the Police Review Board for the reason that the Regulation number by which she was charged did not precisely correspond to the Regulation number for which she was found guilty.
Constable Maureen White (""White"" or ""the applicant"") argues that the Nova Scotia Police Review Board erred in finding her guilty of disciplinary default for which she had not been charged.
Constable White was given notice of the allegation against her by Form 11, pursuant to Reg. 16(8), on March 20, 1990.
find the Board was free to substitute what it felt to be the ""proper"" section number and conclude, in the circumstances, that Constable White was guilty of the disciplinary default referred to in 5(1)(d).
It is obvious from review of all of the forms which were completed, including Form 12, that the allegations made against White included the allegation that she had lied to the complainants during the course of the investigation.
The failure to refer to what the Police Review Board considered the ""proper"" offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only, and in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of these proceedings.
Respondents
DECISION OF SAUNDERS, J.","A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault.
The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous.
A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying.
She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate.
The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited.
Dismissing the application,
that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction.
The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing.
Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention.

 1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type.

This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user.
The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn.
2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor.

An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act.
The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability.
The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher.
HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act.
2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver.
The reasoning in Neault was directly on point.
Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes.
When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act.
The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers.
The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute.
4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer.
The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","[203, 205, 202, 201, 3, 207, 206, 8, 6, 7, 4, 210, 192, 13, 195, 200, 24, 1, 208, 189]"

The relationship between the appellant and the respondents broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992.
The facts are more completely set out in the judgment of Dickson J., which judgment is appealed from, in essence, on the following two grounds:
APPELLANT'S POSITION
As result the child's right to be secure in its relationship with its natural parent should not be disturbed.
agree that the principle of non-intervention of Court of Appeal in trial judge's findings of facts does not apply with the same force to inferences drawn from conflicting testimony of expert witnesses where the credibility of these witnesses is not in issue.
There is, however, concern about appropriate access.
The matter is, therefore, remitted to the Family Court to determine reasonable access.
COSTS The trial judge made no order as to costs and the respondents' cross-appeal for costs, here and below.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs here and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access to the child by the mother.

1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child.
2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered.
3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned.

563,"[1] Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Madam Justice E.J. Gunn on April 30, 1999.
Negotiations proceeded slowly and Mr. Marzolf ultimately countered with an application for variation to this court in March 2004.
He seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984.
Mr. Marzolf acknowledges that he has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school.
Again, using the same analysis, his support obligation for two children for the period January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 is $3,290.50.
can only speculate that the sale of the capital asset generated sufficient income for Mr. Marzolf to comfortably support himself.
[26] Based on and as result of the foregoing, the parties should be able to determine the shortfalls in child support paid by Mr. Marzolf during each year and calculate the amount now owing to Ms. Marzolf.
Any mathematical errors in the computations made herein may be corrected with the agreement of the parties failing which they should be brought to my attention.
[27] Ms. Marzolf is entitled to her costs of this application which are hereby set at $2,600.00 which costs shall be paid forthwith.","Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999.
The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month.
The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000.
The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley.
The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school.
The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000.
She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls.
HELD: 1)
The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay.
In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return.
The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income.
To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding.
The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years.
The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2)
The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922.
This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources.
It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount.
Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income.
This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376.
However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424.
The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410.
It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.
This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952.
Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.
 3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345.
It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent.
In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support.
Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.
 4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003.
In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes.
The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003.
Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so.
She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support.
Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.
 5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract.
Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed.
6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted.
No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment.
Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year.
The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7)
In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410.
Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8)
The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","[131, 123, 5, 0, 133, 132, 6, 7, 119]"

1. An order granting her interim sole custody of the three children, with Dr. Hunt being granted reasonable access to the children upon reasonable notice;
2. An interim order preventing Dr. Hunt from removing the children from Saskatchewan without court order or written permission;
3. An interim order requiring Dr. Hunt to pay base child support of $4,617 per month;
5. An order requiring Dr. Hunt to pay interim spousal support of $2,574 per month;

7. An interim order preventing Dr. Hunt from disposing of family property;
8. An interim order requiring Dr. Hunt to make an interim lump sum interim distribution of family property of $20,000.
This is the amount that counsel for Ms. McPhail holds in trust after certain property was sold.
Dr. Hunt deposes in his affidavit that the items sold were his belongings and that Ms. McPhail had stated that she did not want them.
Rather, it is best for this money to remain in trust until final resolution of outstanding issues is achieved.
[37] There has been mixed success.
There will be no order as to costs.","The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse.
She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children.
The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt.
The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him).
They separated in July 2008.
The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997.
The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000.
HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children.
The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits.
The determination will have to be made after trial.
2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation.
The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case.
In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay.
The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000.
Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth.
The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested.
A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems.
The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term.
A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount.
The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.
 3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court.
It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner.
The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","[11, 13, 10, 9, 15, 14, 184, 6, 176, 188, 187, 16, 177]"

[11] was quoted incorrectly as 2010 SKQB 30 (CanLII), [2010]
It should read [2011]","The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit.
The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses.
The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord.
The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment.
The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement.
The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision.
The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable.
HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed.
1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response.
The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.
 2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable.
The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.
The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space.
The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses.
The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer.
Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","[140, 145, 144, 0, 8, 12, 143, 9, 137, 2, 18, 16, 13, 138, 4, 132, 23, 21]"
566,"[1] The respondent, Jason Shire (“Shire”), was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.
[2] The charges arose out of an incident that occurred at Kenosee Lake, Saskatchewan, on November 12, 2004.
The trial was held in the Provincial Court at Carlyle, Saskatchewan, on September 28, 2005.
At trial, charge of possession of marihuana, contrary to s. of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 was stayed by the Crown.
The respondent was acquitted of the Criminal Code charges.
[20] In the instant case, it is clear from the reasons of the trial judge that the officer ought to have had reasonable suspicion of impaired driving and there is evidence to support this conclusion and the trial judge fairly outlined his reasons for the same.
Had he proceeded with quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in short period of time, that may have been reasonable violation of the accused’s Charter rights.
It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching Shire’s vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where Shire was detained and he had further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle.","The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.
The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code.
At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately.
On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made.
The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported.
Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights.
It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle.
In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights.
The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","[2, 114, 3, 5, 0, 4, 115, 112]"
567,"[2] The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge.
To facilitate an understanding of this oral judgment brief recitation of the facts will suffice.
[3] Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase mobile home.
Nickel did sell the mobile home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson.
Section 28(1) provides that “when collateral is dealt with or otherwise gives rise to proceeds, the security interest continues in the collateral unless the secured party expressly or impliedly authorizes the dealing.
In other words the security interest in the collateral does not continue when the secured party authorizes expressly or by implication the dealing.”
In this case the trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing.
[13] In light of this finding it is also not necessary for us to deal with the claim for priority of the Credit Union based on s.30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.
By declining to deal with this matter we are not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge.
[2](1984) 1984 CanLII 2337 (SK QB), 35 Sask. R. 166 (Q.B.) approved in (Sask. C.A.) 1985 CanLII 2883 (SK CA), [1987]","The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2).
Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home.
The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full.
Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson.
The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds.
Lanson attempted to seize the home.
The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.
 HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet.
The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security.
2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization.
Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral.
The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.
3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale.
Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale.
The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.
 4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds.
There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party.
5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing.
It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer.
The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.
 6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","[57, 2, 58, 3, 52, 53, 51, 60, 7, 4]"

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:
It is limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
The Tribunal dismissed the appellant's appeal from the decision of Hearing Officer finding that the appellant was not entitled to temporary total disability payments under the Workers' Compensation Act, S.N.S. 1994-5, c. 10 (the Act).
The appellant alleged that he suffered left knee injury on July 25, 1988 while performing activities for his employer.
In various decisions, the Board refused benefits on the ground that the appellant did not suffer an injury by accident arising out of or in the course of employment.
The Tribunal's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal was rendered prior to the decision of this Court in Doward v. Workers' Compensation Board (N.S.) (1997), 1997 CanLII 14985 (NS CA), 160 N.S.R. (2d) 22.

[2] Apart from the length of the redemption period and the upset price that should be included in any order for sale, the issue is whether this 10 acre parcel of land is a homestead within the meaning of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c.

Kyle Cater TRIAL DECISION
JUDGE: The Honourable Anne S. Derrick
He lived with his mother, Barbara Cater, on Purcells Cove Road, also in Spryfield.
Intercepted private communications constitute the primary evidence offered against Kyle Cater on all the charges.
[11] The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the case and never shifts to the accused.
[15] The key evidence on the firearms possession charges are the intercepts.
The intercepts are also of pivotal importance to the firearms trafficking charges.
N.S.J. No. 708 (Crown application for summary dismissal of Garofoli application/Defence application for leave to cross-examine Affiant); R. v. Cater, [2011]
In drawer in the kitchen table police found, and Cpl. Cameron seized, four 20 gauge shotgun shells.
[197] Kyle Cater is charged that he had possession on or about December of .45 calibre handgun.
Operability is necessary component of finding that “barreled weapon” is in fact “firearm” as defined in section of the Criminal Code.
[201] Assessing whether the intercepted communications concerned “firearms” as this is defined by the Criminal Code requires me to take in account all the evidence.
Michael Press identified the guns shown lying on blanket with ammunition scattered around them.
Its meaning simply cannot be stretched that far.","The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.
The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms.
The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms.
A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession.
One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents.
Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm.
It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located.
However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed.
The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others.
The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities.
Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","[0, 7, 62, 63, 3, 1031, 46, 21, 1046, 1020, 1017, 4, 97, 997, 69, 32]"

[2] On August 13, 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition by including claim for spousal support in an amount to be determined in accordance with the Carol Rogerson and Rollie Thompson, Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines ([Ottawa]: Department of Justice, 2008) (“SSAG”).

In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.
In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation.

The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support.
The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

573,"Counsel: The Claimant was self‑represented.
The Claim The Claimant claims $25,000.00 for damages.
 The reason for the claim is ‑""claim for damages‑house sale ‑ disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding.""
The Claimant said this was a minor problem and the Defendants did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past.
The Claimant stated that the bottom of the studs and the sill in the back[store] room were rotted on all four sides of the room and had to be replaced.
Each section of the floor and sub floor that was lifted the Claimant found mould.
The burden of proving the claim pursuant to the civil standard being on balance of probability lies with the Claimant.
If at the end of the day there is no claim in law the Defendant has no obligation to anyone.
What evidence is there that this was visible to the defendants during the time they occupied the home?
What evidence do have the defendants did repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up wood rot?
Even if there was no acknowledgment of any leakage whatsoever in the PC DS, the disclosure statement highlights that the information contained in it as provided by the seller is believed to be accurate, however it may in fact be incorrect.
It states that it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the information in the PC DS.","The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding. 
Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt.
She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation.
When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony.
Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed;
it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation.
The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries.
There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot.
Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","[0, 4, 7, 519, 12, 530, 512, 510, 5, 18, 521, 529]"

The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt.
The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset.
HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father.
He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter.
2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it. 
The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease. 
Damages of $6,500 were awarded.
3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim.
He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years.
Other family members helped with the farming from time to time.
He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment.
4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven.
It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children.
5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim.

576,"[1] Mary Jane Herman, as guardian of three infant children of a deceased single mother has appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children are not entitled to any additional benefits.
The sole issue before the court is whether any additional dependant child care benefits are payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, R.S.S. 1978, c.A-35 when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.
She was not employed and not receiving any income at the time of the accident.
Nor would she have become entitled to an income within six months of the accident if she had survived.
The income replacement benefit, in this case, is zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s. 146(5) is zero.
It merely provides that where there is no surviving spouse or where the deceased victim was, as is the case here, sole parent, and there is more than one dependant child the surviving spouse death benefit under s. 146(1) is payable for the youngest child and the remaining children become entitled to the additional benefit payable under s.146(5).
Where, however, no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s. 146(3) no further amount is payable under either s. 146(5) or s. 147(5).
[10] The appeal is accordingly dismissed without any order as to costs.","SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother.
The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits.
She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.
Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854.
The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs.
Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5).
It is the total amount payable as a death benefit.
The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero.
Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","[44, 41, 45, 0, 6, 5, 43, 1]"

In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought.
HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.
The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage.
Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609.
Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action.
It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609.

578,"[1] This is an application for an Order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005.
The warrant was based on an Information to Obtain sworn by Paul Patterson, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) officer.
The warrant authorized the search and seizure of the applicant’s accounting records for the period January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003.
The warrant alleged that the applicant, an accountant who runs his business out of his home, filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain tax refund, and misreported HST sales.
An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005 had been basis for prior warrant issued that day.
The May warrant was executed by Mr. Patterson and other CRA officers on May 5.
1. THAT the information Sworn to Obtain the search warrant contains incomplete and misleading information and, in any event, the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the issuance of the search warrant;
(a) anything on or in respect of which any offence against this Act or any other Act of Parliament has been or is suspected to have been committed,","The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period.
The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales.
Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies.
The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties.
Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance;
there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice.
The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file.
There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","[4, 2, 6, 9, 3, 1, 0, 16]"

William M. Leahey, Esq., for the defendant
The dispute in this case is about how to interpret an agreement signed by three brothers in 1988 by which they reorganized their father’s farming operation.
That company was formed in l967.
The first document signed was on June 17th, 1987.
The defendant alleges that the agreement only refers to Fluid Milk Quota, and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of Fluid Milk Quota and not all quota sold.
I would therefore rectify that agreement to read milk quota, which I find includes Fluid Milk Quota and Market Share Quota.
Based on Exhibit Tab 22, it would appear that the amount claimed by each plaintiff is the sum of $399,345.23.
He has no obligation to share quota purchased after 1988, therefore, each plaintiff will be entitled to judgment in the amount of $397,595.23.
Therefore, the plaintiffs would have been entitled to 84.2 percent of any sales made by the defendant of Total Production Quota.

1. There is constitutional right to privacy.
5. Search incident to arrest does include the power to strip search, subject to limitations.
[9] R. C. was arrested in possession of motor vehicle, that had previously been stolen by Scott Tufts and purportedly traded, by Tufts, for drugs.
[45] find that the officers reasonably believed that they had both the legal authority and the necessity to conduct the strip search.
R. C. had been properly arrested for possession of stolen motor vehicle which had arrived at pre-destined location for the purpose of completing drug transaction arranged by Mr. Tufts.
Constable Withrow was also aware of intelligence reports that indicated that R. C. lived in and was associated with areas where the drug trade occurred.
All of the guidelines set out in Golden, supra,
But again, as indicated above, find that nothing of consequence turns on this as the search was minimally intrusive, even by R. C.’s account.
[48] To exclude the evidence, in my view, would call into question the very reputation of the administration of justice.
Therefore, in the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible.
Order Accordingly
Judge of Youth Justice Court","A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction.
The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear.
A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized.
The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive.
There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search.
This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","[226, 232, 22, 223, 4, 233, 18, 1, 5, 211, 214, 225, 9, 210, 235, 37]"

2. Are the two previous incidents of choking which occurred in August and October admissible as similar fact evidence?
589. Count for Murder—No count that charges an indictable offence other than murder shall be joined in an indictment to count that charges murder unless
Although a convincing argument may be made with respect to the reliability of the statements, I do have some concerns about this issue in all of the circumstances.
There is high risk that the jury might conclude that man who previously had choked and sexually assaulted his wife would be disposed to wilfully kill her.
Evidence of the previous bad conduct of Kevin Lenius may distract the jurors from their responsibilities which is to determine whether Kevin Lenius intended to kill the deceased.
That statement, except for the reference to planned and deliberate, is analogous to the case at bar.","Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife.
The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death.
In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been.
In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her.
The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi.
HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible.
The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value.
It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this.
To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value.
In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred.
The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice.
That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime.
There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice.
That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.
There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction.
With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted.
The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify.
However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","[4, 9, 337, 345, 12, 17, 0, 340, 331]"

Defence Counsel Don Murray
[1] The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.
The charges relate to events which occurred on April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively.
[2] This application is brought on behalf of the accused pursuant to s.591 of the Criminal code, the relevant sections of which read as follows:
(a) that the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts.
[21] This disclaimer is indicative, in my view, that the accused’s decision whether to testify would more likely than not be the same in relation to both sets of counts.
[23] Likewise, decline to order severance of the status offences listed in the indictment.
Defence counsel argues that proof of those offences requires evidence of the accused’s prior criminal activity which would be prejudicial to him and which the court need not know about.
There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise.","The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed.
First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.
It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day.
The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events.
The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates.
Application for severance dismissed.
The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn.
The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","[1, 0, 7, 4, 86, 79, 84, 83, 3, 2]"
590,"THE COURT: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.;

They had received additional money on their pay cheques at Trenton Works for overtime they did not work and claimed that they were told by the paymaster not to worry about the irregularity and to give him one-half of the money.
Each gave half of these amounts to the paymaster.
[2] The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud.
The judge was advised that this same recommendation had been made and accepted by another judge in the case of Mr. Fraser, another employee who was part of the same scheme.
The appellants apply for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge’s decision to order restitution of the full amount rather than one-half of the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation.
[4] We would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal.

Decision Delivered: September 5, 2002
BEFORE THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE CROMWELL IN CHAMBERS
[1] R.B. applies to me in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter.
[16] If Chambers judge had jurisdiction to make the order sought by R.B., that authority would be discretionary one.
If this is so, that approach would be immensely preferable to adding party for the purposes of an appeal.
[18] The Family Division not only has intimate knowledge of the permanent care proceedings, but is better equipped to deal with the evidentiary matters which are likely to arise in the course of R.B.’s attempts to place her position before the Court.
The Family Division would also be in the position to deal with the permanent care order on its merits whereas this Court, if persuaded that R.B’s plan for the child should have been heard and considered, would most likely find it necessary to remit the matter to the Family Division for evaluation of her plan for the child.
This would add to delay which the Children and Family Services Act tries to avoid.
Nothing which have said in these reasons should be taken as deciding any of these factual issues.","The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter.
Application dismissed;
a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","[1, 0, 57, 58, 59, 2, 62, 53, 56, 6]"

Having said that, the Court has not been requested to vary the order to sole custody in favor of the mother.

The transfer from the father to the mother shall take place during the Easter weekend as this will be less disruptive for the children.

Primary care and access shall be reviewed by the court on or before September 30th, 2006.
There shall be no direct contact whatsoever between the parties, and any contact necessary to facilitate access should be through third party, such as the grandfather, J.H..
M.R.H. is prohibited from permitting D.R.M.H. and M.H.J.H. to travel in motor vehicle which is not duly registered and insured under the Motor Vehicle Act.
Other reasonable access shall take place as the parties can agree upon from time to time.
Counsel for A.L.H. is kindly requested to prepare an appropriate Court order for signature.
[48] Order accordingly.
Corrine E. Sparks, J.F.C.","Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances.
When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care.
The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability.
The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time.
The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children.
Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","[3, 231, 223, 232, 209, 212, 222, 8, 208, 228, 216, 227, 230]"

[1] The appellant appeared for his trial in matrimonial matter after peremptory adjournment.
[2] The trial judge, in her reasons for judgment, carefully explained the background of the matter.
The trial had been adjourned several times in the past.
The appellant had, during the course of the proceedings, fired one lawyer, and another lawyer had withdrawn.
[3] At trial, the appellant appeared with friend, Mr. Hawke, and told the court that he was incapable of representing himself and that he needed lawyer.
Mr. Hawke was allowed to give evidence on behalf of the appellant after advising the court that the appellant wanted him to give evidence.
[6] We can find no error in the decision of the trial judge.
While the condition of the appellant must be of concern, the evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent himself in court.
In the circumstances, the trial judge had little choice but to do exactly what she did.
In this case, the appellant appeared, but refused to participate.

597,"[1] Where person is killed due to the fault of another, the person’s estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.”
The restriction of damages to “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and the exclusion of damages for loss of expectation of life are at the heart of this appeal.
So, as matter of the legal history of this package of rules, there is no reason to think that claims brought by living persons and those asserted by their personal representatives after death should be treated identically.
[135] The second aspect of the appellants’ point is that it is only just that the estate recover what would have been received by the deceased had he lived to pursue his claim.
Whatever one thinks of these and the many other arguments which are made on this subject, we must remember that this case is not about what the best rule for compensation in wrongful death cases might be.

Counsel: Robert Crosby, Q.C., Counsel for the Applicant
Lisa Fraser-Hill, Counsel for the children, K.B. and C.B.
At the outset of this hearing, the Children’s Aid Society of Cape Breton Victoria (the “Agency”) sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M. requested the continued intervention of the Agency.
The respondent, T.B. did not participate at this disposition review, although he had participated in previous hearings.
The Agency sought to have its involvement terminated.
Lack of disclosure by the Agency was identified as an issue on November 10.
The [...] Agency did little to investigate C.R.B. and her circumstances.
K.B. does not attend school while in C.R.B.’s care.
K.B. does not receive counselling while in C.R.B.’s care.
These are the factors which have considered in conjunction with the other relevant statutory requirements.
The plan adopted by the court in August 2006 was not applied.
[121] L.M. has advised that she is not seeking costs for three reasons.
First, she is represented by Nova Scotia Legal Aid and did not personally incur costs.
Second, she prefers that the Agency’s resources are spent on services for families and children in need.
Third, she feels that the decision stands as sufficient deterrent to the Agency’s blameworthy conduct.","Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies.
Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history.
There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down.
The mother now sought the return of both children.
The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect.
Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation.
Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency.
Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately.
The mother continued to require professional intervention.","[7, 461, 489, 460, 8, 488, 10, 487, 481, 19, 486, 46, 17, 43, 470, 456]"

It is clear that he did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison.
He knew that she was sexually active outside her marriage yet she showed no sexual interest in him.
The other instances described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular work place than with an indication of consent to sexual activity.
do not accept the accused’s evidence and so do not believe him when he says that he honestly believed that she consented to the contact.
He was so aroused and so intent on relieving his sexual energy that he did not care to seek the complainant’s consent to engage in sexual contact.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police.
In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace.
The Crown proceeded summarily.
The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch.
The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her.
The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.
HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office.
1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature.
The complainant did not consent to the contact.
2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature.
The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious.
However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace.
He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison.
When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic.
The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity.
Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact.
The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","[380, 379, 3, 11, 18, 8, 367, 0, 365, 368]"

July 7, 2008","The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006.
He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year.
There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable).
The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards.
The applicant did not have any credit either.
Their home had little, if any, equity.
The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt.
Application allowed.
Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan.

INTRODUCTION
[1] The accused, D.R., is charged with sexual assault of the complainant, C.B., contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
[3] The Crown called three witnesses: the complainant, C.B., her mother, F.B., and her uncle, R.B..
Upon providing her permission, the accused went and got the complainant from his vehicle.
[19] M.R. went to the house after receiving telephone call from J.R. She burst into the bedroom and demanded to know what was going on.
She said that she did not see anything but blankets as it was dark in the room.
She said that she felt dirty, gross, and ugly and stayed inside her friend’s residence for four days.
[21] The complainant’s evidence as to her subjective state of mind is not reliable given her testimony that she has no memory of the events due to an alcohol induced blackout.
[25] Having found that the complainant’s conduct raises reasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consenting, need not consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
IV CONCLUSION
[26] I find the accused, D.R., not guilty.","There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility.
The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment.
The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent.
The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister.
Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication.
It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent.
The accused was found not guilty.","[74, 84, 73, 1, 5, 69, 86, 6, 85, 12, 64, 13, 68]"

David Miller, Counsel for the Defendant MACADAM, J.
In concluding the decision, this court stated:
Counsel have advised that they have been unable to agree on a number of matters related to interest and costs and counsel for the defendant lists as outstanding issues:
1. The apportionment of costs and the effect of settlement offers made by the parties;
The plaintiff submits the passage of time is accountable by the youth of the plaintiff, the normal time to bring case to trial, court delays and the nature of the injuries that she suffered.
If the delay is to be justified because her recovery is less than the doctors had expected, then counsel could never, without risk of being sued, either effect settlement or proceed to trial, until claimant has either totally recovered or the expert opinions on the degree of continuing disability are such as to leave little, if any, chance of being either too optimistic or unrealistic in their assessment of the degree or permeance of disability.
The impact of such position on civil litigation and the resolution of civil disputes is untenable.
The plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to interest for period of three and one-
half years.
J. Halifax, Nova Scotia","The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle.
The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages.
The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement.
In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.
Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs,
that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","[1, 0, 91, 89, 88, 83, 90, 87, 8, 6, 9]"
606,"[1] The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (“PCS”) for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. (the “mine”)
The plaintiff was to supply two instrument technicians to perform electrical instrumentation work at the mine.
The contract was extended by PCS in mid April and then again in June until the end of September, 2005.
[4] The plaintiff alleges that the contract was extended for further three months from September 30 until the end of December 2005.
[7] In addition to Sullivan the plaintiff hired Compton Bird (“Bird”), an apprentice instrumentation mechanic to work at the mine site.
[8] Kusniak claims that on September 20, 2005 he received telephone call from Darren Green (“Green”) who was the instrumentation supervisor of PCS at the mine extending the contract for further three months until the end of December 2005.
Restauronics failed to prove that Ms. Nicholas used any confidential information or trade secrets in preparing her bid.
[77] Aside from the effrontery of Ms. Nicolas’s bid, there is nothing that Restauronics can complain of in this case.
[33] Ryan J.A. then held that Restauronics was not entitled to anything more than nominal damages and awarded it $500.00.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine.
The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff.
HELD: 1)
There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended.
An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends.
He did not prepare the proposals during working hours.
He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina.
However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract.
Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff.
2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal.
There were no union members available for it to hire.
It had no employees ready to perform the contract.
It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December.
If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage.
3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff.
He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets.
He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff.
He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret.
4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","[3, 0, 5, 4, 11, 144, 145, 13, 146]"
607,"Decision: [1] The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce made by Justice Darryl W. Wilson of the Supreme Court (Family Division).
The judge concluded that the appellant was ordinarily resident in Texas for at least seven of the twelve months prior to November 7, 2006 when the petition was filed in Nova Scotia.
As well an order has issued releasing the respondent’s interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property, subject to accounting at later date.
(1) The filing of notice of appeal shall not operate as stay of execution of the judgment appealed from.
(3) An order under rule 62.10(2) may be granted on such terms as the Judge deems just.
It applies only when required in the interests of justice and it is exceptional in the sense that it permits the court to avoid an injustice in circumstances which escape the attention of the primary test.
The risk created by this uncertainty is shared by both the appellant and the respondents.
If, on the other hand, the stay is denied and the appeal ultimately succeeds, the appellant will have been required to pay the judgment needlessly.
[24] I dismiss the application for a stay pending appeal.","Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas.
He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision.
She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here.
She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned.
Application for stay pending appeal dismissed;
the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here.
Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there.
Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","[122, 0, 7, 16, 116, 118, 18, 4, 110]"

CONCLUSION Judgments for the plaintiffs against all defendants, jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.00.
Judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendants Helene Christison and Helene Christison Counselling Inc. in the amount of $15,000.00.
The non-publication order made at trial is lifted as
against the Christison defendants.","Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless.
The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse.
At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports.
HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.
Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.
 1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication.
It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports.
3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.
 4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling.
Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice.
The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice.
The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause.
5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors.
This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act.
Three reports were slanderous.
7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed.
8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive.
9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents.
The negligence claim was dismissed.
10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages.
They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","[1388, 1390, 1392, 1363, 1394, 1355, 43, 9, 1, 1354, 1353, 32, 1352, 4, 1342, 1398, 11, 28, 1348, 41, 29, 1370, 1397, 1341, 33, 1387]"

(2) Whether the law of the foreign court applies, and, if so, whether it differs from local law in any material respects;

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties.
The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract.
HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act.
The application for certification is dismissed on that basis.
1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear.
Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action.
2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999.
strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking.
It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish.
It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361.
It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

OVERVIEW Granview Farms Limited, which is the plaintiff in the present action, is the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies.
This application originally claimed that the issue of CBCL's negligence had been decided by combination of the trial judge's and the Court of Appeal's decisions in the first action.
During oral argument Granview scaled down this claim and argued that only certain aspects of negligence had been decided by the previous decisions in the first action.
As understand the last position of Granview in this application it is that breach of the standard of care, and possibly some aspects of causation should be the subject of res judicata, in other words, issue estoppel.
While it is not technically necessary to decide this second application in view of my ruling on the first application of CBCL, can say would have no hesitation in dismissing this application.
The application of Granview is therefore dismissed.
Costs of $2,500.00 are awarded to CBCL in the first application, plus its disbursements to be taxed if they cannot be agreed upon.

The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy.
The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided.
Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent.
It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary.
The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths.
Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant.
There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation.
HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings.
The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus.
It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","[248, 249, 247, 10, 245, 7, 21, 224, 242]"

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of wrong decision on question of law, or
The only evidence presented relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant.
In such case he ought to have embarked upon consideration of the three elements prescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada.
cannot agree with Crown counsel that the concluding remarks by the trial judge indicated that he was not accepting any evidence of the accused..
In my view, the trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity.
Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to the same conclusion.
Accordingly, I allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial before a judge of the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan.","The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity.
The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed.
The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered.
1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law.
No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.
 2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why.
It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility.
Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault.
Again no miscarriage of justice resulted.
3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity.
The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.
The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality.
The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant.
It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal.

The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle.
The plaintiff remained on the floor until an ambulance arrived.
[4] Certain assertions in the plaintiff's affidavit relating to her injuries and treatment were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination.
The plaintiff acknowledged that there were no laces in her running shoes, but denied that they were badly worn or that they contributed in any way to her fall.
Accordingly, no adverse inference should be drawn by virtue of the fact that the defendant has not filed separate affidavit sworn by Mr. Orban.
[21] I conclude that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.
[22] Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs. ","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000.
The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces.
Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue.
The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier.
The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard.
Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care.
2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor.
The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor.
3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor.
The employee was no longer employed by the defendant.
Neither party was able to locate him.
4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions.
The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice.
The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision.
5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department.
The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping.
A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area.
The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases.
The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries.
To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","[0, 76, 78, 4, 11, 3, 19, 71]"

Consideration of s. 24(2) of the Charter
In Collins, supra, at p. 284 and p. 288,
three primary factors which should guide
the consideration of Court in

These are: (a) does the admission of the

The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence.
The admission of this evidence will not have an adverse effect upon the reputation of the administration of justice.","Following the 'not guilty' pleas, both accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for exclusion of evidence consisting of a knapsack and its contents on the grounds that the knapsack and its contents were obtained in contravention of their rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.
HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied.
1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view.
He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime.
Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items.
The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.

NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
Respondents
REASONS FOR JUDGMENTS BY:","The plaintiff had an abortion at a Halifax clinic.
The plaintiff was in the recovery room for 30 to 45 minutes after the procedure, and then left.
On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle.
She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion.
Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages,
that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","[739, 740, 38, 39, 734, 712, 720, 30, 735, 1, 10, 732, 721, 736, 658]"
619,"Alternatively, the appellant contended that she had erred in her award of costs.
Even then, we are of the opinion the action was destined to fail because, based upon the evidence before the court and the theory advanced by the appellant, the jury could not have found the requisite causal connection between the appellant’s injury and the alleged acts of negligence.
[18] The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within five to six seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle.
That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.
[19] For these reasons, then, the appeal is dismissed to the extent it takes issue with Justice Rothery’s decision to withdraw the case from the jury.
Viewed in this light, we can see no tenable basis for interfering with the award.
Accordingly the appeal is dismissed in this respect as well.
The respondents shall have their costs on appeal, such costs to be taxed in the usual way.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants.
The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants.
The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents.
In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents.
The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered.
Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns.
The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle.
In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury.
On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents.
That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents.
2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","[67, 69, 64, 66, 60, 8, 57, 63]"

C.J.Q.B. In Bankruptcy","Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada.
Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m).
However there was no suggestion of dishonesty.
The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month.
HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge.
1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances.

The preliminary decision of the Court clarifying what the Court would disregard within the affidavits filed by the applicant was provided to the parties prior to the argument of the merits of the application on May 18, 2011.
Pursuant to the provisions of s. 39 of the Act, the powers of the Condominium Corporation are to be exercised and the duties of the Condominium Corporation are to be performed by the Board.
The Court has concluded that principles of contract interpretation have no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of condominium bylaw.
Notwithstanding some of the owners of condominium corporation not being in agreement with certain provisions of the bylaws, those same owners are bound to comply with all of the provisions of the bylaws eventually enacted by that condominium corporation.
[45] As indicated to counsel at the time of the application, if the matter of costs cannot be resolved as amongst the parties, leave is given to the parties to argue the matter of costs at time to be arranged with the Local Registrar.","The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation.
He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners.
The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units.
The remaining 29 units are residential.
The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors.
A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders.
The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board.
HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw.
There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners.
Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.
The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation.

I. Introduction
[1] The Applicants, George Forrester, Phillip Scott, Keith Bowers and R. Gary Cooper (the “Applicants”) are defendants in an action commenced by the Respondent, University of Saskatchewan.
They now seek leave to appeal that decision.
II. Basic Background
will outline only their key features.
[5] In 1986, the University commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss.
[6] The litigation between the University and its insurer moved forward.
Accordingly, in light of the deferential standard of review applicable to proceedings such as the one in issue here, the University contends the Applicants’ proposed appeal is destined to fail.
[15] The standard of review applied in respect of decisions such as the one in issue here will present some difficulty for the Applicants on appeal.
Given my ultimate conclusion with respect to this application, will refrain from saying more about the substance of the Applicants’ arguments or about the University’s position in response to them.
[17] All of that said, appreciate there is an arguable irony in decision granting leave to appeal in case like this because the appeal itself will cause additional delay.
However, this appeal is not particularly complex and it should be capable of resolution within reasonably short timeframe.
Costs will be in the discretion of the panel hearing the appeal.","The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution.
The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan.
The building was substantially completed in 1970.
In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building.
In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss.
In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief.
In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer.
The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997.
Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held.
In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution.
The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant.
HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.
Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","[5, 3, 2, 76, 71, 72, 67, 0, 6, 12, 8, 15, 63, 61]"

The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.
 2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities.
In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility.
It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review.
However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor.
The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","[195, 194, 0, 2, 199, 196, 5, 3, 187, 193, 16, 4, 10, 20, 25, 186, 29, 183]"

and Milan Lawrence Ac
JUDGMENT J. BENISON,
On my view of the evidence, the accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer.
Every 60 days, the tapes are put back into use, thus erasing the previous content.
It is not necessary for the Court to decide whether the RCMP was negligent in erasing the recording after 60 days.
This would only become an issue once the Court determines that the destroyed evidence was relevant.
[15] Applying this principle to the facts in the case before me, note, firstly that the Crown directed stay of proceedings on the impaired driving charge before the conclusion of the trial.
With reference to the remaining charge of driving while over .08, the observations of the accused, the roadside screening demand and the demand for samples of breath all occurred at the roadside and would not have been recorded on video at the detachment.
On the facts of this case, the accused’s rights were not breached by the destruction of the video evidence.
CONCLUSION [16] The Certificate of Analyses filed as Exhibit P-1 is admitted into evidence.
I find the accused guilty of the charge under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08.
The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer.
He did not receive a call back from his wife.
The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available.
The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid.
After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find.
The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.'
The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value.
The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call.
The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape.
The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.
The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter.
Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action.
There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning.
The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer.
The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received.
The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial.
The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside.
The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge.
There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7.
The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","[63, 65, 59, 64, 1, 58, 5, 55, 56, 0, 2, 52, 43]"

Note: Sections 110 and 111 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act contain prohibitions against publication of name or other information that would identify someone as either young person being dealt with under the Act, or as child or young person who is victim or witness in relation to an offence alleged under the Act.
It has been conceded by the Crown, and have found that with this not being violent offence, and with his limited criminal record, Mr. L. is not subject to custody under either sections 39(1)(a), (b), or (c).
The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. R.E.W., provided some guiding principles on the use of s. 39(1)(d) in the following quote:[1]
The exceptional power to commit young person to custody is reserved for those circumstances where, in effect, any other order would undermine the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 38.
An example would be when circumstances of the offence are shocking to the community.

The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody.
The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain.
The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province.
The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","[141, 138, 13, 8, 3, 4, 19, 133, 9]"

DECISION: July 21, 2000.
COUNSEL: John Scott, Esq.,
Reverend Wrenford Bryant Surety
[4] It appears that the accused was arrested in December of 1997 and remanded in custody at the Halifax Correction Centre pending posting of bail which was set at $1,000.00 with a surety.
The accused was released.
He appeared for his preliminary inquiry in September, 1998.
[22] Turning next to the case of the accused, for very different reasons I have concluded as well that forfeiture ought not to be ordered against him.
At the present time he is incarcerated awaiting trial on the matters that are the subject of this recognizance.
Thus, the accused would potentially be liable for a double punishment for his failure to appear for trial which is not acceptable in our system of criminal justice.
[24] Although the accused's conduct in leaving the jurisdiction as he did may be considered to be blameworthy or, at best, reckless, if one accepts his version and deserving of some sanction, in the circumstances have concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.
In my opinion, the accused already has enough on his plate and is experiencing enough negative factors without adding one more which would not be in his or the public’s interest.
[25] Accordingly, the applications for forfeiture are dismissed.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat.
He was released on bail with a surety.
The accused is paraplegic.
He moved to British Columbia after his release.
He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest.
He was arrested and returned to stand trial.
The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited.
It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000.
It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000.
The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default.
Dismissing the applications for forfeiture,
that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities.
In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture.
With respect to the accused, he is impecunious.
His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment.
As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","[125, 120, 2, 115, 0, 1, 16, 11, 6, 17, 111, 126, 121]"
630,"[1] This is an application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision of a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person.
[3] It has been held that once young person makes request of the Youth Court for representation by counsel the language of s. 11(4)(b) on plain reading makes it abundantly clear that the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory (see R. v. T.W.P., [1996]
On April 4, 2001 the young person appeared before the Youth Court judge and requested that the Court appoint him counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.
The young person was facing variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking, failure to attend court, possession of property obtained by crime and obstructing peace officer.
The court held that such broad reading of s. 11(4)(b) of the Act was not warranted and that in the absence of substantive reason for the discharge of his legal aid counsel the court would not appoint counsel at public expense.
[14] Accordingly, I am of the view the learned Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him.","An application for certiorari and mandamus.
In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act.
The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue.
The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer.
He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.
Both parents were on social assistance.
The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed.
The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability.
The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.","[0, 53, 7, 8, 49, 5]"

The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000.
The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn.
The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm.
The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____

1. I am not satisfied that MLG’s desire to question the deponents is based on a real and sincere need to clarify any issues relevant to the applications for which the affidavits have been filed.
3. Virtually all of the reasons cited by MLG to support the request to cross-examine the affiants focus, not on evidentiary issues, but on the relative merits of legal issues.","HELD: The Court dismissed the application.

642,"[1] Sheila Buch appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009.
(c) The Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an Order of Possession of the rental unit in favour of Ms. Buch and the respondent Nathan Buch.
THE LEGISLATION
In this Act:
... (f) “landlord” means person who grants to another person the exclusive right of tenancy to rental unit and includes any of the following:
(ii) pursuant to which the tenant...agrees to pay rent...
3(1) Notwithstanding any other Act but subject to section 5, this Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property.
... 10 Except as modified or varied by this Act or the regulations, the common law applies to tenancy agreements.
(b) the correct legal names of the landlord and tenant;
(c) the address of the rental unit;
Those circumstances do not exist here and conclude that the Hearing Officer did not err in law in deciding she did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute.
have come to this conclusion on the basis that the hearing officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this matter in any respect.","The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession.
The landlords are mother and son.
The mother lives out of province for a number of years.
She returns in summers to reside in the premises.
This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis.
She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease.
She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises.
The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords.
He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises.
HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement.
The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant.
In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute.
However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1)
A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy.
2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement.
Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion.
There was no express consent of principal and agent.
 3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel.
This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.
The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","[14, 15, 17, 4, 8, 197, 0, 195, 5, 20, 21, 7]"

An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended.
The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists.
The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger.
Judgment for the plaintiff;
there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger.
There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","[882, 875, 881, 876, 0, 1, 864, 35, 3, 877, 2, 32, 46, 45, 41, 843, 880, 42, 867]"

HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel.
The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known.
There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8.
It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money.

The Minister is requesting 13 Orders of Production for records prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who have provided services to the Respondent.

Finally, even if document is compellable, the court must determine whether the production of the document is necessary, whether it will save costs, and whether its production will be injurious to the public interest.
The information in the document must relate to fact or proposition at issue.

am not informed by either party about what these records may contain.
The relevant information must be produced notwithstanding the Respondent’s wish to keep it private.
However, it is not necessary to produce all the records.
Since the Minister is requesting all records in its Order of Production deny the request.","The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding.
The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest.
The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means.
In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care.
Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances.
Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings.
However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding.
Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","[2, 247, 250, 8, 19, 13, 7, 240, 248, 237, 34, 12, 0, 232]"

The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.

Gerwing J.A.
[1] This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.
The terms were indeed favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over seven years with most deferred until the final year.
The trial judge in dealing with this point concluded that the contract was not in force until after the meeting when it was delivered to the Clements.
In our view there was probably insufficient evidence to conclude whether or not the contract was indeed effective on her signature or when delivered but in the end result we are of the view that question is irrelevant.
[17] Again, as with the attempts to set aside the contract, the claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis.
The trial judge again made the critical findings of fact.
Each will have costs against the appellant, but all of the Clements will receive one set of costs as will all the named solicitors.
[1] 2005 SCC 25 (CanLII), [2005]
[2] Trial judgment, 2008 SKQB (CanLII) at para. 68.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.
The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement.
The total price was $120,000.
The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year.
There was no interest.
However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes.
The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened.
The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence.
It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to.
2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract.
It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction.
The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract.
The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract.
If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances.
The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","[68, 67, 0, 63, 62, 4, 66, 3, 8, 55, 54]"

of Decision: November 14, 1995
Counsel: Barry Mien for the Appellant
Wayne Harvey for Respondent
The respondent owns several buildings on Robie Street in the City of Halifax.
In the spring of 1994 the respondent's proposal to replace these buildings with high density apartment complex was rejected by Halifax City Council.
The Crown now appeals to this Court.
The Crown raises two grounds on appeal.
This is a reference to land as opposed to buildings.
Subsection refers ""ground covering or other surfaces"" and again this deals with land.
It is only subsection 6 that refers exclusively to the unsightliness of buildings.
They restricted this offence to unsightliness caused only by neglect.
It is interesting to note that subsection 363(3) is recent amendment to the Halifax City Charter.
Unsightly in that subsection cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings because this category is already dealt with in subsection 6.
If the legislators wish to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection would be necessary.
It is suffice to say that any proposed amendment must be drafted in way that does not invoke Section 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.","The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council.
The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter.
At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression.
The city appealed.
Dismissing the appeal,
that the trial judge did not commit an error in law.
S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","[87, 86, 90, 2, 1, 3, 83, 0, 4, 76, 72, 6, 82, 11, 12, 75]"
655,"He testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence.
It follows, in my view, that the conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice and must be set aside.
[3] The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault.
The abuse consisted of touching her vagina with his hand and trying to stick his penis into her vagina.
On an unspecified number of occasions, he succeeded in putting his penis partly into her and on occasion he ejaculated.
After the alleged abuse came to light, she remembered being taken to see doctor, but did not remember how recently before that she had been sexually abused by the appellant.
In chief, the doctor opined that she had seen this type of injury more than 30 times and that she had never seen an injury like it that had not been caused by sexual assault.
A. Yes. Q. And in 1994 you were convicted of break and enter for which you received suspended sentence and 18 months probation.
The record discloses that the complainant was asked precisely that question.
[44] I would conclude, therefore, that the judge’s finding adverse to the appellant as regards his credibility is based on a misapprehensions of the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault.
The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent.
The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food.
There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly.
The appellant appealed.
Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered.
The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic.
The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment.
The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","[241, 228, 10, 14, 1, 11, 4, 242, 6, 12]"
656,"[1] The appellant, Dennis Lawson, applies pursuant to Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order staying execution of spousal support arrears created as result of an interim order.
[2] The order for spousal support was made in the face of written agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Rees gave up her rights to spousal support.
The parties were married on February 3, 2012, but had lived together since June 2010.
They separated in March 2015.
They have one child of their relationship who is three years of age.
First, there is an arguable issue that the Chambers judge’s conclusion that Mr. Lawson’s payment of expenses pertaining to the family home ceased after October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him.
Third, if the order is enforced, Mr. Lawson may be prejudiced.
This is so because Ms. Rees’s means are very limited and thus there is a real possibility she would not be able repay any “overpayment” of spousal support.
Fifth, the imposition of stay with respect to only the spousal support arrears balances the competing interests at stake in the appeal.
IV. conclusion
[11] Costs with respect to this application shall be left to the panel hearing the appeal.","HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted.
There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support.
If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced.
The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","[47, 5, 0, 43, 7, 6, 40, 42, 37, 8, 39]"
657,"[1] In early 2008, Stomp Pork Farm Ltd., major Saskatchewan hog producer, came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors’ Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36.

FCC gave notice of its intention to realize on its security.
National arranged for the appointment of receiver.
In the event of the sale, lease or transfer of barns during the three-year period the acquirer or user had to assume the HTP conditions, including keeping the barns idle, failing which the subsidies would become repayable with substantial administrative fees and interest.
The term “abuse of the process of the court” is term of great significance.
... In determining the reasonableness of the cause of action, Chicoine J. applied the plain and obvious test.
[15] In my opinion this application turns on the interpretation of the impact of the Court of Appeal decision in the CIBC v. Sylvester case, supra.
[16] The defences advanced by National are, as was the situation in the 663073 Alberta Ltd. case, supra, so closely connected with FCC’s demands that it would be manifestly unjust for FCC to proceed without taking National’s defences into consideration.
CONCLUSION [17] Both applications are accordingly dismissed.
Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.","FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process.
HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.
Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","[75, 5, 81, 82, 0, 83, 7, 70, 6, 74, 12]"

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
TRIAL DIVISION
DECISION OF GLUBE, C.J.T.D.","In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice.
The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment.
The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta.
The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months.
He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months.
For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","[323, 6, 8, 11, 9, 5, 2, 322, 13, 304, 305, 321, 319, 326, 12]"
659,"[1] The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, has alleged that the defendant has wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000.00 to which his daughters are entitled.
[2] Mabel Zalys was the mother of the plaintiff and the defendant.
The sum of $500.00 from the account was given to Brenda.
Thus, the principal amount in the account was $25,000.00.
[23] In McPherson v. L’Hirondelle, 1927 CanLII 48 (SCC), [1927]
S.C.R. 429, Newcombe J. for the court stated at p. 435-36:
... [A]n incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely to make a transfer.
Mabel quite clearly, at the time of writing the instructions, wanted Brenda to prepare four cheques in the amount of $5,000.00 each for the benefit of the four granddaughters.
The fact that Brenda did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel’s lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust.
[26] The plaintiff alleged that Brenda “committed fraud upon the infant plaintiffs”.
[28] The claim of the plaintiff is dismissed, with costs to the defendant, to be taxed on the basis of double column 2.","Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled.
Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account.
Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter.
The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children.
The money was never issued to the granddaughters.
The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters.
HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2.
An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer.
Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust.
She intended to make monetary gifts.
The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust.
As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven.
Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","[73, 76, 2, 70, 72, 64, 65, 0, 8, 9, 66]"
660,"IN THE MATTER OF SECTION 49(1) OF THE RESIDENTIAL TENANCIES ACT
and INGRID BJORK
and THE OFFICE OF THE RENTALSMAN
RESPONDENT M. Dean Brown for the appellant
June 5, 2003
[1] This is an appeal by Paul Maley, the tenant, from the decision of the Rentalsman dated April 9, 2003.
Further, at the hearing of the matter, and without prior notice to the tenant, the landlord applied to amend its claim to total of $3,764.46 and provided written particulars of the expanded claim.
[6] The hearing notice received by Mr. Maley in this case set out the specific amount for cleaning that the landlord was requesting, that is, the sum of $2,241.45.
Mr. Maley could, if he had chosen to do so, have sought out skilled house cleaner prior to the hearing by the Rentalsman and had that person attend with him to consider the evidence that was going to be presented by the landlord (including the pictures that Mr. Maley was aware would be shown).
 It is, therefore, my view that Mr. Maley was not denied natural justice and due process in this matter.
The Rentalsman reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not patently unreasonable given that evidence.","FIAT. After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities.
The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01.
The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence.
The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process.
While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting.
The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","[39, 36, 32, 3, 0, 2, 6, 1, 29, 35, 7]"
661,"[1] The petitioner seeks child support and spousal support.
With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on division of income until July 1, 2011.
[2] The respondent worked as computer consultant.
[3] The interspousal contract provides, inter alia:
The actual amount of the expenses may be somewhat more or somewhat less than the actual amount of $35,000.00.
The adjustment will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul’s contract is renewed with the Provincial Government.
7.5 The one half division of income shall continue up to and including June 30, 2007.
The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of Brenda’s income that she has earned.
[16] Insofar as the respondent’s income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000.00 per annum.
There is reference to some expenses being incurred to earn the income but there is no information as to what those expenses are.
The respondent did provide “pay stub” for May 2006.
This is in sense, an interim order and the question of the respondent’s income for child support purposes can be addressed at the pre-trial conference.","The petitioner seeks child and spousal support.
The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004.
With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1)
The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum.
The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance.
It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'.
This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support.
The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist.
2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program.
Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year.
The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006.
It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000.
Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","[123, 0, 3, 10, 2, 18, 7, 120, 121, 119, 15, 16]"

(b) When Divorce Judgment is obtained, all the terms of this Agreement shall survive the Divorce Judgment and continue in force.
The Applicant’s conduct throughout these proceedings was not so reprehensible or distasteful to warrant such rebuke.
have taken into account also the considerable financial disclosure that the two applications required of the Respondent and the length of each Court appearance and the average complexity of the issues that were before the Court.
therefore order the Applicant pay to the Respondent costs, inclusive of disbursements, in the sum of $6,500.00.","Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement.
Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support.
The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years.
She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000.
The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent.
Application dismissed;
the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed.
Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","[7, 12, 319, 3, 10, 318, 2, 314, 29, 18]"

The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay.

The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay.
The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","[578, 577, 574, 571, 576, 575, 17, 15]"

The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated.
The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008.
The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return.
She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year.
The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income.
It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months.
It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have.
The severance is included as part of the father's income.
2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income.
The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division.
The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains.
See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177.
3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.
 4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income.
However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment.
As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5)
The mother shall have her costs of $600.","[0, 9, 115, 118, 5, 15, 123, 119]"

JUDGMENT BAYNTON J.
February 18, 2000
[1] The applicant applies to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support.
The amount he is required to pay under the 1995 judgment is $2,500.00 per month.
[2] The application before me was triggered by the applicant’s loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury.
[3] The affidavit material filed by the parties indicates that they have different views as to many of the issues involved and their respective needs and means, but neither wanted trial of the issue.
agreed to determine the issue on the basis of the materials filed in chambers keeping in mind the extensive inquiries mandated by Bracklow v. Bracklow, 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999]
[25] It is ordered that commencing April 1, 2000, the ongoing spousal support payable by the applicant to the respondent shall be $1,750.00 per month up to and including March 1, 2001.
From and after April 1, 2001 until further order, the amount of spousal support shall be $1,250.00.
[26] There is no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent.
It is essential that he know now what his future obligations will be.","The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month.
The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP.
Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed.
HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.
 1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts.
The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.
 2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension.
3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions.
However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired.
The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home.
She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property.
The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge).
There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","[2, 0, 93, 94, 8, 95, 9, 3, 97, 6, 7, 5]"

This is an application by Debbie A. Smith for interim maintenance.
The parties were married on April 9, 1983.
There are no children of the marriage.
Ms. Smith has been employed at K‑Mart as clerk for fifteen years.
His annual salary is $36,817.00.
She claims that during their marriage, she spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant.
She claims that it was agreed that if she had child, she would not continue her employment.
The factors to be considered are the means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse including the length of time the parties cohabited.
The parties lived together as husband and wife for just over five years following the marriage, however, there was period of two additional years prior to marriage when the parties resided together as common law spouses.
In my opinion, Ms. Smith should attempt to upgrade her education.
Ms. Smith will no doubt have to invest her proceeds from the matrimonial home so that she receives monthly income.
I award the sum of $100.00 per month interim maintenance.

670,"The defendant seeks to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim.
FACTS [2] On March 23, 1990, the plaintiff was injured when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant’s store.
The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000.
It lasted for parts of 12 days.
On November 22, 2000, the defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000.00 plus taxable costs.
Without attempting to encroach upon the authority or jurisdiction of the taxing officer and in the hope that the parties may receive some benefit therefrom and come to some agreement, the following comments are offered.
The pre-trial conference attendance charge in most cases is intended to include brief.
charge of $50.00 for each management pre-trial conference is recommended with total limit of $500.00 for all such conferences.
In this case the transcripts proved to be of considerable value to the Court in reconciling and comparing the evidence of medical experts of similar qualifications relating to specialized field.
It is recommended that the plaintiff’s expenses in having the transcripts provided to the Court be recovered from the defendant.
[28] Costs payable by the plaintiff to the defendant on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff’s Bill of Costs.","FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store.
The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43.
The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused.
The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to.
The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports.
At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed.
HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success.
Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs.
Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party.
2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages.
3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value.
Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case.
Expenses of each was examined separately.
In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant.
4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee.
A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel.
The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case.
Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court.
It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.
Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","[163, 164, 1, 150, 2, 5, 162, 3, 155, 4, 144]"

673,"Written Decision and
Decision on Costs: February 28, 2008
Counsel: William L. Ryan, Q.C., for the Applicant
By the Court:
[1] The applicant, Elaine Brooks seeks an order removing the executor, Alexander Finlayson, pursuant to s.61(1)(b)(v) of the Probate Act.
Mrs. Finlayson died on April 15, 2004.
[2] At the time of her death, Mrs. Finlayson was registered owner of certain Royal Bank of Canada shares.
In September 2005, the executor applied to the Probate Court for hearing to show cause why the testator’s interest in those securities should not be treated as an asset of the estate or, in the alternative, subject to certain trusts.
As result, the terms of the will are allegedly not being met, and the interests of beneficiaries are being prejudiced.
As was the case in Re J.J., it is my view that, although Mr. Finlayson has difficulties with vision and hearing and lacks clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executor, believe, based on all the evidence, that he has sufficient presence of mind to instruct counsel in the circumstances.
[28] Counsel on behalf of Ms. Brooks submits that costs should be in the cause.
Counsel on behalf of the estate claim that the estate has incurred disbursements as follows:
Office Administration 60.00
Travel 90.00
Total $244.32
Plus HST of 14 percent for disbursements payable in any event in the cause.","The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased.
Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor.
Application to remove the executor dismissed;
there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","[167, 165, 160, 2, 4, 0, 5, 157, 164, 8, 159, 11, 1, 152, 20, 13]"
674,"The accused Smith was in the entrance hallway.
These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants.
1) Conspiracy to possess marihuana for the purpose of exporting it contrary to s. 6(2) of the CDSA and s. 465(1)(c) of the Code;
5) Participating in the activities of criminal organization contrary to s. 467.11 of the Code.
[47] It is now appropriate to consider, more particularly, the third and final consideration in the Collins Test, that is, whether the exclusion of the evidence in all the circumstances would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
While the expectation of privacy that the accused had with respect to his private residence is high, nevertheless, the nature and circumstances of the Charter s. breach in this case, combined with the “circumstances” the court has reviewed respecting how the Warrants were prepared and executed, are factors which have led this Court to conclude that the violations of the accused’s s. Charter rights in this case were of less serious nature when compared to the circumstances reviewed by other courts leading them to conclude that the evidence obtained must be excluded.
[48] As Lamer C.J.C. commented in R. v. Jenereau, 1992 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1992]
This is the same conclusion have reached with respect to the evidence obtained in all of the circumstances of this case.
Therefore, the application of the accused to exclude the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter is dismissed.","The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search.
The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights.
HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.
 1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid.
That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2)
The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued.
The search was therefore warrantless.
3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair.
4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants.
The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA.
The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis.
5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","[212, 218, 7, 216, 220, 20, 24, 16, 215]"

After payment of the first mortgage, real estate commission and municipal taxes to the date of sale there would, no doubt, be modest surplus accruing to the registered owners.

1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement.

There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor.

[2] Accordingly, this judgment applies to both Q.B.G. No. 1040/1998 and Q.B.G. No. 1041/98.
[3] There are two contracts that play in this case:
PRIVITY OF CONTRACT
[5] The defendants have pleaded that there is no privity of contract between the plaintiffs and the City of Regina and that the plaintiffs are thereby prevented from enforcing the terms as agreed by the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings.
[8] It is not clear from the evidence whether all the parties intended that all contracts and arrangements be taken as one overall agreement and enforced accordingly.
[20] The plaintiffs rely on s. of the 1997 Tender for Rental of Trucks Specifications.
The damages claimed by the plaintiffs are excessive and do not properly take into account:
(a) Actual operating expenses for the time complained about;
(c) reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.
[24] Even if the case on entitlement had been made out the damages could not have been properly determined without further evidence or representation.
RESULT [25] Accordingly, each case is dismissed.","This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants.
The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association.
The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract.
Both matters were tried together.
The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P.
HELD: Both actions were dismissed.
1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity.
While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association.
2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work.
The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference.
The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs.
They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.
 3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required.
The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","[1, 34, 0, 35, 2, 33, 31, 25, 30, 6, 7, 10]"

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered by:
The appellant applies for leave to appeal from sentence of two years less one day and an order of two years probation imposed on May 8, 1990, by the Honourable Judge MacDonnell.
The appellant entered guilty plea to charge of aggravated assault contrary to Section 268(1) of the Criminal Code.
The offence was committed at Joggins where, late in the evening and while intoxicated, the appellant fired shots from his 12‑gauge shotgun, first at the mobile home wherein the parents of his estranged wife lived and, second, at his brother‑in‑law, who was injured in the leg.
The latter was admitted to hospital for treatment.
The appellant contends the trial judge erred by placing undue emphasis on general deterrence and failing to adequately consider the circumstances of the offence and the offender.
The acts of the appellant placed the lives of several persons at risk, particularly that of his brother‑in‑law.

These are the reasons.
[2] The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order.
The application to vary, made about year later, was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines.
[3] The judge hearing the application to vary was faced with conflicting affidavits.
This decision gave rise to the first ground of appeal.
We can find no reversible error in the judge’s decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant’s arguments respecting that issue.
[7] The expenses in question related to activities such as swimming, hockey, soccer, gymnastics, snowboarding and music.
Absent any evidence to the contrary, it seems to us that the activities were ordinary activities and the expenses were of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of these children’s parents.
Accordingly, the judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s. 7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s. 3(1)(a).
In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.
Each party shall bear his and her own costs.

The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children.

In Concurrence: The Honourable Chief Justice Klebuc
The Honourable Madam Justice Hunter
The offence took place in Yorkton.
The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck the respondent was driving when he was arrested.
[2] The respondent was nearly 22 years old at the time of the offence and had no prior record.
[3] The sentencing judge referred to authorities with an accused of similar age, or with drugs of similar street value.
is the lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession of any property or any part of any property that would otherwise be forfeited pursuant to an order made under subsection 16(1) or 17(2) and that the person appears innocent of any complicity in an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or of any collusion in relation to such an offence, the court may order that the property or part be returned to that person.
[15] Parliament clearly intended that the proportionality test does not apply to personal property under the provisions of the Act.
Section 490.41(3) reads as follows:
[17] The Crown is therefore granted leave to appeal, the appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed and the appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed.
[2] Sentencing transcript at pp. 37-38.
[4] Ibid. at pp. 39-40.","The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition.
The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them.
The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.'
HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal.
1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed.
2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed.
The truck is ordered forfeited.
1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.
 2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA.
It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence.
The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA.
Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration.
However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited.
The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.
In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession.
The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so.
He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","[86, 0, 87, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2, 84, 10, 77, 79, 69]"
684,"[6] On July 31, 2008 the accused appeared with counsel, Mr. Andrew Pavey.
[60] Mr. L. claimed not to have appreciated the affect of his plea on his future contact with his son (see his affidavit s. 8).
[62] In his affidavit, Mr. Pavey indicated that Mr. L. was aware of the agreed condition of sentence that he not have contact with his son.
[68] Mr. Josey testified that he’d been probation officer for 25 years.
If Mr. L. professed innocence of the crime or offered an innocent explanation such as his teaching his son to clean his penis as his father taught him such information would seem extremely relevant and worthy of inclusion in the PSR by the author thereof.
[70] Mr. L.’s expression of remorse to Mr. Josey may, in part, have been motivated by the troubles he’d caused his family.
If so it does not affect the Court’s view of his evidence, or the Court’s conclusions.
[71] Taking all of the foregoing into consideration the Court has come to the conclusion that the test in Nevin, supra, has not been met and, therefore, the application of the accused to withdraw his guilty plea ought to be dismissed.","The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea.
He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son.
The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography.
Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed;
the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault.
The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","[248, 253, 252, 235, 238, 249, 251, 24]"

(b) costs of the within application.
[2] The other two applications are brought by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as party with the consent of the applicant.
That provision enables the extracts to be filed to prove what was said, but not as proof that the remarks were true.
The same applies to the extracts from Hansard and the transcript of the radio broadcast.
[21] It is alleged that there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart.

In the same vein, Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath.
[23] Without such evidence it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias.

He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour.
He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour.
When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application.
Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart.
It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart.
The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart.
HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed.
The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.
 1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit.
This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility.
The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents.
2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents.
There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.
 3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart.
Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations.
Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart.
However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them.
Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath.
Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias.
To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy.

That company assigned its agreement with Eastside to Direct Cash and their subsequent contractual relationship is the subject matter of this dispute.
It appears Direct Cash’s claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act (the Act).
[24] Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court’s jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment.
[25] Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process in this action, I find the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small Claims Court Act.
CONCLUSION [26] Accordingly, I dismiss the Appeal.

The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract.
The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out.
The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court.
The claimant appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","[86, 85, 87, 8, 88, 1, 4]"
687,"v. Nova Scotia Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal
and Canadian Manufacturers Exporters Association
Intervenor Judges: Cromwell, Saunders and Oland, JJ.A.
Saunders and Oland, JJ.A. concurring.
Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) Policy 1.3.6 mandates this sort of objective approach.
[5] The worker submits that WCAT erred in three respects:
(i) in finding that the worker\'s subjective reaction to external stressors in the workplace was not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA;
(iii) in rejecting and failing to give adequate weight to the opinion of the worker's treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to the contrary to rebut that opinion.
[6] There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal.
WCAT also erred, the worker says, by failing to give GECA the sort of broad and liberal interpretation that should be accorded to workers’ compensation legislation.
Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, however, WCAT did not find that there were “unusual or excessive” stressors in the workplace which could ground claim for gradual onset stress.
[45] Again, at page 17 of its reasons, WCAT stated:
In light of that finding, for which there is plausible support in the record, the worker’s claim for gradual onset stress could not succeed.","The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy.
The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant.
Appeal dismissed;
the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress.
The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","[23, 4, 25, 19, 7, 0, 186, 3, 22, 26, 182, 35, 178]"
688,"He was therefore charged with having committed certain offences during period of time, […], 1985 to December 31, 1989, when he was an adult.
It is common ground that youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to any offences which occurred after the date he became an adult.

[19]Supra, Note 14 ar p. C&A: 106.","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult.
The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue.
The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency.
The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult.
The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989.
The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court.
The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision.
It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult.
HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court.
Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.
 1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges.
If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth.
The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.
 2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application.
R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","[5, 7, 4, 16, 183, 182, 19, 21, 10, 8, 181]"

The Honourable Madam Justice Hunter
Smith J.A. [1] This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial.
[2] The respondent was charged with total of 29 offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007.
Most of these were summary conviction offences, in general arising out of multiple failures to comply with various bail conditions including: breach of curfew (five charges), failing to attend school (two charges), failing to reside in designated residence, failing to not possess, keep or consume alcohol (four charges) and failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour (four charges).
He was also charged by information with various offences in relation to drinking, driving, leaving the scene of an accident and possession of stolen vehicle and two charges of obstruction of peace officer by providing false name.
The appeal to this Court relates to the finding that the respondent is unfit to stand trial in relation to these offences.
It does, however, represent the information before the Court in relation to the relevant allegations.
[43] In her concluding paragraph the trial judge found that Mr. Jobb is unable to recount the facts of his offences “in such way that counsel may prepare defence”.
The conclusion, in any case, that Mr. Jobb did not have the ability to testify as to the facts of the charges against him is contrary to the evidence of Dr. Menzies.","The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial.
The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions.
He was also charged with two indictable thefts.
He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse.
He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment.
He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board.
The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea.
The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel.
The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered.
The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code.
The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test.
The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness.
This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes.
Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests.
The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","[3, 2, 278, 0, 274, 5, 11, 7, 27, 6]"
691,"[1] The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order granted by Justice R. S. Smith on February 2, 2007.
[2] The respondent opposes the application and says that there has been no material change of circumstances since the granting of the parenting judgment and child support order on February 2, 2007.
The respondent’s evidence is that she has provided generous access to the petitioner since the birth of the twins.
[6] The child support order determined that the petitioner’s income for Guideline purposes was $53,624 and the respondent’s was $54,581.
That, in my opinion, is not a material change of circumstance as the change of the petitioner’s income on equal parenting were clearly provided for in the original child support order and parenting judgment.
I therefore dismiss the petitioner’s application to vary the child support order.
[18] find that the petitioner’s 2009 income for child support purposes is $77,060.
The petitioner therefore owes the respondent $420 for child support as he appears to have paid only the original $762 per month.
The $420 is to be paid by the petitioner within thirty days.
She is therefore entitled to her costs, which fix in the amount of $1,500 to be paid within thirty days.","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins.
The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order.
The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent.
The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner.
The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children.
For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time.
The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children.
The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis.
The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come.
The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children.
HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement.
The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children.
The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement.
The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order.
The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased.
The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed.
The respondent was awarded costs.","[1, 5, 78, 83, 84, 86, 77, 76, 16, 13]"

 In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property.
HELD: 1)Divorce was granted.
The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998.
2)They agreed to joint custody of both children.
The son was to reside primarily with his father.
The daughter resided with her mother.
Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends.
The children were to be together most weekends.
School vacations would be shared.
3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance.
Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense.
The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance.
4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003.
The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers.
She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing.
5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale.
Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale.
The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.

694,"Counsel: Kimberlie Ann Thomson, self‑represented
By the Court:
[1] Kimberlie and Paul Thomson were married on April 29, 1995, and separated in December in 2002.
In week two, Mr. Thomson picks up his children Thursday after school and returns them to Ms. Thomson Sunday evening.
The remainder of the time the children reside with their mother.
For the last five years, the parents have shared child care cost of $800.00 per month.
If that were to be the case, Mr. Thomson would be required to pay 46% of the cost.
[31] With regard to apportioning this expense, have considered the following: 1)
This payment would normally be made through the Maintenance Enforcement Program, however, will leave it to the parties and, more specifically, Ms. Thomson to indicate if that is her preference as to receiving the child support.

695,"2) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.
(b) Owner, directly or indirectly, by agency or otherwise, bids or permits another to bid on Owner’s behalf on the Property or any part thereof at the auction; or
(e) Owner fails to prepare auction site in timely manner, as set out in Clause 3.10; then:
4.11 Collection of Proceeds Auctioneers shall collect the full proceeds from the sale of the Property and Owner assigns to the Auctioneers:
65 Under the amended terms of the original contract DBM had the right to retake the goods in any of the circumstances there stipulated.
The contractual provisions confer licence, exercisable in certain circumstances to enter the premises of the plaintiff where the goods are situate.
109) The plaintiff’s claim for damages for trespass and conversion must be dismissed.
(2) In all other respects, the plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs, to be determined on a solicitor client basis, upon further application by the defendants under Rule 565 as herein directed.","The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.
The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500.
The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie).
The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie.
After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price.
The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds.
The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit.
HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf.
The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit.
A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public.
The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit.
2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit.
It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid.
It actively facilitated bidding.
Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment.
The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose.
It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs.
The plaintiff corporation benefited.
It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract.
'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner.
3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction.
That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information.
He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle.
All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered.
He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4)
In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation.
The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants.
In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.
 5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages.
The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized.
The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6)
The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract.
The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum.
The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument.
The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7)
The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff.
In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","[18, 496, 495, 493, 16, 503, 5, 468]"
696,"divorce hearing was held on October 13, 2009 and November 2, 2009.
The parties have effected division of their former matrimonial property.
They concluded an agreement, described in its body as “separation agreement/minutes of settlement” on October 22, 2008.
The agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on June 17, 2009.
It is agreed, however, that since May of 2009, the children have been primarily resident with the Respondent mother.
Issues [4] The main issues for the court’s consideration are the spousal and child support obligations of the Petitioner, Mr. Grady and whether they are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgment.
[6] Ms. Grady filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce on September 15, 2009.
[69] The court is not prepared to rewrite the parties’ agreement or disregard it, given all of the circumstances and the jurisprudence.
[70] It is the parties who are best equipped to renegotiate the agreement if it is necessary that the renegotiation occur.
Mr. Grady’s continuing default is not in the interest of either party.
am more inclined to the view that Mr. Grady’s proposal for changing/disregarding the agreement would bring about this result.
understand the parties have agreed upon modifications to the parenting agreement and less significant issues.","The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008.
It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time.
At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment.
The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support.
He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement.
The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce.
The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008).
The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable.
He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife.
The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement.
This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act.
It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome).
The terms of the agreement must be given great deference.
Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act?
The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made.
Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult.
Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated.
Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party.
To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them.
The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it.
The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements.
His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","[323, 321, 1, 6, 13, 329, 331, 3, 324, 4, 12, 17]"

INTRODUCTION
[1] Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“the Charter”) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.
I find that there was no Charter breach and I dismiss the application.
(a) commit an assault on [K.J.], contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code;
(c) July 31, 2003 the accused first appeared in court.
[16] The accused argues that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking he was subject to prevents him from contacting the complainant and it is therefore argued that he was prevented from having access to his children in her care.
These offences occurred on July 5, 2003, July 23, 2003, and January 29, 2004.
These offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter proceeding to trial, and there is no evidence about how this causes the accused an undue hardship which is different from that faced by other accused charged with similar offences.
find that other accused have no standing in this application and that it is only this accused’s rights which are appropriately considered in this application.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.
The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code.
On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court.
The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources.
On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004.
On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004.
HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed.
1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months.
This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry.
2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children.
There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this.
3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking.
As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused.
3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","[62, 0, 73, 1, 67, 66, 6, 14, 3, 2]"
700,"This is an appeal by Future Inns Canada Inc. from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and refusing to reconsider the first two orders.
The last two named respondents did not appear at the appeal.
She often checked rooms personally.
If rooms were not properly cleaned, the housekeeper would be sent back, and in the case of repeated deficiencies, reprimands and ultimately dismissals followed.
On the following Monday, Ms. Lemire found that room cleaned by the respondent, Gloria Rafuse, was not properly done.
Ms. Lemire told her she was dismissed.
The order of the Board imposes significant monetary liability upon Future Inns.
Failure to comply with the order also renders Future Inns subject to prosecution.

Respondents","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union.
The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision.
Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing,
that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record.
In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial.
As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","[407, 408, 412, 381, 380, 19, 405, 17, 3, 392, 385, 406, 36, 16, 1]"

The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee.
The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem.
The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'.
HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child.
2)Spousal support was denied.
3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.
 4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan.
The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method.
The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP.
The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP.
The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options.
If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","[1, 2, 5, 6, 4, 361, 3, 362, 368, 13, 353, 11, 367, 7, 359, 360, 40, 10, 369, 14, 31, 322, 320, 370, 356, 29, 44]"

In this manner, they should choose an extracurricular activity or activities which best suit Madison’s needs and interests while also being reasonably affordable and causing the least, or no, disruption to the parenting regime mandated by this judgment.
As consequence, each party shall bear their own costs.","The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina.
The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school.
Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent.
The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application.
The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents.
The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child.
The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make.
HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child.
The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent.
The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents.
The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's.
Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan.
The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain.
The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina.
The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime.
The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend.
The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays.
The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two.
The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year.
Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days.
The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","[0, 5, 6, 453, 461, 442, 29, 448, 436, 467, 7, 464, 26]"

APPLICATION ON APPEAL
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
APPEAL DIVISION
Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: MACDONALD, J.A.","This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother.
The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance.
The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child.
Allowing the appeal,
that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act.
Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible.
It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children.
In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born.
The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","[182, 183, 20, 4, 16, 17, 186, 1, 14, 9, 21, 181, 178, 8]"

[1] On January 24, 2002, this matter was heard in chambers and I reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs for the following reasons:(a) The two motions which were served by the plaintiffs on the defendants returnable for January 24, 2002, were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by The Queen’s Bench Rules;
(b) The motion which was filed at the Court House returnable January 24, 2002, was not served on the defendants; and
[2] Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed.
There was request by the defendants’ counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs.
[4] Given Mr. Tapp’s representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, I do not believe it would be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time.

707,"FACTS [1] The plaintiff, Glenrose Farms (“Glenrose”), purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 (the “Spreader’), from the defendant, Apollo Distributing Corporation (“Apollo”), on December 1, 1999.
The defendant, Meyer Mfg. Corp. (“Meyer”) manufactured the Spreader.
After he saw the equipment in use, he ordered the larger 5570 model.
[16] In order to reject the Spreader and obtain refund of any moneys paid, pursuant to the Act, the plaintiff must comply with s. 36.3.
Pursuant to s. 36.3(c) the dealer must make the implement perform well within seven days following receipt of the written notice.
If the purchaser has provided the required written notice and the dealer has not taken necessary steps to make the implement work well, the purchaser may, upon giving further written notice, reject the implement.
Further, based upon the evidence presented, I cannot find that “the dealer or distributor, either before or after the expiration of the time limit (did) any act or so conduct(s) himself, as to lead(s) the purchaser to believe that the notices are not required to be, or to have been given” as stipulated in s. 36.3.
[18] Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim as against the defendant Apollo is dismissed.
Costs are awarded to the defendant.","The plaintiff bought a spreader from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo).
The defendant Meyer Mfg. Corp. (Meyer) manufactured the spreader and did not defend the action.
The plaintiff claims that the spreader was entirely unfit for spreading compost and did not meet the warranties imposed by The Agricultural Implements Act.
The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.
The plaintiff did not establish that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost or that it was not manufactured in compliance with the warranties in the Act.
1) Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff addressing the cause of breakage.
2) If deficiencies did exist in the spreader, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing.
The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader.
3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act.
The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","[3, 85, 90, 89, 83, 0, 86, 88, 7]"

[2] The relevant facts are as set out in the Crown brief:
The accused himself testified that on the date in question he was parked near the Knot Pub in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.
On the way he stopped and picked up eight cans of beer, then drove to the Car Bright car wash, where he parked.
As the Pub was about to close he and his friend went to his vehicle.

O.J. No. 197, 2004 CarswellOnt 315 (Ont. C.A.).
[14] From the cases cited, conclude that the risk assessment, as an element of care and control, should include an assessment of the risk of the accused changing his mind; in other words, it is relevant, although not necessarily sufficient, consideration.","The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit.
The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in.
The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house.
Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged.
From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a).
Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","[58, 62, 7, 63, 1, 0, 2, 4]"
711,"[1] Thank you to both counsel for providing their arguments and extensive authorities.
[5] To pursue the fishing analogy so often used in the authorities, the purpose of such an inquiry will in part be to determine whether, in comparison with the guarantees given by the Charter, the investigation in this case “cast too wide net”.
[6] Accordingly, the Crown shall make timely disclosure of:
(a) The number of stops of out-of-province vehicles made by Constable Chornecki in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004;
(b) The reason for each stop in the first place;
(c) How many such stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics;
(g) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband, including narcotics;
[7] The parties will note that have not ordered that the names of the drivers stopped be disclosed and that have not ordered the actual notes of the officer to be reproduced.
The notes of course will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will need to be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold.","FIAT: The defence has indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial.
Defence now wants further disclosure of information that relate to those important issues.
HELD: Further disclosure is ordered.
The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.","[5, 0, 13, 14, 6, 7, 12, 8, 4]"
712,"[1] The Crown is appealing the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.
The Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge.
[2] The Crown’s case consisted of an Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit P-1) and the admission of the item seized from the accused on July 18, 2009, sword in black plastic sheath (Exhibit P-2).
[3] On the morning of July 18, 1009, the accused and Dr. Nick Perry were at the Sarcan Recycling Centre at 1601 Angus Street in Regina.
Dr. Perry was standing behind the accused.
The switch-blade have described affords useful contrast: there is no apparent normal, peaceful use to be served by the device that can arm the closed instrument in flash; the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the device is to enable person who is looking for or expects fight to carry the closed knife concealed or partly concealed in one hand and, by the application of pressure to the button by the same hand, to have instanter in that hand knife with the blade pointing forward from the handle.
[20] In this case the trial judge found that the sword had a blunt edge.
There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon.
The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants.
At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon.
The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence.
HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience.
No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge.
The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store.
On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon.
The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed.
The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon.
The Crown appeal was dismissed.","[2, 108, 0, 3, 5, 4, 114, 107]"

I. Introduction
[1] Kareem Almajidi was charged with sexually assaulting D.K. contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her, using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code.
Mr. Almajidi testified on his own behalf.
He said he did not know that she was prostitute and, if he had known, he never would have permitted her to enter his home.
When this part of the episode came to an end, she tried to make her escape, at which point she stated he struck her on the back three times with baseball bat.
The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence\'s unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal.
The probation and all other orders made by the trial judge remain in effect.

[12]2008 BCCA (CanLII).","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon.
He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation.
He appeals both conviction and sentence.
The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment.
The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex.
The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'.
Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face.
As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat.
The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies.
HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed.
The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court.
While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case.
There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial.
Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence.
The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case.
Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted.
The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels.
Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment.
After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada.
If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order.
The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","[1, 0, 148, 147, 153, 151, 13, 149, 146, 141, 7, 2, 150, 8, 140, 27, 134, 24]"

the enclosures included in items #7 and 10, for which the
claim for privilege was abandoned, are to be made available
for inspection or examination by the Department in accordance","An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure.
The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors.
The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions.
The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm.
At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties.
HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld.
2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction.
One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.
 3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.
The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor.
Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency.
7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery.
They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants.
8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice.
Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","[11, 12, 6, 718, 697, 701, 49, 48, 2, 698, 1, 20, 719, 30, 53, 721, 10, 28, 15, 720, 21, 722]"
715,"CORAM: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda
The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff
THE COURT [1] In this action brought by the respondent/plaintiff on a hail insurance contract for the 1996 crop year, the appellant, McQueen Agencies Ltd., appeals from an order entered in Queen’s Bench on October 15, 1998.
The respondent/plaintiff has no defence to the appellant’s counterclaim for premiums payable under the hail insurance contract.
[4] In the circumstances, we must treat the counterclaim as an independent action.
However, there are number of “housekeeping” items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the action.
The pleadings must be put in order.
With that in mind, we grant the appellant leave to amend its statement of defence to the plaintiff’s claim by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, together with any additional material facts pertaining to that defence.
[8] In giving these directions we are not to be taken as passing on the admissibility of evidence or other legal issues pertaining to the matters raised in the amended pleadings.
Since such matters are for the trial judge, it would be premature for this court to make any further comment.
[2] See appeal book page 90a","The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract.
The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off.
HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585.
1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim.
The plaintiff was granted leave to reply.
Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery.
2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action.
The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","[2, 0, 22, 25, 21, 8, 17, 3, 16, 15, 10]"
716,"[1] On June 5, 2009, this Court, in a written judgment (the “Judgment”) found the accused guilty of the following offence:COUNT 1 THAT HE, the said S. C. [sic], on or between the 20th day of May and the 22nd of December, A. D. 2005 at Muscowpetung First Nation, Saskatchewan did for a sexual purpose touch A. M. [sic] a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body, to wit: his hand, contrary to Section 151(a) of the Criminal Code.

(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years and to minium punishment of imprisonment for term of forty-five days; ...
Briefly stated, the accused was found guilty of directly touching, for sexual purpose with his hand, the vagina of A.M. on more than one occasion between May 20 and December 22, 2005.
3. That S.C. shall refrain from having any contact with A.M. during the period of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order.","The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A. M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code.
After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.
The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.
HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration.
Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon.
The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis.
There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act.
The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","[3, 4, 7, 136, 1]"

If Party (denoted in this Article XIV as the ""Vendor"") shall wish to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest in the Program Lands or Project Area (herein called the ""Offered Interest"") (the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest) at any time during the currency of this Agreement, the other Parties hereto then having Participating Interest in the Program Lands or Project Area affected (hereafter in this Section 14.01 called the ""Purchasers"") shall be entitled to right of refusal in respect thereof as follows:
(a) the Vendor shall first obtain from third party or third parties, which may include another Party to this Agreement, (herein collectively called the “Third Party”) an irrevocable offer to purchase the Offered Interest for cash, subject to the rights of the Purchasers pursuant to this Article (herein called the “Third Party Offer”);
The respondents Cameco and UEM preferred the Kensington plan and were prepared to commit themselves to it.
The voting agreement secured the follow up steps under the original commitment by Kensington which would be implemented over lengthy period.
We conclude that the voting agreement does not constitute sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant.
[7] The appeal is dismissed with costs to be taxed.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement.
They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause.
It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'.
HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.
The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement.
However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal.
In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets.
Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.
Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","[27, 29, 0, 26, 24, 3, 7, 8, 9]"
718,"[1] The accused is charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
This is the second case that have heard this year that involves gross intoxication on the part of not only the accused but the complainant as well.
Obviously if the witness is lying, his or her evidence is false and is of no value.
Whether the accused had lost consciousness by the time he assaulted the other, or whether his acts in assaulting the other were involuntary acts, are of no consequence insofar as the issue of criminal liability is concerned.
In my view, the court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.
These last two cases dealt only with automatism that did not arise from self-induced intoxication but they define the states and different kinds of automatism.
[39] In my view, the case before me is one of those rare cases in which the accused has established the Daviault “extreme intoxication” defence on balance of probabilities.
Were it not for s. 33.1 that does away with this defence in sexual assault cases, I would have acquitted him.
invite sentencing submissions from counsel.","The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code.
Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication.
Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent.
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
 1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities.
He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.
 2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent.
The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent.
The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief.
It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out.
She was incapable of giving consent after that time.
Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence.
It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality.
His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others.
The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society.
Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society.
The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness.
Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.
The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","[3, 1, 187, 194, 181, 193, 197, 195, 10]"
719,"He and his companion had much to drink that day and Mr. Drysdale was intoxicated.
He had verbal confrontation with Simon Brown, security officer providing loss protection services to the 7-Eleven.
Mr. Drysdale left the scene, went to the rear of the 7-Eleven building and, in an alleyway, went into yard and threw away the knife.
Police attended, arrested and charged him with the offence that he faced at his trial.
[3] This case rests primarily upon its facts.
[4] Cst. Lerat testified that he was uniformed officer on patrol the early evening of August 7, 2014.
[35] Mr. Hedstrom testified Mr. Brown said words to the effect “Get the fuck out of my face or I’ll knock you out”.
There was no history between these individuals as contemplated by ss. 34(2)(f), (f.1) nor does ss. 34(2)(h) apply.
Nor was it reasonable for Mr. Drysdale to believe that there was a threat of use of force made against him warranting the measures that Mr. Drysdale took.
[42] The accused testified but, as pointed out, where his evidence is at odds with that of the Crown’s witnesses, it is on peripheral matters only.
In the result, I find the accused guilty as charged.","Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence
The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code.
The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation.
The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife.
The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle.
The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused.
A knife was also located in the yard.
A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court.
The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers.
The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident.
He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to.
He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out.
The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them.
He said that he did not intend to stab them.
At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not.
The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle.
The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode.
The accused raised the issue of self-defence.
HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him.
The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires.
The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect.
The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused.
The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer.
The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat.
The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence.
The accused was found guilty as charged.","[195, 188, 189, 184, 3, 7, 4, 168, 8, 12, 17]"
720,"[1] The applicant defendant, New York Taxi Co. Ltd., seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. A‑32, setting aside the plaintiff’s pre‑judgment garnishees in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant’s bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005.
[4] As stated by Baynton J. in Rolls‑Royce Canada Ltd. v. La Ronge Aviation Services Ltd. (1996), 1996 CanLII 7112 (SK QB), 143 Sask. R. 296 at para. (Q.B.):
[3] It is trite law that plaintiff has statutory right to garnishee the defendant’s funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for debt or liquidated demand.
But pre‑judgment garnishment is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the Act goes to jurisdiction and renders the garnishee summons nullity.
On the first page of the invoice balance forward as at December 31, 2003, of $16,990.44 is indicated.
[14] The Plaintiff has accordingly not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.
2. The applicant shall be entitled to costs of this application which the Court fixes at $500.00, payable within 30 days of this fiat.","FIAT: The applicant defendant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishees in which $2,291.90 was paid into court from the defendant's bank account in December 2005.
The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act.
HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.
 1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons.
2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand.
Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement.
3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant.

These are the reasons.
[2] The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.
[5] On January 13, 2006, Family Court Judge made an order compelling the father to return the child to the mother pending the hearing as to interim custody, as the father had not done so at the end of the holiday.
In retrospect one is left to wonder why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her.
The information in the documents indicates that she would have been likely to co-operate.
[20] But even if the hearsay were admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either alcoholism or lack of proper care for the child, there should have been an order directing trial of an issue rather than decision made on the written evidence filed: Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 1996 CanLII 4930 (SK CA), 137 Sask. R. 295 (C.A.).
[21] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order below is set aside.
The father shall have leave to reapply on proper evidence if so advised.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.
During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
 1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision.
2) The appeal must succeed.
Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree.
The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case.
It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3)
It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case.
The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall.
One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her.
4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered.
The report were not sworn or verified under oath.
 Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered.
Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","[68, 67, 0, 6, 15, 5, 59, 66, 58]"

By the Court:
Corollary Relief Judgment was issued on this same date.
His application alleged that Lavada Crewe refused to provide access and communication with the children.
Ms. Crewe responded to that application and filed her response on September 10, 2006.
In addition Mr. Crewe and Mitchell had an argument that also resulted in the boys’ decision not to visit their father.
4. When the children are to be in vehicle driven by Mr. Crewe, he shall only drive within the confines of the Halifax Regional Municipality.
8. Thomas Crewe shall not use marijuana for medicinal or any purpose for at least an hour period prior to time when he intends to transport his children in his vehicle.
9. Thomas Crewe and Lavada Crewe shall have the right to remove the children from the Province of Nova Scotia and from Canada for the purpose of vacationing and the children’s passports shall be made available to the vacationing parent for this purpose.
Each parent shall inform the other of departure and return dates and provide an itinerary with contact telephone number or an address for the children.
If Mr. Crewe’s consent is required he shall provide that consent and sign any required documents for that purpose.","The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under.
She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation.
The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed.
The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence.
His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use.
An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana.
The unrepresented mother sought costs.
Conditions continued; variation granted.
If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation.
Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800.
In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children.
The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips.
While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother.
If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home.
In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party.
Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work.
She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","[7, 266, 276, 274, 278, 0, 275, 15, 2, 4, 8]"
726,"Location: Saskatoon
Appearing: Sandeep Bains For the Crown
Allen McGuire For the Accused
Prior to his trial, the accused, through his counsel, gave notice that he would be making an application to the court for ruling that the accused’s rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, (hereinafter referred to Charter), had been infringed, and seeking remedy for that infringement.
The Crown called three witnesses on the voir dire, those being Constable Epp, Sergeant Huisman, and Sergeant Johnson, all of the Saskatoon Police Service.
The two officers entered the building, and were directed to apartment 4.
Both the accused and Mr. McKay were in the apartment.
The police, for their own reasons, intended to stop short of arresting him and no ""words of arrest"" were spoken.
No force was used.
However, the issue, for purposes of s. of the Charter (""arbitrary detention""), was defined by the Court as what the person arrested understood.
There was, in the words of Lamer C.J., de facto arrest (para. 25).
[36] The explanation for the apparent contradiction is, in my opinion, that, in Latimer, the court found that there was an actual, legal arrest at the commencement, not an actual investigative detention which was transformed into an arrest.
The accused has not established that he was the subject of “unreasonable search or seizure” resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused is charged with aggravated assault.
A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached.
HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights.
1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel.
The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead.
When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'.
The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel.
There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.
 2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest.
It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'.
It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused.
The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release.
The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station.
The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest.
3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'.
The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","[177, 172, 169, 14, 5, 167, 22, 1, 19, 4, 166, 165, 8]"

During the peak season, the plaintiffs say they can experience approximately 10 to 15 balls day entering their yard.

am not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem.","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course.
The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property.
HELD: 1)
The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance.
It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property.
Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property.
In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward.
There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.
 2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties.
The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude.
3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year.
4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years.
The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","[4, 86, 8, 5, 78, 85, 81]"

Reasons By: The Honourable Madam Justice Gerwing
GERWING J.A. (orally)
[1 land owner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the Board of Revision of the City of Regina (the “Board”) alleging it to be too high.
[2 The Committee concluded that the Board had erred, having no jurisdiction, as the matter had unfolded, to make an increase, and it restored the original value.
[3 Leave to appeal was granted with respect to the following three questions:
(3) If not, then did the Committee err in jurisdiction in failing to have regard to and to apply s. 263.2 of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 to order an adjustment in the assessment to reflect the corrections?
[4 We are of the view that the answer to all three of these questions is no.
This it could not do.
While its procedure was flawed to some extent in that it did not specifically raise the vires issue so as permit the City to make argument on it, its conclusion in this respect was correct.
[5 Having given these answers, the appeal of the City, in essence, stands dismissed and the respondent taxpayer will have its costs in the ususal way on double Column V.","The landowner appealed an assessment for taxation purposes to the City Board of Revision alleging it was too high.
No cross-appeal was filed by the City but the Board increased the assessment.
The City then appealed to the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Assessment Appeals Committee to ask for a further increase.

The Committee concluded the Board erred, having no jurisdiction to make an increase, and restored the original value.
Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

731,"At the outset herein, the Crown entered stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
As well, he had claimed that his rights under ss. and of the Charter against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained had been breached.
Therefore, we proceeded on voir dire in respect to those matters and the evidence was applied to the trial proper.
Related to that issue, the Court must also determine whether the Crown has met any onus on it to establish that the accused had waived his rights to counsel.
As such, it was appropriate for the police to infer that his contact with Legal Aid duty counsel was satisfactory and he was waiving further consultation with some other lawyer.
In that same vein, the accused was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.
[38] In light of the accused having failed to establish that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been breached, there will be no consideration of potential remedy under s. 24 of the Charter.
The application herein by the accused is dismissed and we will need to reconvene court to determine whether the trial needs to continue on any other outstanding issue.","The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it.
The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention.
The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams.
The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel.
HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed.
The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated.
The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.

[4] This incident involves motor vehicle collision.
[5] The Sunfire was south bound on Circle Dr., as was the Accused’ vehicle.
She looked in her rear view mirror and saw head lights coming very quickly directly behind her and then her vehicle was hit.

S.J. No. 735 (Q.B.), Justice Dawson sat on an appeal from decision in which mistrial and an order for new trial was granted.
After Defence Counsel came upon this conversation, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and an opportunity for Counsel to prepare in light of the development.
The Officers had not testified and they were vigorously and effectively cross examined by Defence Counsel on the adjourned date.
stay is to be entered in the clearest of cases and when no other remedy will do.","Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified.
The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light.
The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m.
After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication.
The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m.
The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m.
The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan.
The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m.
At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample.
HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant.
The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified.
The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code.
The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident.
On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.
The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial.
When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness.
This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony.
The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered.
The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice.
Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.
The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges.
There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion.
Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate.
After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development.
stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases.
Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence.
The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","[4, 237, 236, 29, 11, 27, 221, 238, 17, 13, 5]"

A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB).
Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence.
The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence.
The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB.
_____
HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed.
The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges.
1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven.
The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision.
The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised.
Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion.
Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues:
The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case.
It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice.
This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee.
The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation.
It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature.
The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'.
To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice.
The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance.
If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue.
There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented.
3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence.
The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data.
The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects.
He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours.
4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76.
The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.
 5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","[1323, 1332, 1324, 1331, 21, 22, 1314, 1328, 1327, 70, 35, 18, 1310, 96, 1292, 32, 1309, 46, 6, 95, 68, 1289, 15]"

735,"[1] On October 4, 1982, Mildred Little made will naming her only son, the appellant James Little, executor.
The appellant gave no consideration for these transfers and the designation.
[3] When Ms. Little died on August 12, 1999, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of Ms. Little’s grandchildren, great-grandchildren and himself, and he in fact paid about $45,000 to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren, but nothing of those funds to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries named in the will.
The sisters brought action against the appellant claiming that the funds were a part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect as well a judgment against the appellant for the amounts they, as the residuary beneficiaries, should have received.
The appellant cannot succeed on this point.
The other side of the coin is that the trial judge did not accept his evidence that Ms. Little intended that the funds in question benefit the grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
[24] The appeal is dismissed with costs under Double Column V in the usual way.
RICHARDS J.A.","The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor.
In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents.
The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly.
She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000.
After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself.
He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will.
The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him.
He appeals against that judgment.
HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.
 1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2)
The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust.
The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren.
She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact.
Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate.
In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust.
In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis.
Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate.
3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF.
The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error.
The judge made no such error.
 4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren.
The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased.
The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him.
The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee.
The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","[4, 131, 139, 136, 10, 11, 124, 8]"

62. The judge also set out some very clear statements of what he understood to be the ethical obligations of lawyers who come into the possession of material for which privilege is claimed: see paras.
It is, in my view, essential that the Commission take serious and immediate steps to come to grips with the obvious issues which have arisen in the course of the investigation which it has ordered.","The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation.
He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege.
In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery.
The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made.
Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside.
The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.
The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","[202, 192, 20, 18, 6, 11, 4, 197, 188, 21]"

Dismissing the action with costs,
that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier.
With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work.
As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff.
Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","[0, 1, 98, 97, 19, 2, 23, 20, 105, 11, 93]"

The applicant was convicted in July of 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him.
In consequence he was sentenced to five years in prison.
He then appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against his sentence.
Others are less so, perhaps—and here have in mind the two or three grounds upon which counsel for the applicant relied most heavily, including the issue concerning corroboration-but, even then, they do not cut to all of the convictions, but only some, nor to the entirety of the sentence.
On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section.
Turning to the public interest, I think the present release of the applicant would be inimical to the public interest, having regard for the whole of the circumstances.

The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","[16, 18, 164, 10, 13, 160, 166, 150, 147, 4]"

This action was appealed and in Attorney General of Nova Scotia representing Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Nova Scotia and the Director of Assessment v. Frank Arnold Maclnnes, Myles Curtis Maclnnes and J.P. Maclnnes Trucking Limited and the Municipality of the County of Inverness, (1995), 1995 CanLII 4222 (NS CA), 141 N.S.R. (2d) 212, Chipman, J.A. delivering the Courts' decision, allowed certain of the amounts claimed, essentially legitimate cost items relating to the sale amounting to $7,522.95, but overturned the trial judge on the claim for legal costs incurred at the first trial, which by the time of the appeal were set forth as $39,385.82.
The grounds for the reversal was that this item of damage was too remote, not foreseeable, because, indeed it was not reasonable for that first action to have been embarked upon when the true state of affairs could be discovered upon reasonable investigation.
Those claims are as follows:
Rental Income Lost: 10,200.00
cannot help but comment that this case should not ever have gone to court with the type and quantity of damages claimed.
The situation here is not one to which the doctrine of contributory negligence would apply.
The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs in accordance with Tariff A, Scale 3, at an amount involved rounded out to $15,000.00.","The defendant municipality sold property owned by the plaintiffs at a tax sale.
Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the purchaser, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking a declaration as to the validity of the tax deed.
The deed was held to be valid at trial, but the tax sale was found to be void on appeal.
The plaintiffs sought to recover their legal fees from the municipality and the Attorney General together with some other items of loss and general damages.

that there is no evidence to warrant an award for general damages.

745,"On Appeal From: Q.B. 993 of 1996, J.C. of Saskatoon
Appeal File: 2484
Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Wakeling
The order in question was made pursuant to s. 234 of The Business Corporations Act, S.S. 1979, c. B-10, as a result of a finding by the chambers judge that the conduct of the Board of Directors of Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. had been high-handed and oppressive entitling the Rosetown and District Community Bond Corporation to relief.
The relief that was provided may well have been entirely appropriate, but it could have the effect of removing control of the said Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. from Loren Katzenberger and Sheryl Katzenberger who are its present and long-time majority shareholders.
This change of control could well occur as early as July 22nd, when a meeting of the shareholders is scheduled to be held at which time the voting rights of the shareholders will be changed as a result of the order of Kyle J. which is under appeal.
In the result, the application to lift the stay is dismissed with costs to follow the result of the appeal.

747,"By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Richards
I. Introduction
[1] The appellant, Taryn Rathgeber, was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.
He contended the information was nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty.
We dismissed his appeal with oral reasons following argument.
[2] On November 26, 2008 Mr. Rathgeber was charged with four offences on information 24292894.
The latter count specified that he was disqualified “by reason of an order pursuant to ss. 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.”
Charge No. did operate motor vehicle while disqualified from doing so by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code contrary to Section 259(4) of the Criminal Code.
This was not enough to give rise to reasonable apprehension of bias.
Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused’s criminal record does not automatically disqualify judge from presiding at trial.
No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge’s decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.
This matter is remitted to the trial judge in order that the case can be concluded.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.
He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty.
The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings.
That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court.
At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity.
He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.'
The trial judge dismissed the application to quash.
He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways:
The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.'
Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed.
The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record.
The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench.
In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety.
Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count.
More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction.
This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
The test for apprehension of bias is well settled.
The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.).
The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude.
It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories.
The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making.
Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.
No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","[78, 0, 6, 76, 5, 4, 7, 10, 13, 11, 73, 70, 18]"

(C) The Wife obtains employment.
23. The Husband’s employment pension with the U.N. accumulated from the date of marriage to the date of separation (September 4, 1982 to and including October 21, 2002) shall be divided equally between the parties at source.
Either party shall be at liberty to apply to Court of competent jurisdiction for an Order for further direction should difficulties occur with respect to the interpretation or implementation of the pension division set out in this paragraph.
Shortly after the Corollary Relief Judgment issued Consent Variation Order dated September 23, 2004, was agreed to.
2. Paragraph of the Corollary Relief Judgment shall also apply to April Luke “in the same manner as it was for William”.
3. decision with respect to William Luke’s status as “child of the marriage” is deferred.
Pending decision on that issue, David Luke shall pay to William Luke, as contribution to his post-secondary education 50% of the 1/3 of the table amount of child support payable pursuant to this Order.
The appropriate adjustment to the payment to both William Luke and Rosamond Luke shall be made according to the terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment for January, 2007.","The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively.
The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support.
The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment.
The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed.
Both parties applied to vary child support.
The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school.
Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses.
The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies.
The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months.
Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years.
The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","[591, 590, 7, 577, 589, 576, 578, 26, 593]"

By the Court:
[1] This proceeding concerns Eleri Bourque-Lemire, born November 29, 1994, and Aiden Bourque-Lemire, born May 4, 1997.
Ms. Bourque and Mr. Lemire married on October 2, 1993 and separated in or around May 5, 2002.
[2] On November 27, 2003 contested interim application was held before Justice Dellapinna of this Court.
IT IS ORDERED THAT pending further order of this Court:
a. The parties shall share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence shall be with the Applicant, Stephanie Bourque;
b. The Respondent, Christopher Lemire, shall have access with the children as follows:
I. Every Tuesday and Wednesday from after school until between 9:00 to 8:1;5; p.m. each day and
ii. Every second weekend from Friday after school to between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. Sunday, beginning Friday December 5, 2003 and every second weekend thereafter.
[25] I conclude that it is not in the children’s best interests to remain in Ms. Bourque’s residential care beyond the end of the school year.
It would be my expectation that this Order would be brought current by no later than April 30, 2005.

The mother later unilaterally moved from Bridgewater to Halifax, frustrating the access provisions of the interim order.
The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody.
Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly.
The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","[7, 1, 0, 9, 154, 8, 5, 10, 4, 2, 11, 158, 136]"
750,"1. Was the plaintiff constructively dismissed as result of changes unilaterally made by the defendant in the terms of her employment?
4. Should the fact that during her period of employment with the defendant, the plaintiff was absent from her employment for ten months on so-called maternity leave be taken into account to reduce the notice period she would otherwise be entitled to?
She is presently unemployed and has been since her employment with the defendant ended.
She began employment with the defendant in May of 1991.
In addition she prepared applications for customers seeking credit with the defendant.
Unquestionably, it is not intended as an opportunity for the employee to be seeking new employment.
Here, however, am struck with the apparent difficulty that the plaintiff has had and will continue to have in finding employment at an equivalent rate of remuneration in the Truro area, as evidenced by her inability to date to find suitable employment despite diligent efforts on her part.
am satisfied that she has explored all possibilities for potential employment and has simply not been successful at any rat of pay.
She has turned down no positions because she has not had the option of doing so.
She simply has not been offered any positions.
Considering all of the circumstances, I have concluded that an appropriate and proper period of notice is eight months.
will hear counsel further as to the rate of prejudgment interest and costs of this proceeding.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal.
The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months.
During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff.
The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended.
She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause.
She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible.
The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice.
Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice,
that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice.
This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","[0, 3, 172, 171, 7, 176, 170, 6, 14, 157, 173, 165]"

Each will notify the other within 30 days in the event of any change in their employment status or sources of income.","The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her.
The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well.

The father works long hours as a maintenance man.
The mother has four other children from previous relationships.
The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home.
The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education.
One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care.
While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home.
The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort.
The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way.

752,"Counsel: Gary Holt, for the Crown
Nancy Rubin, for the Chronicle Herald
Counsel for The Chronicle Herald and the Daily News take the position that this is public proceeding to which they should have access.
This is evidenced by numerous provisions in the YCJA which speak to the participation of the parent:
am therefore of the view that the parent, the Minister/Department of Community Services can and should provide input into the question of whether or not the conference should be open to the public and the media.
(1) Is the Youth Justice Court convened conference, presently scheduled for December 11, 2006 part of the court process?
[8] The use of conferences, to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law, is statutorily authorized by the YCJA.
[74] The benefits of an exclusion order, obtaining vital information and recommendations needed to assist the court in arriving at a determination on sentencing, outweighs the deleterious effect of restricting the public’s right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
[75] This is one of those rare circumstances in which an exclusion order is necessary to prevent serious risk to the administration of justice and the benefits of the order outweigh its drawbacks.","A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference.
The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence.
Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present.
Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press.
Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media.
The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth.
There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","[313, 0, 8, 310, 3, 24, 17, 27, 23]"
753,"[1] The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child support and spousal support and further for all support arrears to be expunged.

There was no appeal taken from that order.
The matter did not proceed any further.

This breakdown was proposed by the counsel for the petitioner and accepted by counsel for the respondent.
5. Should there be an order of costs in this case?
[50] The respondent has been largely unsuccessful in his application to vary and expunge.
While he accepted his obligation to pay these amounts, it was only done after the petitioner pursued the issue in her responding materials.
In the event there is disagreement on the contents of the order, the parties have leave to have the matter placed before me by way of conference call to hear submissions.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005.
The court assumed that the imputation was correct.
The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012.
From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office.
The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them.
The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","[14, 15, 1, 5, 240, 248, 245, 242, 237, 13, 19, 232, 243]"

INITIALS: pw","Coachlight sought an order requiring the defendant to pay the balance of its 35% share of $681,955.58 as costs for drilling a petroleum/natural gas well plus $49,701.61 representing its 35% share of the lifting and production costs under the Operating Agreement.
The plaintiff also sought a declaration that it holds builders' liens against the defendant's interest in the Well and other joint interest assets to the extent of the debts due.
Duce Oil denies liability for any costs of the horizontal well in excess of $447,535 being 110% of the authorization for expenditure executed with respect to the Well.
The defendant counterclaimed on the basis the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent in conducting operations and overcharged or made improper charges in its accounting procedures.
HELD: 1)Duce was liable for $96,286.95 representing 35% of the unpaid costs of the original and supplemental authorization for expenditures (AFE) and the costs of the screw pump.
2)Duce was responsible for $49,701.61 representing regular lifting and production costs and other joint interest wells plus expenditures under $25,000 which did not require an AFE.
3)Coachlight was only entitled to interest from the time of its written notice on June 20/94 that it was exercising its option under the CAPL 1981 to charge interest.
4)In default of payment within 90 days of Judgment the plaintiff would be entitled to a builders' lien in the entire estate or interest of the defendant in all petroleum, natural gas and other hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, upon or under the lands as specified together with all proceeds from the defendant's interests in petroleum and natural gas and its interest in fixtures, machinery, tools, appliances and other property in any of the defendant's oil or gas wells on those lands.
5)The totality of the evidence did not support the portrayal by the defendant of the plaintiff as a high handed, arrogant operator who simply forgot it had a minority partner.
 6)The plaintiff was entitled to its taxable costs.","[4, 8, 305, 308, 11, 312, 25, 3, 26, 314, 17]"

Mark Persick For the Plaintiff
JUDGMENT R. GREEN,
[19] The plaintiff submits, in pointing to what they characterized as inconsistencies in the printout, that there was so-called glitch in Gardon Securities’ computer monitoring system that led to no alarm from Sturgis Meats being received by them on August 14, or the days leading up to that day.
The defendant says that the obvious cause of the fact that no alarm was received on or before August 14, 2010 is that the monitoring equipment of Sturgis Meats either failed perhaps from lack of proper maintenance or was adjusted improperly by someone at Sturgis Meats.
It is, however, equally possible that the reason no alarm was received by Gardon Securities was that none was generated at Sturgis Meats, either because of failure or glitch in the temperature monitoring equipment (which am satisfied belonged to and was the responsibility of Sturgis Meats) or because of the way that monitoring equipment was set or adjusted by someone other than an employee of Gardon Securities.
Put another way, there is not in my view proof to that standard that the reason Gardon Securities did not receive freezer temperature alarm from Sturgis Meat was within their control.
[26] This action is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business.
The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business.
The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off.
The defendant had received no alarm.
The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer.
HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring.
The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business.
The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received.
It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired.
The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract.
The action is dismissed.","[3, 92, 87, 5, 93, 94, 80, 2, 77]"
758,"1) The respondent is medical specialist who seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as result of his not paying child support for many years.
2) The petitioner is 63 years old, deeply in debt, on long term disability and still caring for one of their children who will likely never be independent because he suffers from serious mental illness.
The application
4) The petitioner originally hails from Zimbabwe and the respondent from Malawi.
The children stayed with the petitioner in Moose Jaw.
7) The first few years after the separation were marked by continual stream of vigorously contested applications over spousal and child support.
The respondent retained prominent Regina lawyer Dr. Morris Schumiacher.
The petitioner hired E.F.A. Merchant who was almost always successful, obtaining orders for both spousal and child support.
For an example of undue hardship, consider the petitioner’s plight.
She receives some money from Social Services to help defray the costs of Thabani’s care but she has so much debt to service that she cannot put money away for Thabani’s care after she passes.
That is undue hardship.
It is repugnant to even suggest reducing the arrears.
43) order as follows:
5. Commencing June 1, 2013 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order of the Court, the respondent shall pay basic child support in the amount of $927 per month.","The parties had three children during their marriage.
After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000.
The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it.
She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support.
The parties were regularly in court.
In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic.
His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001.
In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001.
He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage.
His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years.
The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia.
HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively.
With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage.
The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000.
Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300.
The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000.
The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears.
The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001.
The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears.
The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","[223, 14, 3, 8, 224, 220, 4, 0, 229, 20, 21, 23, 209, 219]"

[1] This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of filing a bond.
27(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the property guardian shall give security in any amount that the court may direct and with those sureties that the judge may approve, for:
(a) duly accounting once in every year, or more often if required by the court; and
(b) filing the inventory required pursuant to section 26.
Mrs. Sotnikow’s will divides her estate equally amongst her six children, and the four children who are not applicants consent to the application without a necessity of a bond.
[11] On the foregoing facts, am not able to conclude this is an appropriate case to dispense with bond.
Almost every application would so qualify, because in most cases the nearest relatives always consent.
[12] The application to be appointed personal decision-makers is in order, and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted.
Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's.
Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond.
This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001.
Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc.
The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000.
Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate.
HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted.
No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship.
The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4).
Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment.
The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate.
Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not.
To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","[65, 67, 2, 6, 3, 64, 61, 8, 7, 60]"
760,"THE COURT: Application to adduce fresh evidence on hearing of appeal dismissed per reasons for ruling of Hallett, J.A.;
This application to adduce evidence on appeal arises on an appeal from an order of the Family Court dismissing the appellant\'s application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son who had been taken into care by the Children\'s Aid Society shortly after his birth.
The request that this court receive evidence on the appeal is made pursuant to s. 49(5) of the Children and Family Services Act, R.S.N.S. 1990, Chapter and Civil Procedure Rule 62.22 which is the general rule governing the reception of evidence on the hearing of an appeal.
Civil Procedure Rule 62.22 provides:
A62.22(1) The Court on application of party may on special grounds authorize evidence to to be given to the Court on the hearing of an appeal on any question of fact as it directs.
(3) The Court on an appeal may on special grounds inspect or view any place, property or thing.""
The principles for the reception of fresh evidence were stated by McIntyre J. in R. v. Palmer at p. 775:
Concurred in:
No. 02910 NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL
and CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF HALIFAX","The applicant sought to adduce fresh evidence on an appeal of a Family Court order which dismissed her application to terminate a permanent custody order respecting her son.

that the evidence sought to be admitted was either available at trial and was not adduced, was repetitious of evidence given at trial, or was evidence which could not be expected to affect the decision.","[0, 2, 6, 9, 7, 29, 3, 30, 28, 13]"
761,"Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant.
The police were contacted and charge laid was against the appellant of uttering threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
[2] The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial on May 14, 2008 in Provincial Court.
Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge.
[96] What the appellant actually said to Van Bommel on October 25, 2007 was crucial conversation.
It was relied upon by the trial judge to justify the inferences he drew about what the appellant’s intention was.
The Crown at trial advocated that such reasonable person was Professor Van Bommel himself.
The evidence wrongly admitted put the appellant in bad light.
The normal remedy under s. 686(2) for such errors would be to quash the conviction and order new trial.
[101] In light of my conclusion need not consider the sentence appeal.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment.
The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.'
Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student.
The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them.
He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor.
Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.
The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility.
The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","[611, 624, 630, 8, 7, 11, 610, 9, 627, 615]"

By the Court:
[1] Application to strike pleadings and for summary judgment granted in Chambers February 15, 2005 upon the court concluding that mere intentions, negotiations, etc., and pleadings of a cause of action failed to create a cause of action.
[3] The originating notice action in this matter was filed July 21, 2003 and therefore the new tariff of September 29, 2004 does not apply, (Little v. Chignecto Central Regional School Board (2004), 2004 NSSC 265 (CanLII), 230 N.S.R. (2d)1).
[4] There is no tariff that provides direction with respect to the determination of the amount of costs in Chambers’ applications.
While time sheets, etc., can be very helpful in determining party and party costs, the level of solicitors’ fees in this application is not very helpful in measuring an amount that is just and appropriate.
[5] The hearing in this matter was less than two hours in duration, however, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application including filing a list of documents, exchange of documents and apparently two days of discovery.
[6] In the circumstances, I think a reasonable and fit party and party level of costs is $5,000 plus disbursements of $510.97 and the defendant is entitled to judgment for costs and disbursements herein taxed and allowed in the amount of $5,510.97.","The court granted the defendant's application for summary judgment of claim.

763,"1. This is a charge of failing to yield, contrary to Section 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act:
Before he got through to the turn he saw another on-coming vehicle, this one 1987 Ford Tempo driven by Adrianna Wormworth.
He says that he saw this vehicle for only few seconds before the collision.
3. Since the defendant turned across the path of the Ford Tempo, and since the two vehicles came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do by Section 50(3).
“The fact that the defendant had the right of way did not give him an absolute right, nor did it relieve him from compliance with his common law and statutory duty to drive with due care in the circumstances.
Drivers of vehicles cannot be required to regulate their driving as if in constant fear that other drivers who are under observation, and apparently acting reasonably and properly, may possibly act at critical moment in disregard of the safety of themselves and other users of the road.
I find as a fact that when the defendant commenced his turn, any vehicle lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.
14. I find the defendant not guilty.
H.W. Goliath, Provincial Court Judge","A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act.
The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second.
Two passengers were knocked unconscious.
One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head.
HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.
His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances.
The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield.
The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision.
It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.
 1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3).
The right of way, however, is not absolute.
As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor.
It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on.
Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor.
Alcohol was not a factor.
Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights.
3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","[0, 55, 4, 51, 56, 58, 6, 5, 9]"
764,"The grounds put forward for the application may be summarized as:
(1) The Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilcox school community council, and it is alleged the election is nullity.
[2] Section 87(1)(x) of the Act grants the power to board of education to close schools upon compliance with the requirements thereafter set out in the section.
(x) with respect to any school situated in school district:
(a) commencing at the end of the day determined by the board of education, pursuant to section 163, as the last school day in one school year; and
(b) ending on the day prior to the day determined by the board of education, pursuant to section 163, as the first school day in the school year following the school year mentioned in clause (a).
[40] With respect to the criteria of irreparable harm, the harm alleged by the applicants is largely qualitative and subjective one.
The applicants are concerned that their children will suffer reduction in the quality of their life by reason of having to spend approximately 40-50 minutes day on the bus, as opposed to walking back and forth to school, and they will not be able to come home for lunch.
They allege there will be less opportunity for their children to enjoy extracurricular activities both in Wilcox because the school will be closed, and at Milestone because they will have to be available to take the bus ride home.","FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school.
They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed.
HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case.
1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case.
The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity.
There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council.
There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided.
No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election.
The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding.
The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made.
To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process.
2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair.
A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","[6, 2, 19, 9, 20, 1, 243, 241, 242]"

Unlike Vollman (supra), counsel has not acknowledged receipt of the notice, nor was there any inquiry as to whether he was prepared to admit receiving such notice.
Counsel for the Crown asserted in argument that defence counsel was provided notice in the usual way and noted that counsel for the accused is not denying that it was received.
However, without any such proof, the Court cannot be satisfied that the notice requirement has been fulfilled.
Without compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate is not admissible in evidence.
This would be admissible pursuant to s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act provided notice has been given in accordance with s. 30(7) of the Act.
Again, there is no proof that such notice was given.
[26] Accordingly, the Crown has failed to establish that the accused was disqualified or prohibited from driving and therefore, the accused is found not guilty.","The Crown found the accused not guilty.
With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address.
The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary.
Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth.
That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice.
Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present.
All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity.
Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice.
However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel.
Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence.
There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","[118, 114, 112, 108, 111, 115, 3, 2, 106, 5, 107, 4, 1, 96]"
770,"[1] This is an application for judicial review of decision of The Workers’ Compensation Board (the “Board”) denying the applicant reimbursement for the cost of the applicant’s medical marihuana.
[3] The applicant has been prescribed numerous medications for pain over the years with varying degrees of success.
In 2002, on the recommendation of his physician, he commenced using medical marihuana.
4. Did the Board’s decision to deny reimbursement to Mr. Heilman meet the appropriate standard of review?
5. Was the Board’s decision made for an improper purpose?
According to the applicant, the Board denied reimbursement because medical marihuana is socially contentious.
[40] The Board refused reimbursement on the basis that medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and its positive effects are clinically unproven.
If the Board has authority to refuse reimbursement for such reasons, there is no improper purpose.
[41] The applicant also asserts that the Board based its decision on irrelevant considerations, in effect, misconceived perception of the potential political ramification of paying for medical marihuana.
[42] Again, there is no evidence that the Board made its decision on the basis of considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marihuana.
On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and unproven.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it.
It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable.
The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective.
In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex;
and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","[146, 147, 0, 143, 145, 142, 3, 141, 138, 4, 15]"
771,"The objections to questions or production of documents taken at the examinations for discovery fall under the broad categories of relevance, and privilege.
Background [2] The action arises out of a helicopter crash which occurred in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on October 4, 1995 which resulted in the death of three crew members and 12 passengers.
[3] The nine plaintiffs are the legal representatives of deceased passengers who were employed by some of the named corporate defendants who were involved in the construction of gold mine in Kyrgyzstan.
They also allege the defendants knew it was unsafe (paragraph 13 of the statement of claim).
[51] Defendants’ counsel’s request pursuant to Rule 142 to obtain from the plaintiffs particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim including particulars of the sections allegedly breached, is proper.
The names of persons who have provided facts or observations prior to the accident to counsel for the plaintiffs’ relevant to the issues are to be disclosed in the same circumstances outlined with respect to the order in favour of the plaintiffs.
Apart from the issue of whether such character evidence would be admissible at trial, the question as framed is improper.","FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery.
Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege.
The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor.
HELD: 1)Relevancy.
The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence.
Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant.
Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous.
Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not.
Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial.
Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable.
Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced.
Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked.
The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant.
Leave was granted to reapply for direction.
2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed.
The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged.
(b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted.
The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed.
The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda.
(c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable.
The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident.
While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable.
A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants.
(d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial.
Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference.
(e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged.
It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident.
(f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement.
The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer.
Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview.
(g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation.
3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees.
The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed.
Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues.
4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days.
5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed.
The question was relevant only to character.
Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion.
6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","[242, 3, 5, 2, 247, 253, 16]"

[2] The applicant continues to pay this spousal support which (except for the unilateral reduction in 1995) he has been paying for in excess of 25 years in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
The applicant also asserts that the respondent is now employed part-time and earns an income which was not the case at the time the agreement was entered into.

The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into.
The fact it has now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application.

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first.
The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years.
The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income.
In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement.
At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant.
HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established.
Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement.
It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income.
This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support.
The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement.
The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent.
The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","[4, 34, 0, 31, 30, 8, 25, 5]"

See also: Fridman, The Law of Contract 4th Ed. P. 610","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants.
The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.
HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service.
1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners.
This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned.
Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed.
Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant.
2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded.
This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took.
The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","[78, 80, 82, 6, 81, 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 75, 74, 10]"

(2) Where it appears that there has been failure on the part of party or his solicitor or, in the case of the Crown or body corporate, or an officer thereof, to make reasonable effort to give full discovery of all documents that relate to any matter in proceeding, the court may impose on the party, solicitor, or officer such terms or penalty as it thinks just.
This application was made before Skipper called evidence.
The basis of the application is that Skipper had failed to make reasonable effort to produce documents and information and to give full discovery relevant to the matters in issue.
The cause of action, according to the pleadings, first arose in 1985.
The action was commenced on June 27, 1986, and the pleadings appear to have closed in 1989.
The plaintiff retained the chartered accountants, Doane Raymond, to prepare report on the alleged loss occasioned to it by the defendants.
Mr. D'Eon was witness obviously allied to the plaintiff.
In any event, those questions and answers objected to would not have changed the result of this application.
am satisfied, however, that in order to reach an appropriate conclusion in this particular application, findings of fact and credibility were essential.
One will give the full effect of this decision which will be sealed with the decision.
As this is an application made prior to the commencement of the trial, do not consider myself seized with the matter.","The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information.

[3] In jury trial, the jury does not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction.
The sentencing judge is bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict.
The sentencing judge must not accept as fact any evidence inconsistent with verdict rejected by the jury.
[4] In the circumstances of this trial, both Calvin Klemenz and Thomas Matychuk were convicted of the offence as charged as principal and/or as party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence.
The jury verdict established that both Calvin Klemenz and Thomas Matychuk broke and entered F.J.’s home and participated as principal or party in the aggravated assault on F.J.
This implies that there must not be an unjustifiable disparity in sentences between sentences imposed for similar offences and similar offenders.
[144] Thomas Matychuk was arrested on this charge on July 17, 2012 so am prepared to give him credit of 19 months and two weeks.
I give Thomas Matychuk credit of 19 months and two weeks for the time spent in custody.","Criminal Law – Home Invasion – Sentencing
HELD: The Court sentenced Klemenz to 12 years imprisonment for breaking and entering and committing the offence of aggravated sexual assault.
He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody.
Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit.
Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months.
The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim.
The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time.
Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.","[4, 6, 1055, 15, 14, 3, 1057, 7, 31]"
781,"Occasionally, and usually when they had been drinking, the male tenants would get together in the basement to indulge in wrestling and horseplay.
The female tenants considered “the fight club” as strange bonding ritual something that the men did to rid themselves of their frustrations.
In any event, as the evening progressed and all present were in various stages of intoxication, the accused invited the complainant to go to the basement to participate in the fight club.
The complainant willingly accepted the invitation.
However, instead of wrestling hold, he advanced and struck the accused in the face.
Surprised and stunned, the accused put his arms around the complainant to prevent him from striking again, and, as result, they stumbled to the floor.
In brief struggle that followed, the accused ended on top of the complainant and commanded the situation.
Rather than speculate, think that the evidence was not only contradictory but also disturbing.
Absent the bodily harm this, in my view, was consensual fight.
This does not mean that the complainant did not suffer bodily harm.
It means, in my opinion, on the evidence before me and on the analysis that have made, that the Crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence as charged.
I find the accused, Craig Nickerson, not guilty, as charged, and will enter an acquittal on the record.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm.
The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him.
During the fight, the parties fell into a dresser, onto the floor and out a window.
At some stage of the fight, the complainant sustained a nasal fracture, which was the basis of the charge.
Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm.
The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.
However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant.
There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.","[177, 179, 175, 11, 178, 12, 4, 171, 13, 2, 9, 8]"

Registrar in Bankruptcy","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued.
He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants.
The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors.

Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention.
The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure.
Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial.

[1] This is an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000.
The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties which was effective on October 1, 1999 and expires on September 30, 2002.
[6] On February 8, 2000 Ms. MacMaster returned to work from her maternity leave maintaining, of course, her top spot on the departmental seniority list.
[34] The arbitrator briefly alluded to this at page 13-14 of her award when she posed the question:
The question to be asked is whether Article 9:01 can reasonably be given an interpretation that has the potential to detrimentally affect employees returning from maternity leave, depending on their standing of seniority.
This patent defect, and the arbitrator’s implicit finding that the hotel violated Article 9:01 of the collective agreement, is such that it warrants the intervention of the court on judicial review.
The applicant hotel is also entitled to its costs of the application which are hereby fixed in the amount of $1500 plus taxable disbursements.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave.
The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority.
The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority.
The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review.
Application allowed;
the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside.
The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision.
Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","[145, 152, 4, 150, 3, 0, 142, 15]"

INTRODUCTION
SENTENCE [63] On the aggravated assault (Information 44662780), it is my view that the appropriate sentence is a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation.
1. Keep the peace and be of good behaviour, and appear before the Youth Justice Court whenever required to do so by the Court;
5. Present yourself personally to any peace officer/youth worker checking on your curfew or residence;
9. Attend school, work or day program and not miss classes except with medical note from your doctor for illness;
10. Refrain from the use, possession or consumption of alcohol and non-prescribed (illicit) drugs;
14. Attend all psychiatrist appointments as directed and take all medication prescribed by your doctor or psychiatrist;
15. Not possess any weapons as defined by the Criminal Code or knives outside of your residence.
[65] On the offences of breach of undertaking (Information 44662781) and breach of youth sentence (Information 36654171), impose period of 12 months probation to be served concurrent to the probation order imposed on the aggravated assault and concurrent to each other.
[66] According to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, aggravated assault is primary designated offence and the provision of DNA sample is mandatory.
[67] Pursuant to s. 51(1) of the YCJA, impose mandatory weapons prohibition.","The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker.
The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle.
The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people.
One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head.
The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat.
The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head.
The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down.
After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley.
The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth.
He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work.
The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision.
At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age.
He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty.
His parents were separated.
He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence.
He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats.
He had served five open custody sentences.
HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence.
The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim.
The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors.
In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court.
The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation.
He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision.
The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused.
A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.
Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","[197, 201, 204, 188, 196, 192, 203, 206, 202, 6, 3, 185]"

JUDGMENT M.M. BANIAK,
Constable Vanthuyne entered the observation room.
According to his testimony, the accused told him that she had two shots that night.
[4] After the observation period, the accused was taken to the breathalyzer room.
The second test started at 7:35 a.m. and the second suitable sample was obtained at 7:38 a.m.
I believe the officers could have acted in a more expeditious manner.
[55] Secondly, the delay may have prejudiced the accused.
WWR 448: The purpose of s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code is to provide the Crown an evidentiary shortcut to proving impairment.
As such it protects against the manipulation or skewing of the results by delaying testing to allow for the absorption of alcohol into the accused’s blood.
[57] Having regard to all of the above, I find that the officer’s explanation for the delay was not satisfactory, and further, that the delay prejudiced the accused.
[59] The merits of count #1 in the Information were not argued, and, in any event, having regard to the finding in count #2, could not be proven.
[1] Kang-Brown, 2008 SCC 18 (CanLII); [2008]","HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice.
The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it;
and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained.
However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained.
The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately.
The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","[194, 196, 197, 191, 6, 16, 3, 193, 21, 187, 18, 185, 0, 4, 17]"
790,"By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Herauf
[1] The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
[4] There was testimony that Mr. Alves was travelling anywhere between 93 to 180 kilometers per hour.
Mr. Siba, witness who saw the accident, estimated that Mr. Alves’ car was travelling 160 kilometers per hour.
Mr. Matlock estimated that the car was travelling between 130 to 140 kilometres per hour, “but that it may have been faster.”
Mr. Alves testified and said he was driving between 90 to 100 kilometres per hour.
Mr. Chetty testified that he saw car swerve off the road to avoid Mr. Alves’ car.
Mr. Alves testified that he passed two vehicles prior to the accident; immediately after passing the second, he lost control and crashed.
[a] Crown appeal cannot be the means whereby the Crown puts forward different case than the one it chose to advance at trial.
At no time did Crown counsel suggest that defence counsel’s access to the documents required preliminary showing of materiality.
[w]ith respect to the weighing of evidence, the manner in which the jury assessed individual pieces of evidence was not question of law in respect of which the trial judge was required to instruct the jury.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.
The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal.
The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so.
The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony.
The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed.
The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous.
The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial.
The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial.
The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial.
Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","[16, 29, 20, 31, 15, 24, 356, 338, 0, 323, 5]"

[1] This appeal is taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. M-23.2.
[2] The appeal concerns the 1997 assessment, for municipal tax purposes, of shopping centre in Saskatoon called Market Mall.
This judgment must be read in conjunction with it.
The same may be said in respect of the committee declining to accept the appellant's argument that economic utility should govern, rather than the ability of the improvements to adequately perform the function for which they were used.
Finally, the committee was obviously of the view that the evidence showed that the improvements did adequately perform the function for which they were used which is another way of saying that there was no lack of economic utility.
[15] In sum, the decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual, but as a result of the appellant\'s failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.
Or, to put it another way, it was decided on the evidence or lack thereof.
[17] Since success was divided, there shall be no order as to costs.
concur. BAYDA C.J.S.","An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes.
In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city.
HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual.
Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal.
3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed.
Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision.
The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case.

[28] Judgment accordingly.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act.
The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation.
The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants.
HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions.
The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed.
1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation.
Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution.
The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs.
2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance.
A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances.

On January 6, 1998, Case Credit wrote Mr. Poirier demanding payment of $10,122.72 which, according to Case Credit, was comprised of $9,973.12 for ""principal"" and $149.60 for ""past due interest"".

must follow the principles enunciated in Société Generale (Canada) v. Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., 1995 ABCA 259 (CanLII), [1995]
[11] The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The defendant is awarded costs on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs.","The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer.
The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3.
1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment.
The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale.
Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party.
Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used.
The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law.
The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer.
He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours.
The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract.
The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment.
He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability.
Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent.
To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors.
Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55.
It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure.
5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause.
Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","[64, 63, 4, 3, 2, 61, 11, 0, 59, 12]"

Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.
Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement.
Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile.
The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.
Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","[0, 2, 105, 6, 3, 99, 106, 7, 9, 13, 12, 17, 93]"

In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant.
The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land.
The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages.
The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest.
The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000.
The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
 1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2)
The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property.
The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'.
Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect.

798,"[1] The applicants, who are charged separately with cultivating marihuana and possession of marihuana have plead not guilty to the charges.
As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside:
(1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones.
(3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges.
[2] number of grounds were advanced by defence counsel which will be dealt with more specifically hereinafter.
When permitted, the cross-examination should be limited by the trial judge to questions that are directed to establish that there was no basis upon which the authorization could have been granted.
Section 487(1) states search warrant should authorize peace officers or public officers only.
This coincidence does not trigger concern for the propriety of ongoing police investigations.
With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.
 They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.
The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization.
As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with.
The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry.
The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information.
HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed.
The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial.
The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside.
The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.
The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.
 2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence.
It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates.
4)The 1997 authorization was set aside.
The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter.
The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met.
There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed.
The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading.
The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch.
The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved.
Neither had a criminal record.
The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.
 5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization.
A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization.
The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant.
The privacy interest was comparatively high.
The nature of the constitutional breach was major.
The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis.
6)The residence search warrant was set aside.
The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge.
The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information.
The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable.
7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale.
There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met.
While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith.
On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.
 8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant.
The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter.
A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants.
The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras.
The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast.
The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along.
It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid.
The two events did not amount to a course of conduct.
9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","[3, 401, 5, 6, 29, 395, 2, 0, 377]"

First, whatever definition of “livestock” is used, the definition always includes cattle.
They are included, since cattle are “livestock” under any definition of the word.
Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in the district.

The mother sought sole custody with generous access.
The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication.
Allowing the mother's application,
that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say.
Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.
As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","[238, 1, 0, 2, 3, 235, 213, 232, 228, 223, 20, 224]"
804,"J. Plemel, Q.C. for the Crown
B.M. SINGER, PCJ DECISION June 27, 2007
[1] This is a decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer.
While continuing his investigation of the first incident, he attended at the parking lot of St. Paul’s Hospital in Saskatoon where he was approached by the accused.
The accused called out to him and said; “Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.”
[3] His interest piqued, the officer spoke with the accused and received identification information from his licence and advised him to check into the injuries he displayed by seeing the nurse at the emergency department.
accept that the accused responded to the police officer that he knew his rights and understood the warning.
In those circumstances it is not necessary to consider the seriousness of the violation or the repute of the administration of justice.
Therefore, all of the statements of the accused including those made after the arrest are excluded and will not form part of the Crown’s case.
[21] The result of the voir dire is that none of the statements of the accused will be admissible in evidence in this trial.","Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.'
The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers.
The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample.
The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood.
During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information.
The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions.
The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand.
The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police.
The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law.
HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case.
The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive.
The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights.
He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act.
He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute.
Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated.
Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements.
The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act.
As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial.
As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","[0, 68, 62, 2, 3, 8, 7, 59, 6, 69]"
805,"[1] Three motions have been brought.
[2] In the second motion the defendants, Wayne McGillivray and Michael Johnston, also seek to have the plaintiff\'s claim dismissed.
[4] The two applications of the defendants, insofar as they are based on Rule 188, are dismissed.
That rule provides for a determination of a point of law.
(1) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim is barred by a statutory limitation period.
(3) Whether a portion of the plaintiff\'s claim fails to disclose a cause of action against Quinney, Sullivan, Bauer, McGillivray and Johnston because there is no allegation of malice.
(4) Whether the plaintiff\'s claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan is barred by statute.
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;
It may be that this alleged conduct would not fall within s. 5(6) and no immunity may exist.
(1) that the applications by the several defendants to have this action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period are dismissed;
(4) that the application by the Government of Saskatchewan is granted in part such that the claim is dismissed against it except for the claims alleging conspiracy and breach of Charter rights;","FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.
 The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.
 Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police.
The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die.
The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA).
Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired.
The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute.
HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994.
The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed.
Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial.
It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants.
As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code.
Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue.
The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA.
Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural.
The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA.
The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation.
The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute.
2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed.
The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted.
The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general.
3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings.
The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck.
They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose.
4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches.
The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts.
Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence.
If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection.
A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys.
Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.
 5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component.
An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact.
6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset.
The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended.
It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.
 7)No costs.","[320, 323, 3, 7, 8, 17, 14, 13, 11, 311, 0]"
806,"On Appeal From: Q.B. 7030/85 J.C. Regina
Appeal File: 2200
Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson
On August 13, 1993, Firstline responded to the summons saying ""there is debt [sic] to Reuban [sic] David, by Firstline Trust Company.
The Bank's position was that the garnishee summons was sufficient to compel payment to it on the GIC's maturity date.
There may be decisions to the contrary in other jurisdictions, but the author of Creditor-Debtor Law in Canada expresses the view at p. 385 of his text that this approach “represents current Canadian law”.
Given this is the present state of the law as it relates to promissory note, have to ask if there is any significant difference between promissory note and GIC.
Given virtually every obligation is subject to assignment one is led to wonder why the prospect of assignment is only applicable to promissory notes and obligations of similar nature.
The best that can answer is that in most cases the debt is one that is due and the garnishee is effective immediately so no right then remains which would be subject to assignment.
These cases refer to include Bel-Fran Investments Ltd. v. Pantuity Holdings Limited and Bank of Montreal (Garnishee), 1975 CanLII 917 (BC SC), [1975]","The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David.
First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity.
When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate.
Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application.
The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.
 1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable.
3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.
 4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable.
The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due.
Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas.
The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment.
Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due.
5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose.
It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances.
DISSENT:
The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date.
The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation.
There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","[1, 2, 0, 306, 307, 303, 31, 312, 300, 15]"
807,"The Original Custody Judgment provided for joint custody of the child, C.A.S.M.M., born June 26, 2001, (the “child”) with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.
[3] The mother filed material indicating she was “vehemently opposed” to the father’s application for custody and “would prefer that she be in the custody of another relative such as my parents or even in foster care instead of with the respondent”.
[4] The father filed a further application on December 8, 2006, seeking an order allowing him to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes.
The father shall also provide 30 days’ notice to the mother of any intention to change this residence.
(i) telephone access to the child twice per week, with such telephone access to be supervised by the father or his designate if the father wishes to continue telephone supervision;
(ii) internet webcam access as an alternative, at the mother’s option, to the aforesaid telephone access immediately upon the father’s relocation with the child to Whitehorse;
(iv) following the child’s relocation to Whitehorse, the mother shall have supervised personal access to the child for three days per month for up to two hours per day.
The supervisor of the personal access shall be Ms. J. Laird or any other supervisor agreed to by the father and the mother.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.
The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment.
The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order.
The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody.
The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother.
The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes.
The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child.
The issues were as follows.
1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child?
2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon?
3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother?
HELD: Application allowed.
The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1)
The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child.
The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible.
As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case.
Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father.
2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse.
In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse.
3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply.
Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","[267, 1, 268, 5, 4, 265, 261, 264]"
808,"[1] Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to The Queen’s Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board made on May 21, 2004 and June 24, 2004.
[10] The Attorney General for Saskatchewan maintains that the Court should decline to hear the Charter issue until it has been ruled upon by the Board.
In the alternative, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan maintains that s. is permissive and does not infringe the freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(d) of the Charter.
1. What constitutes the record of the Board proceedings in this particular case?
2. What is the applicable standard of review in this case?
Wal-Mart Canada says that if the Board had not so interpreted s. 9, it would have focused on the testimony of all the witnesses before it that Wal-Mart Canada has not intimidated its employees.
[99] Although Wal-Mart Canada has legitimate concerns about the direction the hearing has taken to date, as indicated previously, cannot agree that the Board has ruled on or interpreted s. in the fashion submitted by Wal-Mart Canada.
Such decisions are understandably reviewed by the court on correctness standard.
decision that is “unreasonable” but is not “irrational” cannot be set aside.","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.
The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents.
Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done.
Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional.
HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW.
The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back.
1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.
 2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness.
3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects.
First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce.
The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced.
There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy.
It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed.
Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents.
The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it.
It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations.
4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did.
The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders.
The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.
 5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination.
It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6)
Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation.
Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue.
Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made.
7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal.
If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant.
The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.
 8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter.
Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways.
First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW.
If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights.
If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional.
However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","[24, 23, 404, 1, 410, 403, 21, 22, 413]"
809,"COUNSEL; R. Ritchie Wheeler, Esq., for the plaintiff
D. Geoffrey Machum, Esq., for the defendant
J.: On November 5, 1991, the plaintiff, Mr. Grant, together with three other sales agents employed by the defendant, herein ""Allstate"", were notified their employment was being terminated.
Nevertheless, and although Allstate has not, at any time, sought to justify the termination on the basis of cause, there were concerns expressed about Mr. Grant's lack of productivity in obtaining new policies and, in particular, in writing new life insurance policies.
The plaintiff declined to accept the program on the basis the Neighbourhood Office Program required the agent to fund their own expenses and would not, in his opinion and in his circumstances, be of benefit to him.
Similarly, in respect to the Neighbourhood Office Program, the transfer of responsibility for office expenses to the agent would, in the view of Mr. Grant, result in an overall reduction in his level of compensation.
This proceeding, by the plaintiff, is founded on the basis the period provided by the employer was not reasonable, in the context of this implied term of the employment contract.
Counsel continues by suggesting the reasons of Justice Roscoe indicate
""... Under the circumstances and in view of the uniqueness of the situation, there being no previously decided cases on the precise point (as acknowledged by both counsel),there will be no order as to costs.""","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years.
As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation.
The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages.
He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal.
The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages.
Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months.
Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified.
Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable.
Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears.
Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","[1, 0, 289, 2, 280, 14, 256, 16, 9]"

The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children.
Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times).
The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded.
If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that.
Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan.
Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation.
A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance.
Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","[280, 277, 6, 9, 5, 8, 258, 259, 262, 13]"

No satisfactory proof was offered that suggested differently and can only find that, in this regard, the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of proof.
Even if were wrong in finding no negligence on the part of the defendants, there is no satisfactory evidence that any of the plaintiff's damage resulted from the acts of the defendants.

813,"Evidence taken in Cape Dorset, Nunavut, September 27/00
PLACE HEARD: Barrington, Shelburne Co., NS
COUNSEL: Timothy D. Landry Esq. On behalf of the Applicant
THE APPLICATION:
This is an application for custody of the child, David Douglas Tunnillie, born August 28, 1992 in Cape Dorset, Nunavut and the parties are the natural parents of the child.
On November 24, 1999 following written decision the Court issued an Order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act.
The reason for this move appears to be new relationship and the desire of the mother to have David know his father better.
The father did not return the child but made an application to Family Court for custody.
The Court has great sympathy for the Respondent mother and the situation she found herself in.
He has to spend considerable time with his mother to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture.
Access will be every summer from the second week in July until and including the third week in August which is seven full weeks.
Given the financial situation of the Respondent mother, it shall be the responsibility of the Applicant father to provide transportation costs both ways.
Chief Judge of the Family Court","This was a hearing to determine the proper venue for a custody hearing.
The parties resided together in 1991 and 1992 in the Territory of Nunavut.
The first language of the respondent mother and the child is Inuktitut.
The child, born in 1993, lived with the mother in Nunavut until 1999, when he moved to Nova Scotia to be with the father by agreement of both parties.
This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother.
Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","[5, 4, 7, 122, 8, 9, 118, 110, 116, 0, 115, 18, 20]"

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal.
The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges.
Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.
1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth.
There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts.
2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.

The plaintiff and Slater then entered into discussions about the specifications and ultimately agreed upon them.
He incurred repair costs of $764.62 and lost rental income of $1,400.00.
Finally, he suffered loss of $1,000.00 as result of deficiencies.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower.
The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff.
HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61.
The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim.

They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for.
2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost.
3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant.
Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment.
The charges were found to be fit and proper.
4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies.
5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties.
The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest.

816,"SCR 811 [Vetrovec]) should be given to the jury in relation to the testimony of Ms. Saxon and Mr. Windrum.
Defence counsel initially, and quite strongly, argued in favour of its inclusion.
(a) she never initiated contact with the police;
He told the jury that it was for them to decide if they believed the witnesses.
Finally, they were reminded that it was open to them to believe some, none, or all of witness’s testimony.
Furthermore, the trial judge fairly and accurately set out Mr. Smith’s evidence and his theory of defence, which pinned the shooting on Ms. Saxon.
Given all this, the jurors were adequately positioned to fairly analyze the evidence and assess the testimony of the Crown’s witnesses in light of the evidence as whole and, as such, any concern about the conflicting testimony was sufficiently brought to light in the jury charge.
I am also satisfied that, in exercising his discretion not to give a Vetrovec warning, he was particularly alert to the position advanced by defence counsel, which he clearly understood to be a tactical choice.
Taken as whole, am satisfied that the trial judge properly instructed himself and that there was clear foundation for how he exercised his discretion.","Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury
The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury.
He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim.
The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well.
During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence.
The defence counsel then withdrew his application.
The victim had been a friend of the appellant.
According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard.
The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash.
S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other.
She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life.
The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun.
As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun.
The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field.
Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered.
The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013.
She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident.
At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was.
When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant.
S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident.
The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons.
The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery.
The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck.
The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns.
S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times.
She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems.
The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend.
Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times.
On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later.
The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident.
In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning.
It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel.
The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury.
The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury.
The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","[503, 8, 516, 505, 512, 9, 500, 502, 479]"

Accordingly, any jurisdictional or procedural objections on the mother’s part are obviated.

818,"[3] In April, 1998, the plaintiff contracted to build pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc.
In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant, as sub-contractor, to construct directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River.

On the other hand, the defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site.
This is claim for damages in the amount of $3,476,610.00 and alleges failure by the defendant to fulfill the contact.

(3) that pending the posting of the security the claim of the plaintiff, Banister Pipelines Inc., shall be stayed;
(5) that the application to have PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. declared liable for any award of costs is dismissed; and","FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000.
1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court.
The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.
 2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs.
Rather, it is a factor to be considered.
In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim.
It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3)
The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action.
Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate.
It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding.
4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated.
The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000.
The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","[216, 218, 210, 211, 5, 6, 215, 212, 7, 9, 209, 14]"

Mr. Dubelt paid Klassen $2,500 for his assistance on the assault charge.
Following his conviction Mr. Dubelt utilized the assistance of Klassen in preparing notice of appeal in which the grounds are related to factual issues.
Technically the affidavit of Mr. Dubelt is “fresh evidence” meant to demonstrate the ineffective assistance of the agent Klassen at trial.
[5] This fresh evidence is not directed to factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court on the basis that the agent Klassen’s ineffectual assistance resulted in miscarriage of justice.
These two cases stand for the proposition that if upon review of the fresh evidence miscarriage of justice has not occurred it is not admissible.
(1) What standard of representation if any is an accused entitled to when represented by non-lawyer agent at trial?
The most recent and useful discussion in this area from our Court of Appeal is R. v. L.W.T., 2008 SKCA 17 (CanLII), [2008]","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed.
1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred.
There was no unfairness in the trial process.
The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him.
He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on.
There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant.
He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made.
On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer.
2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant.
The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case.
He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen.
The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen.
The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v.

The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.
The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced.
It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000.
The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial.
She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.
As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants.

He informed me that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined.
This is the stage in the foreclosure proceeding to not only seek confirmation of the sale, but also to seek the court’s direction on the payment of the purchase monies, including costs.
It is the stage to set the deficiency amount of the judgment, if any.
All these outstanding matters ought to be addressed in one final proceeding.
DIRECTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL
Plaintiff’s counsel may obtain date for the next court proceeding from the local registrar.","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi.
It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price.
Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000.
If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs.
Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.
Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application.
All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","[0, 7, 77, 71, 72, 73, 11, 15, 70, 16, 17]"

[1] The Crown appeals the imposition of a six month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order against the respondent for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s. 334(a).
[2] Clearly the maximum allowable probation period is three years and therefore the sentence imposed below is unenforceable.
[3] The appeal is therefore allowed and the following order is made:
 That a restitution order pursuant to section 738 in the amount of $8,518 be paid directly to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3.
That the six month conditional sentence is affirmed with the conditions as originally ordered with an additional condition:
He shall pay restitution to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 - 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing June 1, 1997.
That the period of probation is decreased to three years following the expiration of the six month conditional sentence.
The terms of the probation order are affirmed save and except condition which is amended to read:
Pay Restitution in the amount of $8,518 directly to Mr. Hal Schmidt, c/o Family Pizza, Bay #10, 318 105th Street, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N 1Z3 at the rate of at least $200 per month commencing in December 1, 1997 until the full amount is paid.","The Crown appealed the six month conditional sentence with 45 months probation and a restitution order for the offence of stealing money in excess of $5,000 contrary to s334(a).

The issue in this appeal is whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada pursuant to Section 530(1) of the Criminal Code.
If so, what are the consequences of Provincial Court Judge’s failure to do so?
The facts are brief and not in dispute.
The Appellant pleaded not guilty to Section 266 of the Criminal Code.
The Provincial Court Judge set the trial for October 13, 1998, without advising the Appellant of his rights to trial in French or English pursuant to Section 531(1) and (2) of the Criminal Code contrary to Section 530(3) of the Criminal Code.
The trial was held in English on October 13, 1998.
At trial, the Appellant was represented by Counsel.
The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court Judge to advise the Appellant of his rights to trial in French or English pursuant to Section 530 of the Code.

828,"1. The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of The University of Saskatchewan Act, and in particular Section 51.
2. This error resulted because, among other things, the Arbitrator failed to apply principles/doctrines of statutory interpretation; including but not limited to his failure to consider: the context and purpose of the legislation; the doctrine of presumed intent of the legislature; the contextual approach; and, the doctrine that the interpretation should not produce an absurd result.
[3] Section 51 of the Act states:
(a) no person is to be appointed as faculty member unless that person has been nominated for the position by the president; and
(2) Does the interpretation of s. 51 by the Arbitrator meet the applicable standard of review?
[36] The Arbitrator acknowledged that other universities based on their legislation and/or policies make reference to tenure as an appointment or promotion, but rejected that such was the case in the Act.
He referred to the past practice of tenure being the subject of collective bargaining, and why it was reasonable to leave the final decision with the Board of Governors.
The decision satisfies the reasonableness standard.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness.
Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly.
Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public.
The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past.
The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout.
To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn.
The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","[324, 10, 5, 15, 316, 6, 319, 7]"

[1] We do not need to hear from you, Ms. Paulsen.
For convenience we reproduce the following passages from her written reasons:
pre-trial management conference is set for October 5, 2004, after which trial date will be set.
It is likely that the trial will proceed in December, 2004 or January, 2005.
It must be kept in mind that the application for variation does not relate to final order, but rather an interim one.
As such, there is no need to vary the interim order.
First, this Court is extremely reluctant to interfere with the discretion of chamber or trial judge with respect to questions of interim maintenance.
Second, the most desirable thing in almost every instance is to proceed as rapidly as possible to trial so that the matter can be determined finally after full examination of all of the relevant evidence.
Also see Lapoor v. Navidi (2000), 2000 SKCA 95 (CanLII), 14 R.F.L. (5th) 125.
[11] The respondent’s motion under Rule 15 is now moot.
Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party.

(b) If necessary, remitting the matter back to the Rentalsman for determination.
[2] Prior to hearing the merits of the application itself, counsel for the respondent, Nadine Onoushko, raised a preliminary objection with the court and argued that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the decision of the Rentalsman in accordance with the provisions of s. 49(1) of The Residential Tenancies Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. R-22 as am. by S.S. 1992, c. 37, s. 18 (the “Act”).
Section 49(1) reads as follows:
49(1) Any person who is aggrieved by decision or order of the Rentalsman may appeal the decision or order on question of law or of jurisdiction of the Rentalsman to judge of Her Majesty’s Court of Queen’s Bench for Saskatchewan within 30 days of the date of the decision or order.
In order to appeal the applicant should have filed notice of the appeal on or before January 7, 1998.
[4] The applicant, in her affidavit states that she never received notice of any of the proceedings before the Rentalsman therefore making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days.
[6] Therefore, the preliminary objection by counsel for the respondent, Nadine Onoushko, to the application is dismissed and the local registrar is instructed to return the matter to the chambers’ list on August 19, 1999 in order to hear argument on the merits and to allow counsel for the respondents an opportunity to file material.","The applicant sought an Order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1) and 674.
The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit.
The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days.
HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed.
The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits.
Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.","[8, 10, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 3]"

Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution.
[3] The trial judge disagreed.
[4] Whether the trial judge erred in either respect is best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of The Family Property Act, and the distribution made by the trial judge.
However, again as read his judgment he was simply using less than precise language to note the loans were not likely to be repaid.
[125] Because the loan was not statute barred at the date of the petition it was open to the trial judge to choose that date to determine if the debt ought to be exempt as opposed to the date of the action as he did in Thompson v. Thompson.[15]
In that case the trial judge found the loan, (although statute barred), from the party's family member likely to be repaid upon the lender's death out of the borrower's share of the estate and exempted the loan.

The couple had lived together for several years.
She sought judgment distributing their property.
The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents.
The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents.
The respondent appealed.
HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority.
Lane J.A. wrote in dissent.
Majority: 1)
The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship.
The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act.
There are a number of facts that merit emphasis.
The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started.
He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced.
He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced.
By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000.
2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property.
There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point.
The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete.
He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act.
On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property.
The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage.
Minority: 1)
The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act.
The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together.
In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2)
The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents.
He made a finding the loans were statute-barred.
The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent.
He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid.
He simply used less than precise language.","[528, 526, 519, 518, 13, 517, 10, 530, 533, 0, 529, 9]"

[1] On December 4, 1999 the plaintiff Brad Morash, while working as security officer for The Bay store in MicMac mall, was run down in crosswalk in the mall parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter.
The van that struck him was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by second individual.
As result of the impact, the plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries, mainly to his right knee.
[7] The events of December 4, 1999 began to unfold around p.m. when the plaintiff and another security officer observed man acting suspiciously in The Bay store.
The man was extremely irate and even threatened to kill the plaintiff.

The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer.
As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages.
The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed.
The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","[228, 18, 0, 236, 25, 238, 7, 6, 21, 5]"

of the Estate.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father.
Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties.
The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one.
The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses.
The eldest required braces.
The mother's income was $1,089 per month.
The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order.
The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children.
The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance.
HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance.
Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.
 1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application.
The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander).
A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor.
The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently.
The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children.
3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles.
Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.

On or about the 24th day of February, A.D. 2002, at or near Kindersley District, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in her possession a controlled substance, to wit, cannabis marihuana in an amount exceeding three kilograms, for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
[6] After Constable Wilson pulled the accused’s vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway he exited his patrol car and approached the accused’s vehicle.
[8] Constable Wilson testified that he approached the accused’s vehicle and requested her driver’s licence and vehicle registration.
Constable Wilson could smell very strong odour of raw cannabis coming from the interior of the vehicle and as the accused provided her driver’s licence he noticed dark green stain on it which he said looked like cannabis resin.
At this point in time Constable Wilson said he formed the opinion that there was cannabis marihuana in the vehicle and he advised the accused that he could smell cannabis marihuana in the vehicle and that it appeared that there was hash oil on her driver’s licence.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest.
At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded.
HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached.
1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest.
2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there.
3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","[0, 35, 22, 36, 30]"

The Minister apprehended the child at birth.
The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry.
The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child.
The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.

Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents.
The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college.
In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties.

The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property.
This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.

840,"Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.
Circumstances and Summary of the Evidence
He admitted to having just purchased three grams of cocaine for $140.00.
The cocaine found on his person was seized by the police.
[6] The police were forced to use ram to open the steel frame front door.
The door was breached on the third attempt and the police entered.
The SGI records show value of $8,000.00 for the truck and not $16,000.00 as deposed to by Mr. Metz.
[69] With regard to Mr. Florek, Mr. Butler claims he gave second statement to the police effectively denying the statement had given at the time of the search.
[70] On a common sense view of the evidence before me, I find it more likely than not the money was proceeds of unlawful activity.
[72] Mr. Butler bears the onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.
As he put forth no such evidence or argument to support the application of this exception to his circumstances, it has not been established.
CONCLUSION [73] The seized property is proceeds of unlawful activity.","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure.
The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure.
The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability.
The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application.
The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective.
Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity.
The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act.
An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016.
The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period.
The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;
 2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply.
The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade.
The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000.
The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice.
The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","[4, 271, 12, 264, 11, 267, 273, 5, 13, 263, 15, 272]"

2. Should the child support variation in this matter be retroactive? and
3. Should costs of this application be granted to either Mr. Pilat or Ms. Lilley?
Further, have grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding, which delays were primarily the result of Mr. Pilat's unwillingness to provide adequate financial disclosure.

(4) Ms. Lilley shall have costs in this matter which are hereby set in the sum of $750.00 payable by Mr. Pilat forthwith.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.
He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated.
HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest.
In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination.
Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment.
He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000.
The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year.
It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances.
The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable.
2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter.
3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income.
4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted.
The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.
 In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.
 5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith.
The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful.
Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax.
It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order.
The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure.
Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","[111, 105, 2, 103, 110, 8, 106, 6, 5, 9]"

843,"E. Kalenith, P.C.J. JUDGMENT
INTRODUCTION
[1] Marjorie Hanson applies for relief pursuant to The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“the Charter”) on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.
My reasons follow.
[2] The accused is charged that:
Count unlawfully produce Cannabis Marihuana contrary to Section of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (“the CDSA”) and
Count unlawfully possess Cannabis Marihuana in an amount not exceeding three kilograms for the purpose of trafficking contrary to Section 5(2) of the CDSA.
The Crown argues that the accused could have applied to amend her conditions of release, as she did in September 2004 and March 2005, so as to alleviate any restrictions that prevented her from obtaining better paying jobs.
While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, I find that these could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release.
[18] Given the finding of actual prejudice, the question remains as to whether the prejudice to the accused was such as to outweigh the prejudice to society that would result if the accused was not to face trial for this charge.
[19] The Crown suggests, and find, that there is heightened public interest in offences of this nature, as there is in offences of violence, in having these offences tried.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.
HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.
 1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months.
The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable.
This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused.
6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court.
The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.
3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial.
While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release.
4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.
No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","[7, 0, 8, 1, 4, 79, 78, 2, 5, 77, 73]"

March 14, 2001
[1] consent judgment of January 10, 2000 arising out of settlement pre-trial conference provides, inter alia:
3. AND IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Respondent, Ronald Kim Fellinger, shall pay the Petitioner, Layna Kathleen Segall, for the support, maintenance, and education of the children the sum of $1,000.00 per month, such sum representing basic child support of $774.00 per month and further $226.00 per month for the Respondent's proportionate share of child care costs.
The respondent says his income is reduced and refers to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34.
Has there been some other material change of circumstance which would make the agreed upon amount of support inappropriate?
In this regard it is noted that the respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his father provided him with ""gifts"" as he describes them.
His father passed away prior to the pre-trial conference.
The respondent says his mother does not have the means but there is no evidence in this regard.
The situation is somewhat akin to that where payor, particularly the self-employed, claim his or her income has changed substantially.

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000.
The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances.
This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference.
It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service.
There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule.
The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends.
The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times.
This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","[111, 3, 0, 106, 4, 11, 103, 107, 98, 7, 102]"
845,"[1] The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the Defendant’s cattle getting into the Plaintiff’s canola field in late July, 1999.
[4] In my view, the law in Saskatchewan is clear that cattle owner is liable for such loss as is caused by the entry of his cattle onto the crop of another.
Sections 27 (1) and (2) of The Stray Animals Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. S-60, provide as follows:
[6] The present s. 27 (1) has been in the Act since 1977, when the Act was substantially re-written, apparently in response to the increasing urbanization of the province.
At para. (Carswell) the Court said the following with respect to the 1920 Act:
(No evidence was put before the court challenging this price, and accept it as the market value for damage calculation.)
[26] Had the Plaintiffs been able to combine the crop in the normal fashion, they would have been assessed dockage at the elevator.
Based on the dockage set out on the cash ticket in evidence (5%)
[29] Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 is therefore granted in favour of the Plaintiffs, together with Pre-judgment interest from January 5, 2000 and costs.
Dated at the City of Melfort in the Province of Saskatchewan this 8th day of June, 2000.
OF SASKATCHEWAN","The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field.
The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD:
Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45.
The court valued the loss at $3,052.36.
It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production.
Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act.
A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle. 
This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence.
The issue here is the quantum of the damage.
The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case.
An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels.
The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","[1, 5, 114, 110, 103, 6, 15, 95, 111, 11, 102]"

847,"JUDGMENT MALONE J.
February 13, 2002
[1] The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property.
They both testified that at the time of the marriage they agreed to keep their assets separate and to not make claim on the assets of the other.
The respondent testified that they agreed ""each would own what they have"".
(i) owned by or leased to one or both spouses, or in which one or both spouses have an interest, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an interest pursuant to partnership or trust or an interest as purchase pursuant to an agreement for sale; or
(b) that is or has been occupied by one or both spouses as the family home or that is mutually intended by the spouses to be occupied by one or both of them as the family home;
[14] I am not satisfied there is any ""extraordinary circumstance"" as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the value of the family home from being divided equally between the parties.
[16] The petitioner therefore is entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being:➢ One-half of the value of the condominium $42,000.00 ➢ One-half of the value of the furniture, vehicle and camper $12,000.00 $54,000.00","The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property.
They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997.
Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value.
They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.
 The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.
HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000.
1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention.
This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act.
The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death.
2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).

SHERSTOBITOFF J.A. (orally)
[1] This appeal is from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.
The issue is whether s. 5.3 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. T-17, authorizes the Board to make such an order.
[2] The facts are set out in the judgment of Barclay J.
[3] The relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:
[10] Furthermore, s. 25(1), when read with ss. (1.1) and (1.2), indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements.
Nor is there anything in s. 25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant supervisory or other powers to the Labour Relations Board in respect of the arbitration process.
Whatever the scope of s. 42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the Labour Relations Board to act in respect of such matters.","An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.
At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question.
The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable.
2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.
 3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB.
The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","[0, 32, 5, 4, 3, 29, 7, 6, 34]"
849,"BACKGROUND [1] The plaintiff brings action for water damage sustained to her former residence located at 233 - 1st Street South, Martensville, when frozen pipes burst.
II EVIDENCE ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
She rented the house to her son for $500.00 per month up until September, 2005, when her son vacated the premises.
Her intent was to sell the property to her daughter, Jennifer and her husband, David, who were then living in Saskatoon.
Her recollection was that she instructed the water be shut off effective the day she was in because she was having the power cut off shortly thereafter, which was effective on December 10.
[5] She did not recall signing any authorization to this effect.
She noted on her file that Ms. Webster advised that the property would either be moved or demolished in the spring.
b) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water lines, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained.
How much damage this would have caused is difficult, if not impossible, to assess compared to the damage occasioned to the point of being attended to by the neighbour;
c) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself.
[22] The plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.
There is no order as to costs.
PCJ R.D. Jackson","The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst.
The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water.
2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained.
3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself.
She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property.
No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned.
Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","[0, 76, 83, 3, 82, 81, 73, 75, 6, 11, 10, 7, 66]"
850,"1) In 1998 the plaintiff, Sylvia Snider, now Sylvia Schira, decided to purchase home.
It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski.
Their realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, the owner of the last defendant, Trevi Holdings Ltd.
Prior to trial, Mr. Jacobucci and Trevi Holdings Ltd. entered into confidential agreement with Ms. Schira.
13) Ms. Schira decided she wanted to view the property, even though she knew it was not within her means.
In the short time she was there, Ms. Schira fell in love with the house.

Docket: Q.B. No. 365 of 2000
Counsel: G. D. Dufour for the plaintiff
to October 6, 2009 Judgment (2009 SKQB 394)
1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87.","The plaintiff bought a house.
She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon.
The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski.
The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations.
She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects.
She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser.
She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her.
The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently.
The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors.
Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages.
The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses.
Two main issues are raised.
The first is the liability of each of the defendants.
The second issue is quantum of damages.
The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues.
HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract.
Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation.
Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage.
In that respect their liability is concurrent.
The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several.
As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.
 1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17.
It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events.
The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283.
2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt.
3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court.
They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action.
Their evidence was largely unchallenged.
The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters.
Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved.
No inspection was done after the house was moved.
4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS).
The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting.
The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house.
The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems.
It should have been disclosed.
Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage.
The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper.
The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5)
It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS.
A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007]
O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL).
The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage.
The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home.
With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply.
6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff.
The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168.
7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent.
8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999.
She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase.
Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion.
At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed.
Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case.
The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment.
Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different.
Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase.
9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation.
He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'.
This was incorrect.
Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS.
He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage.
He also knew the skylight leaked.
The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.
 10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613.
She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home.
There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract.
She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages.
Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed.
Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business.
The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal.
Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full.
Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties.
Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","[144, 154, 150, 143, 0, 151, 4, 10, 139, 12, 20]"
852,"WRITTEN RELEASE
Donald Presse, Esq., for the Respondent
The applicant here is requesting an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial The Queen v. Joseph Glenn Jessome.
For the record, refer to paragraphs to 10 of that affidavit:
4. On March 2. 1993, the Applicant elected to be tried in Provincial Court.
10. On July 5, 1993, the parties appeared before His Honour Judge Ross Archibald for trial.
refer also to the case of Re Skogman and The Queen 1984 CanLII 22 (SCC), 13 C.C.C.(3d), 161, and specifically the comments of Justice Estey at page 167:
It need only be added by way of emphasis that such certiorari review does not authorize superior court to reach inside the functioning of the statutory tribunal for the purpose of challenging decision reached by that tribunal within its assigned jurisdiction on the ground that the tribunal committed an error of law in reaching that decision, or reached conclusion different from that which the reviewing tribunal might have reached.
The sequence of events leading up to the adjournment provided an adequate basis upon which the judge could exercise his discretion in favour of granting the adjournment.
There was sufficient material before the court upon which the court could satisfy itself that the second test as set out in Darville was met.
There have been numerous cases before the court wherein the court has made discretionary decision based on submissions of counsel.","The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial.
In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial.
The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.
Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial.
The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend.
An adjournment was granted.
The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.
Dismissing the application.
It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.
Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law.
Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion.
If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ.
In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment.
There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","[3, 67, 0, 70, 66, 16, 9, 59, 6, 8, 60]"

[4] As to the possible application of s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, it should be noted that subsection (7) of s. says that where provision of the section conflicts with the provision of an enactment governing an appeal, the provision of the enactment prevails.
Accordingly, 14(2) of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act prevails over s. 9(6) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000.

859,"[1] Sean Fleury (“Fleury”) appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.
The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with Fleury’s guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.
The police photographs showed that tire tracks left the highway perpendicular to it, drove for about 25 feet, then up hill scraping the sod clear, travelling an additional 10 feet, then no visible tracks until the minivan landed in the slough.
No one was at the scene, and Cst. Poiré called for the dive team to investigate.
It seems unlikely that minivan could make 90° left turn at substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two or three lanes it had to travel before leaving the pavement perpendicular to Highway #2.
And, it seems unlikely that the minivan could navigate such sharp left turn at high speed without rolling.
However, this is information that is beyond the general knowledge of trial judge.
[9] Because the Crown’s evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, it has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

J. A. R. Rothery","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.
The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway.
Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving.
The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.
The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign.
In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described.
HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.
However, no expert was called.
The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","[29, 25, 24, 20, 0, 1, 19, 18, 4, 3]"

The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university.
The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order.

The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university.
2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion.
Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","[3, 102, 7, 97, 8, 93, 92, 103, 98]"

CAMERON J.A.
This is an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer.
STC took issue with these premises, contending the trial judge had erred in relation to each of them.
(i) The salary.
That being so, and since STC broke its promise, thus depriving Mr. Larsen of the opportunity to earn such salary, we are of the view the trial judge did not err in employing the figure of $110,000 in determining the loss of income and hence the damages in this respect.
(ii) The period of notice.
The basic facts are these.
Mr. Larsen was forty-seven year old commerce graduate and chartered accountant who, before being dismissed by STC, had successively served three provincial Crown corporations over period of about ten years.
The net income was simply left to accumulate in the company.
We are not persuaded by these arguments.
And so we have decided to reduce his damages by some $16,000 to $17,000.
It follows, then, that the appeal will be allowed to the extent of reducing this head of damages from $165,000 to $148,500.
Otherwise the judgment at trial will stand.
There will be no order for costs on the appeal.","On appeal from 106 SaskR 277.
47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal.

The form of the affidavit was not in compliance with Rule 318 and 319 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court.

HELD: Application dismissed.
The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default.

There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed.
The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so.
The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.

circumstances"", per Grotsky J. in Thole v. McKenna, supra, to
for costs at this stage of the action.
In the exercise of my discretion, I would dismiss SaskPower\'s motion.
The plaintiff","FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan.
HELD: The motion was dismissed.
 1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply.
Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan.
Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application.
The action was commenced in April 1996.
Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order.
To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.
 3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","[8, 5, 9, 15, 17, 14, 4, 11, 321, 328, 1, 12, 319, 327, 324, 311, 303, 310, 44, 317, 326, 305, 306, 323, 318, 51, 312]"
872,"1) Mr. Merchant brings two separate notices of motion.
The lawsuit asserts that the Defendants failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts including the (1)
Playa Costa Verda/Playa Pesquero; (2)
In order to be advanced as class action, the lawsuit must be certified by the Court of Queen’s Bench.
The application is currently scheduled to be heard during the week of January 25th, 2010 before the Honourable Mr. Justice Keene.
Even though dismissed both motions brought by MLG wish to exercise my discretion and not award costs.
68) I therefore dismiss both motions brought by MLG without costs.
69) In my previous fiat indicated that depending on the outcome of this particular matter would be putting forth schedule to help get this file moving ahead.
70) Therefore taking into consideration that this matter has been adjourned and would have been done by now; it seems reasonable that there has to be deadline to file amendments, briefs, or any other material.
Accordingly order that the deadline to serve and file any amendments to the pleadings, motions, further briefs of law or any other material shall be December 2, 2009 at 4:00 p.m. Regina time.
Reply means service and filing of all such reply documents by December 11, 2009, at 4:00 p.m. Regina time.","Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.
HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.
 1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant.
This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals.
The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue.
This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on.
The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do.
There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit.
In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed.
There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.
 2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients.
The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members.
However, that case is not similar to this case.
In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements.
Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's.
The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.'
As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act.
Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","[187, 7, 186, 188, 192, 15, 195, 193, 0, 17, 6]"

Smith J.A. [1] This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons herein set out.
The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation.
The appellant had assumed substantial portion of her support.
[7] The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption that she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage.
The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000.
He also still had the same medical issues and the couples’ daughter Catherine was still living with him and going to university full time.
The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student.
[9] In addition to the factual error or errors, it is our respectful view that the approach of Sandomirsky J. on a review of the issue of spousal support in light of the judgment of Ottenbreit J. was in error.
[10] The order of Sandomirsky J. is set aside, the respondent’s application for spousal support is dismissed and the order against the appellant for costs below is set aside.","The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation.
They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant.
Both parties have some health problems.
Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.
Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible.
The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment.
She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica.
She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced.
HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside.
The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage.
He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment.
The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant.
He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.
It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient.
The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","[0, 71, 67, 3, 10, 66, 63, 6, 59, 64]"
874,"HEARD: Before the Honourable Justice John D. Murphy, Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on December 17, 2001.
RELEASE OF ORAL: January 29, 2002
COUNSEL: Gary Holt, Q.C., for the Crown
MURPHY, J. [1] Frederick Black has been charged with three counts of fraud, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of NsC Diesel Power Inc. (“NsC”), a bankrupt corporation.
[5] Mr Black has not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the Charter Motions.
[10] The RCMP officers involved have testified that they were not influenced by Mr. Redling or by anyone else in the OSB in the course of their investigation into the activities of Mr. Black.
[11] am not convinced that Mr. Redling is likely to have any relevant or material evidence to provide with respect to the Charter Motions; have reached that conclusion based on the information and submissions concerning his involvement in the investigations which have been provided during this application, and also based on all the evidence given during the Charter Motions’ hearings.","The accused, charged with fraud, brought a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis that his Charter rights had been violated by the RCMP and the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy.
The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed.
Application dismissed;
the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions.
The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","[2, 0, 3, 28, 30, 15, 6]"
875,"[1] The RCMP received Crime Stoppers tip suggesting that the respondent, Ms. Jennifer Durling, was growing marijuana in home she rented in Coldbrook, Kings County.
Ms. Durling was charged with producing and possessing marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.
[2] At trial before Provincial Court Judge Alan T. Tufts (""the judge""), Ms. Durling challenged the validity of the search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information.
This led to Ms. Durling's acquittal.
[3] The Crown has appealed to this court.
Consequently, the evidence obtained as result of the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same.
Officer Huett then made certain amendments and applied second time.
[6] The amended application included details that summarize as follows:
[29] For all these reasons conclude that the judge's approach to this issue reveals an extricable legal error which we must address.
As revealed in the voir dire, the tipster reported to have personal knowledge as opposed to reporting hearsay.
The covered basement windows further corroborated the alleged illegal activity.
[31] Thus, on the evidence presented, conclude that the search warrant was quashed in error.
It follows that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.
Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence.
The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test.
The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion.
Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.
Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it.
By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","[200, 8, 0, 3, 14, 204, 4, 9, 196, 199, 19, 21, 187]"
876,"[1] The tenants, Rob Grey and Stephanie Grey, appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.S. 2006, c. R-22.0001 (the Act).
[3] The basic facts are these.
The parties executed one year written residential lease on August 23, 2011.
The tenants were given notice of hearing and the hearing proceeded before hearing officer on May 31, 2012.
Both parties attended.
The decision provided:
That said, it is commonplace among judicial and quasi‑judicial decision‑makers, whether explicitly or implicitly required to give reasons setting forth the facts and explaining the basis for their decisions, to refer to those portions of the evidence having significant probative value in relation to fact in controversy, particularly those portions with opposing force or weight, for it is here where the case on the facts rises or falls on balance.
[20] Having concluded the appeal should succeed for the reasons given, find it unnecessary to determine if the hearing officer erred in not considering the tenant's and the landlord's applications at the same time.
The Act addresses powers, procedure, evidentiary issues, and to some extent scheduling, in sections 73-78.
In any event, the simple fact tenant’s application is not formally before hearing officer at the same time as landlord’s application does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord’s dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant’s facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order.
[21] The appeal is allowed.
J. L.M. SCHWANN","The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act.
The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted.
The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent.
The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem.
They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal.
HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs.
However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.
The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation.
The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","[80, 12, 76, 4, 0, 3, 75, 82, 15, 79, 13, 72]"

The Honourable Madam Justice Gerwing
Smith J.A. 1] This is an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1.
[3] The circumstances of the offence are as follows: H., whose date of birth is November 21, 1988, along with two adults, agreed to commit robbery.
H. then called Pizza Hut and requested that pizza and Coke be delivered to false address.
H. requested that the delivery person bring change for $100.00 bill.
This was case of armed robbery, with the use of gun, committed against vulnerable member of society.
It occurred only 10 days after the conclusion of his last imposed period of open custody and while he was still subject to the community supervision portion of his previous sentence.
He was 16 years old and had no prior criminal record.
[17] The Crown’s application for leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent is granted and the appeal is allowed.
[18] The respondent has already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed.
He will also be subject to a 10 year firearms prohibition as in the original sentence.","This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code.
The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition.
HELD: Appeal allowed orally.
The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.
 1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all.
It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted.
The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant.
Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.
2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","[82, 2, 0, 85, 12, 81, 3, 76, 13, 14, 70, 67]"
878,"Reasons By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
LANE J.A. (orally)
[1] The Crown seeks leave appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.
[2] The facts are essentially agreed and are as follows:
On March 19, 2000, the respondent, Nelson Kahnapace, and co‑accused, Wayne Moshenko, did break and enter dwelling house in Regina, the residence of 68 year‑old man who lives alone, and committed robbery.
The respondent was very intoxicated and did not participate in the beginning of the transaction.
The co-accused told him they were going there because the victim had the keys to Moshenko's vehicle.
The co-accused threatened to cut off the victim’s fingers and when he went to look for knife the respondent held the victim.
In pre-sentence report he was considered high risk to reoffend.
[8] This court has often expressed its condemnation of these activities and in particular its condemnation of home invasion robberies and the robberies of highly vulnerable businesses.
The public must be protected from this type of criminal behaviour and more severe sentence is called for.
This sentence takes into account the time the respondent served both on remand and on electronic monitoring.
[2](1996), 1996 CanLII 4934 (SK CA), 137 Sask. R. 306.
[4](2000), 2000 SKCA 49 (CanLII), 189 Sask. R. 291.","The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently.
The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation.
The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence.
The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers.
The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims.
The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences.
HELD: Leave was granted.
The appeal was allowed.
The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring.
The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed.
The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public.
A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.
He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times.
He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","[38, 39, 0, 35, 3, 37, 4, 7, 34, 27, 10, 13, 9, 8]"

[1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears.
She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[1]
The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment.
There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold “change in circumstances” which could result in a variation of the order.

(b) there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the defence or any part thereof; or
He must disclose the nature of the defence or the issue to be tried with clarity through sufficient facts to indicate that it is bonafide defence or issue to be tried.
As well there is question as to her claim involving loss of valuable service as to whether or not the amount claimed is appropriate when the plaintiff stated in discovery that she was able to do some housework and did so.
[24] Thus, Court should be extremely cautious in approaching an award in this particular category in absence of significant medical evidence which would clearly establish this injury classification could be overcome.

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle.
The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","[98, 2, 1, 94, 100, 3, 5, 99, 89, 6, 9]"

[2] And further, that between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on Nicole Eger, contrary to provisions of the Criminal Code.
[3] Mr. Therrien, with the advice of counsel, elected to be tried in this Court and entered guilty pleas on August 10, 2011.
Pre-Sentence Report and Electronic Monitoring Assessment was ordered and sentencing was adjourned to November 9, 2011, and then to November 23, 2011.
Counsel advised at that time that there was significant divergence on some of the facts.
Mr. Therrien may well have started by feeling and rubbing the victims over their clothing when they were sitting on his knee.
As the victims got little older and Mr. Therrien little bolder, he went to feeling and rubbing the girls under their clothing, and kissing them hard on the mouth.
His penis became erect.
[52] believe Mr. Therrien, when he testified that he cannot remember these incidents.","The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault.
The victims were his granddaughters.
The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991.
A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts.
The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims.
HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years.
The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters.
The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim.
Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","[7, 6, 152, 8, 3, 145, 9, 146, 5, 147, 10]"
882,"[1] On September 8, 1999, black Lincoln Town Car was stopped by member of the R.C.M.Police on highway No. near Maple Creek, Saskatchewan; 28.3 pounds of marihuana was discovered in the trunk of the Lincoln.
The registered owner of the Lincoln Marcelle Daphne Brooks (""Brooks"") was in the front passenger seat.
Both individuals were charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking.
Brooks was found not guilty on both counts.
[6] ""Offence-related property"" is defined in s. 2:
Most applications would presumably arise under this category: commercial lessors of motor vehicles; family member permitting another family member to utilize motor vehicle with no knowledge whatever that it might become ""offence-related property"", etc.
[35] The third category encompasses someone in the position of Brooks: she was unable to apply pursuant to s. 19(3) because she was charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application.
[38] In view of the provisions available in the Act to obtain an order of relief from forfeiture, it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment of any person who may have an interest in the property sought to be forfeited. ","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act.
The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order.
The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln.
She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.
The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking.
The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed.
HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1).
The application for relief was dismissed.
1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20.
2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence.
3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence.
There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here).
The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary.
In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","[2, 6, 0, 16, 125, 124, 3, 132]"
883,"DECISION: February 10, 1995
COUNSEL: Peter Bryson Maureen Reid, for the Applicant Reinhold Endres, Q.C., for the Respondent
The Applicant, Cape Breton District School Board (the ""Cape Breton Board""), operates fifty‑five schools, providing public school education from Primary to Grade 12 for approximately eighteen thousand students.
or (ii) contains any undertaking or agreement that abridges or modifies any power or duty of the board.
Section 33(7)(d) of the Education Act provides board with the authority to lease facilities, without the Minister's approval or involvement.
omission to file the report was caused by inadvertence, misunderstanding, or, as suggested by counsel intentionally in order to avoid confrontation with the Minister, it has, in effect, required the Cape Breton Board to use funds that could have been available to meet other educational programs and services in order to pay these leases.
Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined, with the approval of the Governor in Council, that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation then the cost of such a lease is the responsibility of the Province.
The lease costs are to the same extent as would be the cost of supplying the building free of costs.
There shall be no costs.","The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs.
The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs.
For the respondent,
that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval.
Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.
Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","[61, 60, 63, 56, 1, 2, 3, 12, 46]"
884,"[1] This is an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act, S.N.S. 1989, c. 160 as amended, requiring the appellant father, Gilbert Roland Hill to pay maintenance for his son James Anthony Davis.
Mr. Hill maintains he was unaware of Ms. Davis’ pregnancy until 1996, when Ms. Davis brought an application for child maintenance for James under the Family Maintenance Act (now the Maintenance and Custody Act).
[4] In June 2000 James completed grade 12 at Millwood High School.
In January 2001, after working in temporary positions for months, James re‑enrolled in Grade 12 in order to improve his marks for university entrance.
Mr. Hill either did not know or did not believe James had re-enrolled in school in January.
[6] James abandoned his upgrading attempt and sought employment.
He was abusing drugs and alcohol which behaviour was of concern to both parents.
He was admitted to hospital, where he stayed until October 9th, 2001.
[32] Quantum of support is governed by the Child Maintenance Guidelines made under s. 55 of the Maintenance and Custody Act, supra.
[34] Mr. Hill further says the judge should have time-limited the payment of support tying it to specific time within which James should complete his education.
It is not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.
He did not err.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday.
He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity.
The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father.
The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program.
The father appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident.
There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","[5, 11, 146, 148, 8, 16, 20, 15, 9, 133, 0, 143]"

TRIAL DIVISION
All three of these cases were heard in March of 1989 and decision could come at any time.
The facts as to each applicants claim is set forth in each of their affidavits on file herein.
It can also be said that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is not retrospective or retroactive in its operation in the sense that it does not change the law that was in effect prior to its coming into force.
There can only be one answer to this question and that is the age discrimination was unconstitutional from the time Section 15 of the Charter came into effect.
Those rights existed from the moment that Section came into force and exist despite any legislation to the contrary that may have been in effect.
The fact is that basic rights existed and some people were deprived of them and that deprivation, if asserted, would require remedy.
Damages is another.
In determining an appropriate remedy, all the usual factors taken into account by court in constructing remedy, should be taken into account by the Human Rights Commission.
That is further supportive reason for my earlier indication that the proper forum for human rights complaints is the Human Rights Commission.

Dismissing the application,
that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission.
The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.
The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","[2, 239, 242, 247, 234, 9, 228, 246, 0, 238, 12, 219, 224]"

DEFENDANT BOUDREAU, J.:
Mr. Brookes was retained to incorporate company, ""Z Developments Limited"" (Z P) and to act as general legal counsel to and to the project.
The plaintiffs have also claimed Mr. Brookes was negligent in his written acknowledgement of this latter irrevocable letter of direction and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement.
Issues The plaintiffs have raised number of issues in their claims against Mr. Brookes and these can be summarized as follows:
a. Did Mr. Brookes negligently misrepresent his intentions to the plaintiffs in his March 11, 1987 written acknowledgement of the irrevocable direction dated March 9, 1987;
found as fact that Mr. Legge, of the Creditors' Committee, was fully aware of the continued existence of the irrevocable letters of direction to pay the accounts of Goguen, Dufferin and Colchester and that all of the documentation commencing with the January 8, 1987 minutes clearly indicated the fact that legal fees would be deducted from mortgage proceeds and may result in slight fluctuations in net proceeds from mortgage advances.
found that Mr. Legge 'clearly had such knowledge and that he clearly knew these documents continued to be in full force and effect on the basis of the meeting and conversation of March 13, 1987.
also find that it would have been his responsibility to bring them to Mr. Verheuvel and Mr. Casey's attention, the other two members of the creditors committee.
J. HALIFAX, Nova Scotia
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA
TRIAL DIVISION
DEFENDANT DECISION OF BOUDREAU,","The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds.
The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking.
The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project.
When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers.
At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction.
The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction.
Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors.
The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'.
One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction.
On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters.
With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.
Dismissing the action,
that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable.
Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it.
Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it.
The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project.
At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project; 
(2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;
 and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings.
The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members.
The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","[3, 0, 309, 17, 312, 315, 21, 291, 11, 8, 22, 311, 5, 295, 288]"
887,"[1] Although Gordon Joseph Fiddler was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin Tommy Fiddler, on November 3, 2017, the Court found him not guilty of second degree murder but guilty of manslaughter.
[3] This sentencing decision is with regard to both the manslaughter conviction pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and his guilty plea to possession of firearm while prohibited from doing so contrary to s. 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
[4] Since the Court’s November 3, 2017, decision both Crown and defence counsel have changed.
During the sentencing submissions the Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim Tommy Fiddler; two of his sisters and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12.

(a) Pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, that sample of bodily substances be taken from Gordon Fiddler that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis;
(d) Pursuant to s. 491 of the Criminal Code, the Cooey, Model 39, single-shot bolt-action rifle, bearing Serial No. CTO18886 seized in the investigation of this offence is forfeited to Her Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Attorney General directs; and","HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction.
A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm.
The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary.
The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor.
The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","[211, 9, 0, 5, 214, 11, 4]"

Arrears were reduced by $7,000.
When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation.
The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office.
1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances.
2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance.

3. THAT shortly after midnight disturbance occurred between some patrons at the Last Straw Brew Pub and the staff members attempted to escort the unruly persons outside.

second was that the defendants had ceased to actively defend the action before trial, did not attend the trial, and were not served with notice of claim for punitive damages.
The most important issue concerning the sufficiency of pleadings remains whether the defendant is informed of the case to be met and is not unfairly taken by surprise.

It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000.
Rule 343A contemplates amendment of the judgment in these circumstances, and, furthermore, the jurisprudence is clear that the court possesses an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected.
Friesen et al. v. Saskatchewan Mortgage and Trust Corporation Limited et al., 1926 CanLII 148 (SK CA), [1926]
[24] The Executions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. E-12 provides (in s. 30) that every judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of five percent per annum from the time of entering the judgment until the judgment is satisfied.
W.W.R. 469, 147 Sask. R. 161 (Q.B.), the Court held that the debt created by judgment is debt due and payable as of the date of pronouncement and that collection proceedings may be properly taken before formal judgment is entered.
This general principle is applicable here.
[25] Therefore, order that the respondent pay to the applicant post-judgment interest at rate of five percent per annum from the date judgment was pronounced, being March 19, 1999, in accordance with s. 30 of The Executions Act, and until judgment is satisfied.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs.
At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs.
The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs.
Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties.
Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial.
The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000.
The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial.
The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate.
The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers.
HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case.
The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure.
The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance.
In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate.
Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances.
The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous.
The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs.
The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","[2, 0, 80, 73, 77, 9, 76, 8]"

Appeal File: 1725
Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff
SHERSTOBITOFF J.A.
This appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow.
Mrs. Verma commenced her action for division of matrimonial property on May 1, 1985 and Dr. Verma petitioned for divorce in 1988.
It might be added that the quotation from Zimmerman relied on by the trial judge, and quoted above, itself says that settlement should not be enforced by the court if it is ""obviously incomplete"".
The judgments in Zimmerman and in number of Queen's Bench judgments which have followed it have taken their authority to enforce settlements reached during pre-trial conferences from Queen's Bench Rule 184A. That Rule is contained in Part Fourteen of the Queen's Bench Rules, Offer To Settle, which contemplates formal written offer to settle to be served on the other party (Rule 181), and formal written acceptance to be served on the other party (Rule 183), and means of enforcing offers made and accepted under the Rules 181 and 183 (Rule 184A).
In the cases of negotiated settlements, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs.

HELD: Appeal allowed.
 1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988]
1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings.
The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences.
2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded.
Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.
 3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear.
Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","[70, 68, 1, 2, 64, 6, 0, 65, 12, 62, 7, 60]"

[4] The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non conveniens, and at the same time the applicants have not provided lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether there were any witnesses and where they may be resident; police whether report was filed; whether anybody investigated the accident; whether any of them are witnesses; whether there are police reports; whether the plaintiff was seen by doctors and, if so, where they are located and whether they might be called to testify at trial.
Third, the factors to be considered by the Court in making that determination are set out in case law, two of which have been referred to me are O’Brien vs.

The Court Nothing.
am going to grant the applicant some costs even though it has been unsuccessful on the question of forum non conveniens because, in different sense, the applicants have not been successful in getting what they want.
am going to keep those costs relatively low.

The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens.
In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

[1] The question in this case is whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given.
[4] Thinking the assessment had been made in error, the company decided to appeal to the board of revision.
The administrator picked it up on the following Monday, and then wrote Wascana Energy, informing the company that its appeal would not be entertained by the board of revision because of the late receipt of the notice of appeal.
51]. In support of this proposition we referred to Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v. Langridge; [1991]
[33] Since the legislature said nothing of the possible effects of timely posting but untimely receipt of subsection 303(1) notice of appeal given by means of registered mail, the matter is one of implication, having regard for the considerations mentioned in Newell Smelski.
And so the appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed, with costs as usual, and there will be an order directing the board of revision to hear and determine the company's assessment appeal.","At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given.
The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period.
The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday.
The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal.

He moved for stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure.
[35] If jury is deemed capable of assimilating proper instructions regarding evidence of prior convictions, one must assume that trial judges fully comprehend those instructions.
[36] The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced.
standard of perfection would then be required of the Crown, standard which humans are quite incapable of achieving.
[37] Every individual charged with criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.
[7] In this case, when the matter was raised with the trial judge, she said that she had not read the record, that she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings, and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.
In these circumstances she was correct to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recuse herself.
[8] The appeal is allowed, the order for prohibition is quashed, and the matter is remitted to the Provincial Court for trial.","The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure.
In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.
The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her.
The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial.
There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.
The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point.
The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.
She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","[0, 4, 52, 2, 3, 58, 57, 51, 49, 8, 48, 56]"

Accordingly, pursuant to s. 198(3)(b), the court finds that in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) Sawkiw\'s income replacement benefits are properly terminated effective the first day of his employment in Alberta.
However, for reasons previously stated, for the period September 24, 1997 to the date of termination pursuant to s. 129(1)(e) the court finds that Sawkiw was entitled to be paid a full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver.
He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties.
HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g).
SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances.
SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time.
It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting.
It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations.
He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit.
2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta.
However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.
Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment.
3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith.
If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a).
Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.
He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","[425, 18, 9, 13, 6, 423, 3, 422, 421, 20, 405, 17, 414, 408, 420, 393, 2, 417, 394]"
897,"[1] The issues herein centre around claim by John George Len (the “plaintiff”) against the Woodlawn Regional Park Authority (the “defendant”) for unpaid holiday pay.
The plaintiff bases his entitlement to holiday pay on the provisions of The Labour Standards Act, R.S.S. 1978 c. L-1 (the “LSA”).
[5] The plaintiff was hired by the defendant on April 29, 1988 as the superintendent of the Woodlawn Regional Park (the “Park”).
[7] For the first few months after he was hired by the defendant, the plaintiff worked with the previous superintendent learning the job.
The plaintiff was paid by the hour, at the rate of $8.00 per hour.
The plaintiff proposed that he work 30 hours per week over the winter of 1988-1989.
[54] The plaintiff also claims holiday pay on the notice period damages awarded by the jury.
The plaintiff claims therefore that he should be entitled to holiday pay on this notice period of 18 months.
Unless the plaintiff demonstrates an actual loss occasioned by the loss of vacation entitlement, or evidence that he was entitled to take pay in lieu of the vacation, there should be no compensation for same and the plaintiff’s claim in that regard is not allowed.
[56] For the reasons stated, the plaintiff’s claim for holiday pay is dismissed with costs.","A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice.
The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs.
The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay.
HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.
 1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays.
The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA.
Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement.
Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date.
Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose.
4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax.
As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.
 5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year.
The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.
 6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus.
The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor.
The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent.
Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period.
The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose.
It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA.
Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime.
Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime.
The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","[366, 24, 363, 20, 345, 13, 0, 5, 19, 347]"

ADDENDUM HRABINSKY J.","The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer.
They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code.
The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial.
At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter.
The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter.
HELD: Application allowed in part.
 1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society.
While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective.
S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused.
They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence.
The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true.
S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid.

Pursuant to s. 117 of the Act, and s. 24 of The Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, c.A-35, Reg. (the “Regulations”), found that Montgrand’s IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident, as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act.
Therefore, the 180 day income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) ""is designed to be measured is that of 'weighted average' calculation.""
All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident.
The further deductions to obtain the non-earner’s IRB is in keeping with his earning reality.
16) Counsel for Montgrand also appealed SGI’s calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgment interest.

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75.
The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act.
HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.
It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners.
All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident.

[9] The amendment will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed.

Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time.

He was ultimately released from detention in 2004 on the strength of $5,000 cash and surety bond.
[25] The risk of non-appearance is further heightened, in Romania’s submission, by the fact Mr. Cretu has now been committed for extradition.

Unfortunately, this is not solution to the problem.
The third party's liability, if any, to the applicant will have to be determined on case by case basis.

The applicant shall have its costs of the application, to be taxed, against the plaintiff and the proposed third party.","The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible.
The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed.

(b) it would be otherwise unjust to decide the issues on the motion, whereupon the judge shall order summary trial, or the trial of specified issue or issues.
[24] The remarks of McRuer, C.J.H.C. in Bardal v. The Globe and Mail Ltd., 1960 CanLII 294 (ON SC), [1960]
[25] In the case of a person in the plaintiff’s position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-management one.
The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary.
Plaintiff’s counsel put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of seven months.
[28] The plaintiff is entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause.
The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager.
When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff.
It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination.
There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay.
The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court.
HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment.
Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b).
The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so.
If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact.
The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons.
The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer.
The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function.
'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace.
The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'.
The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings.
3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.
 4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","[3, 135, 4, 132, 0, 131, 5, 129, 125]"

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls.
HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry.
The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem.
The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society.
For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles.
The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images.
The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world.
Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same.
2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.
A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence.
Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","[5, 9, 282, 280, 291, 293, 19, 286, 20, 287, 17, 18, 13, 285, 0, 265, 277, 33, 1, 4, 264, 283, 288, 16, 279, 270, 252]"

Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code.
The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent’s first drug offence and she had no record of violence.
With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order.
The error lay in the judge’s failure to have regard for the offender’s record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs (2001), 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON CA), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.).

911,"[1] Todd Tyndall is charged with driving without due care and attention at Yorkton, Saskatchewan on February 18, 2004, contrary to section 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
This offence is in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code.
[2] At trial, the Crown called three witnesses: Rebecca Banga, Justin Banga and Lance Kuchar.
The standard to be applied was set out by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench in R. v. Kozun 1997 CanLII 11313 (SK QB), [1997]
Corporal Pelzer also said he could find no sign of damage to the front end of this vehicle at the point where contact was made with Mr. Kuchar.
also accept that neither seat belt, belonging to Mr. Tyndall or Mr. Rostotski, locked upon striking Mr. Kuchar, and that this vehicle did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking him.
Viewed objectively, and before considering any explanation from and on behalf of Mr. Tynadall, am satisfied that this driving was careless.
[26] In conclusion, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that, given the situation Mr. Tyndall found himself in, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him, and further that Mr. Tyndall did exercise due diligence both before and after striking Mr. Kachur.","The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian.

912,"Between: Her Majesty the Queen
Heard: January 31, 2008, in Barrington, Nova Scotia
By the Court:
[2] The Crown argues that because Mr. Goreham was driving motor vehicle on highway and his “driver’s license” was revoked he is guilty of the offence.
He was dealing with section 230(1) and the phrase “motor vehicle registered or required to be registered under this Act.”
[9] Justice LeBlanc’s intention to not exempt ATV’s from all references to “motor vehicles” in the Act became clear when he said at paragraph 37:
At paragraph of that decision Hall J. said:
In s.287(2) the words “motor vehicle” include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain license to drive it on the highway.
[11] In this case Mr. Goreham could not have obtained a license to drive an ATV on the highway because it was a prohibited vehicle.
It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license.
Mr. Goreham is, therefore, not guilty of driving a motor vehicle while his license was revoked and the charge under s. 287(2) is dismissed.
In fact, he would certainly have been guilty of driving prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11, but that is not the charge before the court.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway.
Accused found not guilty;
the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle.

Between: Wallace Fox
Defendants J. Ron Cherkewich For the Plaintiff
JUDGMENT S. D. LOEWEN,
[31] Paragraph 57.13 is asking for “Section 24 Charter damages.”
It does not stipulate with any precision what damages have been suffered, nor establish any sort of quantum for those damages.
copy of the contract referenced by Mr. Cherkewich was filed by him at the argument of this matter.
In that regard, note that neither Wallace Fox nor any of the other proposed Defendants were signatories to that agreement.
[36] In summary, then, given that virtually all the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court, I will decline to issue the summonses as requested.
[37] In addition, there is no claim being advanced against any potential Defendant other than the Government of Saskatchewan.
[38] Further, insofar as the potential claims attempt to address contractual issues, there is no privity of contract between any of the claimants and the Government of Saskatchewan, let alone the other named Defendants.
[39] Section 7(4) of The Small Claims Act contemplates decision such as the present one.
The claimants in this case are therefore free to pursue their action in that Court as they might wish.","The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals.
The issue was whether the claims should be issued.
HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued.
In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function.
Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case.
The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief.
A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract.
Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement.
As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court.
Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","[232, 234, 229, 5, 231, 1, 222, 9, 215, 223, 0, 216, 226]"
914,"[1] This is an application wherein the respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support.

There are three children who live with the petitioner.
They are the following:
Mark Andrew born May 28, 1986 (12)
Any payment order will not impact upon that.
It was suggested that because of his mental disability he could live in group home and the cost would be relatively low.
The actual amount is $210.00 which is 33 per cent of his present income of $630.00.
[16] In this regard, simply say that there is no requirement that the respondent live in group home and there is no basis upon which can order or even expect such.
The latter can be achieved by providing to the respondent some of the income earned from his land.
Conclusion [18] In the result, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent the annual sum of $6,000.00, which shall be paid in monthly installments of $500.00 commencing April 1, 1999.
The respondent will have his costs of this application in any event of the cause, which costs fix at $400.00.","The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support.
The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996.
The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed.
In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind.
He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month.
The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home.
The petitioner and children live in that home.
The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.
The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income.
The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month.
HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500.
There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage.
In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.
Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","[86, 0, 1, 85, 7, 80, 84, 77, 3, 4, 79, 74]"

The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson
On November 19, 1993, McLeod was involved in a motor vehicle accident.
McLeod, Kellogg and McLeod's wife were sued as result of the accident.
Royal denied coverage and refused to defend the action in the name and on behalf of the insured on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy.
199 Every contract evidenced by motor vehicle liability policy shall provide that, where person insured by the contract is involved in an accident resulting from the ownership, use or operation of an automobile in respect of which insurance is provided under the contract and resulting in loss or damage to persons or property, the insurer shall:
There is nothing irrational which arises from the assumption the first reference to Insured refers to both Kellogg and McLeod.
am not prepared to accept that this policy should be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as temporary substitute should be ignored.
Before concluding, add that am largely in agreement with the view of this matter taken by the chamber judge.
Having done that, it seems useful to add my views as expressed in this judgment.
WAKELING J.A.
concur JACKSON J.A.","Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg.
Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage.
Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident.
Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles.
It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate.
HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy.
Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend.
Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify.
When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in.
The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'.
To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy.
The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision.
He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit.
CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.
 1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.
To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to.
There were inconsistencies in terminology.
The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","[346, 4, 345, 6, 340, 342, 324, 13, 339, 11, 1, 14, 23]"

[3] Mr. Stets received global sentence of $1,000 fine plus 18-months’ probation.
[51] The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction must also be dismissed.
With regard to the dangerous driving offence, should driving prohibition have been imposed as part of the sentence?
(a) an error in principle, failure to consider relevant sentencing factor or an erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor will justify appellate intervention only when the trial judge's decision in that regard had an impact on the sentence (at para 44)
74 In the end, therefore, Lacasse indicates that an appellate court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for the one imposed by trial level court in only two circumstances.
The first is when the sentence imposed by the trial level court is demonstrably unfit.
[56] Since no error has been identified, or for that matter is apparent from the record, there is no basis to intervene with the sentence imposed.","HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed.
The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it.
Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account.
The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial.
There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.
The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling.
On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse.
She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver.
The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider.
It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","[228, 4, 8, 235, 11, 229, 9, 223, 216, 214]"

The amount of the bonus was left blank.
The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year.
HELD: The claim is dismissed.
In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable.
This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to.
The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did.
The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus.
The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","[56, 4, 50, 55, 5, 0, 54, 9, 12, 10, 45, 49, 13, 19, 41]"

Counsel: Martin J. Pink, Q.C., for the Applicant
It is for the purpose of entry of the Respondent’s name in the Child Abuse Register.
[22] The Complainant gave specific detailed evidence of sexual relations with the Respondent all of which is denied by him.
This fact came to her mother’s attention and he was told not to do this.
He told her this had to stop but there is no evidence that this was reported by him to her mother.
This would have been the most reasonable and logical thing to do.
[29] The Court finds that the accused has abused a child within the meaning of Section 62(b) of the Children and Family Services Act.
John D. Comeau
of Nova Scotia","The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register.
The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16.
The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court.
The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act.
Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications.
However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","[97, 86, 2, 90, 94, 95, 0, 91, 13, 79, 8, 5, 9, 1]"
920,"[3] In February of 2013, the defendant informed the family that the children’s provisional approval to attend École de Bellegarde would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year.
On September 10, 2013, the defendant applied to strike out the statement of claim.
This decision provides the court’s reasons for decision on both applications.

(a) whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or
At that point, the CÉF may admit the children on permanent basis or renew the provisional permission.
Also, the courts do not usually watch over or supervise performance.
decree for specific performance does involve substantially higher risk that further judicial resources will be required.
The cost to society of providing the resources necessary to implement specific performance decrees is properly considered by the court when weighing the advantages the specific relief might otherwise offer.
2. The plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant has violated ss. 23.2(1) of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 is struck out.
4. The CÉF’s application for an order striking out the claim for damages arising from alleged “intentional infliction of emotional and mental suffering” on Trystan Lawless is dismissed;
[96] The hearing of this application and the material filed in support was in both French and English.","Civil Procedure Injunction
HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal.
While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted.
Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code.
With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog.
That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit.
The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable.
Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed.
The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","[485, 487, 10, 479, 13, 482, 488, 6, 34, 20, 471, 21]"

c. An order of mandamus directing the development officer to issue the final approval.
[2] The facts are neither complicated nor in dispute.
The Applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in October of 1997 and received the same on March 16, 1998.
2. one of the bearings on the plan was missing.
[4] While the missing bearing on the plan was and is of no great consequence, the requirement to meet the new road standard represented major obstacle for the Applicant.
[22] Furthermore under the Municipal Government Act, the Applicant’s right to appeal is limited.
[24] Furthermore, subsection 251(2) limits the Board’s jurisdiction on appeal.
[25] Thus even if the Board were to hear this matter by way of appeal, it might not have been able to grant appropriate relief.
It has been said that the court on review will weigh the character and competence of the alternative remedy to ascertain if it is sufficient and convenient in the true legal sense of these words.
See R. v. Minister of Finance, 1934 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1935], S.C.R. 70, at 86.
Specifically, I direct the development officer to issue the final approval (subject only to the Applicant correcting the technical error in the plan).
Michael MacDonald
Associate Chief Justice","The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval.
In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications.
The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus.
Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan).
The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness.
The development officer misinterpreted the legislation.
Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval.
There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate.
The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.
Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","[8, 118, 114, 124, 123, 122, 12, 1, 111, 107, 119, 9, 17, 18]"

am also aware that s. 308 of The Cities Act may be an absolute defence to the City.
However as stated by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in MacPherson Engineering Inc., supra, the application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it.
[13] Therefore the application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party is granted as requested.","SGI applied on behalf of the defendant for an order under Queen's Bench Rule 107A(c) and s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act for leave to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to the action.
The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon.
The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit.
The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of.
HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted.
The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party.
There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.
There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

INTRODUCTION
[1] This is an application by the accused, Wendell Willick, for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
The indictment was amended on July 27, 2007, by consent, to read ""153(1)(a)"" rather than ""153(a)"".

alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be

inadvertent and admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into","This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.
Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2).
The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
HELD: The evidence is admissible.
The accused's application is dismissed.
1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant.
The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship.
The conversation is logically probative to the charge.
2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.
The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations.
3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained.
The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization.
The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered.
Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.
During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.
The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence.
Therefore, there is no Charter breach.
4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence.
Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion.
In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship.
There is no evidence of bad faith.
There is no evidence of manipulation.
The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[301, 298, 313, 10, 302, 3, 11, 297, 306, 12, 305, 7, 17, 287, 13, 296, 290, 18, 284, 16]"
925,"1) After enduring what can best be described as tumultuous relationship spanning some five and one-half years, the parties permanently separated.
They never married.
Now, Lawrence is seeking access to Melodie’s daughter from an earlier relationship.
At the time Melodie was still living with Trista’s father Greg.
She left him in January, 2001, living temporarily with friends before moving to her own apartment.
Trista was just over two years old.
He met her within week of starting to date Melodie.
The arrival for access of Melodie’s older daughters, Trista’s half-sisters, only added to the chaos and mayhem in the home.
37) This being the environment in which Trista lived for several of her formative years, it is somewhat surprising that she is now doing as well in school as was described by Ms. Gabriel.
This coincided with the final departure of Lawrence from Trista’s family dynamic and the introduction by Melodie of Trista’s third “dad”.
The father of these two children is intermittently involved in their lives.
The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what “family” means.
However, in the circumstances of this cases, there will be no order for costs.","The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married.
The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship.
The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to.
There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children.
The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997.
HELD: The application for access is dismissed.
In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child.
The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life.
The community viewed them generally as father and daughter.
However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her.
This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.
The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.
Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","[1, 0, 235, 2, 7, 6, 15, 239, 228, 10, 223, 244, 224]"

At 8:29:10, Coutu takes the cup out of the microwave and walks over to one of the four tables where the first victim, inmate Murray Dorion (“Dorion”), is sitting, apparently doing nothing.
Coutu throws hot liquid on Dorion’s face and body and then begins to stab him repeatedly.
Knife turns his attention away from Dorion, at which time an altercation occurs as between Knife and Dreaver versus Demeria.
(a) to prevent the commission of an offence
[88] In this case, Demeria obviously came to the aid of an individual who was being stabbed repeatedly.
Consequently, I find that Demeria was clothed in legal justification when he entered the fray.
[89] As result, find that all of the elements of the common assault offence have also been made out by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt.
Conclusion [90] In the final analysis, I find that the Crown has made out all of the elements of both counts beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, find Frederick Junior Knife guilty of both Count 1 and Count 2 as specified in the indictment.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary.
The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon.
second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant.
The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured.
The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant.
None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused.
The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day.
The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code.
HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts.
1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances.
Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate.
Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option.
The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them.
2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge.
Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.
The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","[360, 366, 341, 356, 362, 5, 337, 11, 367, 12]"
927,"COUNSEL: Jonathan C.K. Stobie, Esq., for the Plaintiff
D. Kevin Latimer, Esq., for the Defendant
Were time available, my preference would have been to give written reasons which would have been more elaborate than these.
glean the following summary of the facts from the pleadings.
The plaintiff has claimed, first, return of its Eight Thousand Dollar ($8,000.00) ""deposit""; second, declaration that the Letter Arrangement does not constitute an enforceable contract; third, if it does, that the plaintiff is not liable under the contract to the defendant, and fourth, if the plaintiff is liable, then only to the extent of liability determined by this court.
On the contrary, Justice Hallett in writing for the Court of Appeal, determined that there was sound evidentiary basis for the chambers judge to have come to that conclusion.
To illustrate, will refer to at least six such references by Justice Hallett.
""She...""(referring to Justice Bateman)""found that the respondent did not appreciate the consequences of not defending; the respondent's testimony supports this finding.
She also found that he understood an adequate response could be made in Ontario; the respondent's testimony supports this finding.""
For all of these reasons then, the defendant\'s application is dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).
It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to consider the plaintiff's subsidiary request for directions, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 25, nor the issue of appropriate forum.","The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued.
Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs.
The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence.
Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff,
that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant.
Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","[1, 0, 180, 181, 175, 5, 173, 2, 168, 161, 12]"

The delay was not unreasonable.

Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest.
The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay.

[1] This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA], in relation to motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank.
It also requires review of these decisions to ascertain whether or not the conclusion reached in Andrew (CA) is contrary to that reached in Hrynewich Holdings.
[3] The appellants granted residential mortgage in favour of the respondent on January 10, 2011, securing loan in the amount of $460,800.00.
The remaining $87,711.00 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent.
The appellants fell into default and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings.
The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent.
The purchase money debt balance is decreased to $132,582.48 and is protected by s. of the LCRA.
[36] The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment.

Jackson J.A.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800.
The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land.
The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent.
The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186.
The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent.
As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.
The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99.
The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was.
HELD: The appeal was allowed.
The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA.
It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal.
Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","[183, 182, 5, 4, 8, 13, 12, 168, 173, 176, 15, 9, 177, 0]"

am satisfied on the evidence of the accused that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample.
He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer.
Hence, it is reasonably possible that the reason there was no adequate sample was that there was no adequate instruction as to how to provide the sample.

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused.
The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance.
The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample.
There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.","[0, 75, 1, 10, 5, 6, 80, 74, 81, 83, 72, 11, 13]"

Respondent REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: Clarke, C.J.N.S. (Orally)","This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning.
The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals.
Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook.
Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.

Further, to give definitive answers to broad ranging questions concerning the interpretation of provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, S.N.S. 1994-95, c. 10, could stifle the incremental development of jurisprudence with respect to claims under that Act.

The plaintiff applies to strike the statement of defence of the individual defendant, Louis Dion, on the same grounds.
Until it was too late for the plaintiff to do anything about it, the defendants' counsel did nothing to dispel those reasonable assumptions.
Here the defendants have consistently attempted to improperly thwart at every turn the efforts of the plaintiff to determine the matters raised in these lawsuits.
accordingly order as follows: (1)The corporate defendant shall, within days of the date of this order, provide the plaintiff's solicitors with written notice of the person who it proposes is the proper officer to be examined on its behalf.

Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution.
Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend.
The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer.
This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants.
The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors.
HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply.
He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates.

EMPLOYEES, LOCAL Respondent","The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996.
The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year.
Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries.
In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze.
After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act.
The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation.
The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
The employer appealed.
Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue.
Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration.

HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.
 2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old.
The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year.
The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes.
Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines.
The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon.
The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children.
One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children.
4)Spousal support was not ordered.
The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future.
Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same.
5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal.
Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000.
There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops.

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor.
The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.
The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid.
Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000.
Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents.
The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages.
Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.
In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","[2, 3, 1024, 1025, 10, 1026, 982, 972, 49, 4, 41, 990, 51, 995, 1023, 45, 42, 37, 56, 38, 50, 32]"

There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months).
The mother had nothing positive to say about him.
They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child.
He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access.
The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country.
Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access.
The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs.
There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy.
There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk.
Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so.
While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","[203, 10, 198, 14, 16, 15, 194, 17, 6, 186, 204, 187]"

It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an accomplice, and the evidence of a person who has provided inconsistent testimony, what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act.
She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown.
The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B.
HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents.
It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept.
1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established.
When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established.
The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability.
When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable.
2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","[10, 4, 8, 7, 17, 475, 465, 28, 5, 451, 472, 448, 20, 463, 41, 468, 40, 480, 18, 469, 471, 455, 481, 456, 486, 457, 37, 50, 439, 489]"

The trial decision is reported at (1998), 1998 CanLII 3563 (NS SC), 171 N.S.R. (2d) 360.
[2] Ms. Bureau is 40-year-old quality assurance consultant specializing in the ISO quality registration system.
In the first full year of operation, 1995, her net income from that business was approximately $113,000 on gross billings of $195,000.
[3] KPMG decided to establish quality assurance practice in Halifax.
[4] In series of meetings Ms. Bureau and Mr. Travers discussed her possible employment with KPMG.
The relevant circumstances are recited in considerable detail in the trial judge’s decision.
[7] The appellant identifies the following issues:
(iii) If the answer to either or both of these questions is yes, how are damages to be calculated?
Court of Appeal is clearly not entitled to interfere merely because it takes different view of the evidence.
On the damages for wrongful dismissal he said (at p.372):
The final termination notice and dismissal came very swiftly and in somewhat peremptory fashion.
One month was paid on termination leaving balance of four months outstanding.
The obligation was upon Ms. Bureau to take all reasonable steps to mitigate.","The respondent was recruited by the respondents.
Her job was to start quality assurance practice.
She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so.
After 15 months she was dismissed.
The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal.
The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal.
The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate.
Appeal and cross-appeal,
that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","[2, 0, 291, 288, 9, 13, 3, 19, 22, 295, 287, 6, 33, 5]"

The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet.
If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars.
If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state.

The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.
 3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.
The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.
 4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion.
The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5)

945,"[1] At issue in this appeal is the ownership of monies in joint bank account in the names of the late Elizabeth Scott and Jeanne Akerley.
At Mrs. Scott’s passing, over $50,000 was held on deposit in that account.
The appellant, Frank Comeau, and the respondents, Ms. Akerley and Rachel Gregoire, are children of the deceased.
Ms. Gregoire serves as adminstratrix of the estate of her late mother.
All parties were self-represented on the appeal.
[3] The late Mrs. Scott’s situation and her family were summarized by Justice Roscoe in that earlier decision as follows:
[2] Elizabeth Scott, 90 year old widow, died without will on June 15, 2002.
[21] would however agree with the appellant that the issue of the joint bank accounts was not properly handled by the Probate Court and that further investigation into their ownership is required.
[16] The hearing in probate court was neither lengthy nor complex.
In summary, see no grounds for appellate intervention in his decision regarding ownership of the joint account.
By not addressing this matter, the probate court judge did not err.
[18] I would dismiss the appeal, and order the appellant to pay costs of $500 to Ms. Gregoire.
If she wishes, the administratrix may apply the $500 the appellant was to receive there against the costs he is here ordered to pay Ms. Gregoire.","At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter.
Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.
 It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate.
Another of the deceased's children appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","[81, 85, 84, 0, 87, 1, 8, 4, 74, 2, 9, 3, 16]"

The cases referred to, however, involved simply the
construction of the statute and the regulations under it, as

As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful that it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme.
It is, of course, entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims and these may well have come to the attention of the solicitors in this case, but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the applicant corporation exists.

The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause.
1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff.
This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.
 2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern.
4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme.

DECISION S. C. CARTER,
[1] The accused, Craig Lawrence Kendall Weenie, is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
[2] From the evidence heard at the trial on June 12, 2008, make the following finding of the facts.
The accused then began to walk towards Cst. Hayes.
No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused.
The Crown’s position is that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go, rather than banging on the door of that particular apartment.
In my view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act, should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.
DECISION: [12] The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.
The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention.
The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public.
HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act.
There was a complaint to police concerning the accused.
He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment.
He smelled of alcohol.
He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police.
Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol.
He was causing a disturbance to others.
Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place.
No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused.
The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication.
The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go.
In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest.
There was no such person in this case.

[2] After carefully considering the record and counsels’ submissions we are unanimously of the opinion that the appeal ought to be dismissed.
She knew that if she were convicted, her parole would be revoked.
Ms. Ogden said she was using crack cocaine at the time and bouncing around from friend to friend for place to sleep.
The appellant said she didn’t really know what to do at that point because Mr. LeBlanc was “out cold” on the floor.
She crouched over him and lifted his head to see that he was okay.
She ran. She denied ever seeing his wallet, robbing or strangling Mr. LeBlanc, or being part of plan to rob him.
[10] Justice Bryson’s oral decision was rendered shortly after hearing the evidence and detailed submissions from counsel.
We see no error in his conclusion that the appellant’s culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond reasonable doubt.
[12] For all of these reasons we would dismiss the appeal.
Concurred in:","The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom.
A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out.
When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him.
She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back.
The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat.
Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door.
Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay.
When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked.
She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest.
Appeal dismissed;
 it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility.
Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence.
The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","[64, 1, 69, 6, 71, 70, 61, 11, 60, 63, 7, 55, 56, 14, 15, 12, 24]"

BETWEEN: CORNELIUS GERARDUS MOOY
COUNSEL: Steven G. Zatzman, Esq.,
Counsel for the Respondent.
BETWEEN: JOSEPHINE JUNE MOOY
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT BY: JONES, J.A.","This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards.
The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children.
Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home.
The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties.
The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal.
The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final.
Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order,
that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected.
There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision.
The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases.
To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties.
Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period.
The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period.
Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","[258, 2, 256, 4, 260, 11, 21, 253, 15, 7, 248, 5, 27, 12, 244, 20, 239]"

The appeal is dismissed.","The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets.
The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman.
The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue.
The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food.
The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence.
The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence.
Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge.
The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status.
HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed.
The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial.
The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing.
2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone).
The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in.
3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed.
The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet).
4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food.
5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement.
Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable.
The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary.
6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument.
7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","[1, 0, 1377, 1412, 1415, 31, 1375, 41, 13, 66, 5, 40, 1410, 25, 30, 1382, 1329, 95, 96, 26, 1416, 1299, 1379, 1419, 1417, 19, 1288, 1384, 1327]"

Each plaintiff had an investment account with RBC.
[3] The plaintiffs say they dealt with Mr. O’Neill, who is no longer employed by RBC.
They say RBC failed to properly supervise Mr. O’Neill, and breached its duty of care and the applicable contracts.
It denies the existence of fiduciary relationship between itself (or Mr. O’Neill) and the plaintiffs.
The parties have voluntarily participated in case management conferences, the first held by Davison, J. on June 29, 2000, and the second on March 1, 2001, at which time the parties agreed that discoveries of the named parties would be held by July 31, 2001.
In fact, arrangements for discovery examinations of the parties and some of the plaintiff's experts were initially scheduled for July, 2001, in Ottawa and in London, Ontario.
[74] On balance, in view of the drastic nature of the dismissal remedy and the divided responsibility for the cumulative delay, I believe that the balance weighs in favour of preserving the proceeding.
In any event, the balancing analysis would lead to the conclusion that the proceeding should be preserved.","The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice.
These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant.
The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years.
The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars.
There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest).
The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim.
Application dismissed.
While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years).
While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant.
There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay.
After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here.
On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice.
There is a significant documentary record of the transactions.
The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner.
The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time.
While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice.
Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","[419, 13, 0, 9, 412, 421, 411, 7, 18, 22]"
953,"[1] Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I are not convinced Madam Justice Hunter erred in concluding that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska was ""patently unreasonable"":
Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, 1993 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1993]
[3] Nor can we find any material error in the remainder of her analysis, including that concerned with the phrase ""pursuant to Article 28 ... or 26 ... as the case may be,"" appearing in Article 16.
[19] consideration of the issue immediately raises these questions: Is it ""clearly irrational"" (to use Cory J's phrase) for the parties to collective agreement to provide right to severance allowance to every employee whose position is eliminated as result of technological change through reorganization or otherwise (Article 16) and then to limit that right by giving the employer the right to provide the employee with alternative employment and failing that by giving the employee an option to exercise his right to severance allowance or be laid-off subject to recall (Article 28)?
In my respectful view the answer to both questions is an unequivocal ""no"".
In my respectful view such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.
[21] It is for these reasons that would allow the appeal and restore the arbitrators' majority award.
[22] In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs on the usual scale.","The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions.
She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable.
Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'.
Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review.
DISSENT:
The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky.
The Chambers judge did not follow that approach.
Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears.
The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear.
The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.
Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","[101, 102, 100, 0, 1, 97, 8, 95]"
954,"By: The Honourable Madam Justice Smith
The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane
Following subdivision of the land, title to the newly created surface parcel was registered in the name of Mainline on January 18, 2002.
This second mortgage secured the same monies advanced by FCC to Mainline as was secured by its leasehold mortgage.
That of the respondent, by its terms, was expressly limited to charge upon “my equity”.
Stated at its highest, the respondent’s position after registration of the caveat could only be the same as if the equitable mortgage itself could have been and had been registered as an instrument under the Act.
For these reasons, therefore, do not agree that, by virtue of the filing of its caveat, the respondent obtained, under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, priority over the prior equitable interest of the appellant.
We do not have to decide this issue, as no third party interest was created or is before us.
[24] In other respects, however, and as between the immediate parties to these transactions, the situations are equivalent.
[25] For these reasons, we concur in the trial judge’s conclusion that the fee simple mortgage of the respondent has priority over the fee simple mortgage of the appellant.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent.","This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC.
The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC.
The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act.
HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.
 1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2)
Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered.
In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties.
This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000.
In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000.
The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent.
Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC.
The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","[2, 155, 0, 145, 15, 10, 150, 143, 156, 139, 149]"

About week after the conclusion of the trial, but before rendered my decision the petitioner revoked his offer.
[2] have compared the offer of settlement to my decision.
The petitioner had offered to waive any spousal support but after trial ordered retroactive spousal support in the amount of $18,000.00.
[3] The purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court is obvious.
This Rule calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer.
[4] The wrinkle here is that the petitioner’s offer was revoked.
However it was revoked week after the conclusion of the trial.
Obviously if it had been accepted when tendered there would not have been trial with the attendant costs of running the trial.
That is the intent in my opinion of Rule 184B and shall implement the Rule.
[7] The combination of Rule 184B and Rule 545 lead myself to the following conclusion.
I order that the petitioner shall have party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010.
Since these matters have now been concluded all costs of course are payable forthwith.","Supplementary reasons to 2010 SKQB 439.
The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010.
The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial.
A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked.
The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B.
HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer.
The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction.

The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him.
The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years.

Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents).
Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern.
The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place).
There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff.

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form.
The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant.
The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate.
The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

[1] The appellant landlord appeals a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer on the following two questions of law:
[2] The tenancy commenced on April 1, 2012.
The effect of s. 8(2) of the Act quoted above, reverses this onus and places the same on the person claiming the loss.
It was therefore the appellant who had the obligation to show that he did whatever was reasonable to minimize his loss.
[10] While the appellant gave evidence before the hearing officer that September was difficult time to rent the premise in question, the fact is he did not try, because he had decided it would be better going forward to have furnished premise for rent.
In the absence of any evidence the hearing officer was not in position to guess whether the premises would have been leased within six weeks or not, and if so whether it would have been leased at the same rent.
[11] The appeal is allowed with respect to the fixed term issue, and dismissed with respect to the claim for loss.
[12] Judgment accordingly.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer.
The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012.
On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy.
The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice.
The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting.
He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1.
Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy.
The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act.
HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy.
The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term.
The appeal was allowed on this issue.
The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant.

The Applicant has made it clear that they intend to have civil jury trial, regardless of how the matters are ultimately formulated.
This would include the intention of having one jury hear four consecutive trials.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions.
The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation.
The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation.
The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions.
The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court.
The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants.

DEALERS ASSOCIATION OF CANADA,","This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct.
The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel.
The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances.
In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend.
The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission.
The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard.
Dismissing the application for an interim injunction,
that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","[0, 6, 3, 2, 9, 7, 81, 90, 89, 94, 91]"

Donald MacLennan, for the defence
He elected trial by jury.
First and primarily, he says that the blood sample was taken pursuant to warrant, proportedly obtained from Provincial Court judge, pursuant to the provisions of s. 487.05(1) of the Code.

HEARD: Sydney, Nova Scotia, on February 8, 1999
DECISION: February 9, 1999 (Orally)
Sexual assault, s. 271 of the Criminal Code.
SUMMARY: Accused charged with the sexual assault (which led to the impregnation) of his step-daughter who, at age 13, gave birth to full term baby girl.
Accused sought to exclude DNA evidence on the basis that his s. and s. Charter Rights were breached when the police took sample of his blood.
Following voir dire, held that the accused had failed to show any violation of his Charter Rights. DNA evidence ruled admissible.
Accused then re-elected to be tried by Supreme Court Justice alone and changed his plea to guilty.
Remanded into custody and sentencing scheduled for April 6, 1999.

The accused challenged the validity of the warrant.

R. Halifax, Nova Scotia
February 4, 2010","The bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of approximately $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans.
Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle.
Relief granted;
to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.
The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment.
Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","[100, 101, 0, 9, 4, 14, 90, 96, 99, 5, 95, 10, 88, 89, 19, 23, 15, 20, 74, 73]"
967,"[1] The within petition was launched almost four years ago and the usual relief was claimed, namely: divorce, joint custody, access, child support, spousal support and division of family property.
Judgments were entered accordingly.
This came to an end on August 1, 2004, when the petitioner moved to Medicine Hat, Alberta.
The three girls moved with her.
To that date the respondent had been paying $300.00 month as child support, but he made no payment for the month of June.
The payments were based on an imputed annual income of $26,500.00.
It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation now be effected.
It is said that this has not been done.
[37] There is one further collateral matter.
In the future it may be otherwise.
[38] This is the money owing by the respondent:
337.12 Extraordinary expenses
$2,857.00 Travelling expenses of petitioner
(2) That the said sum of $4,237.16 shall be paid by monthly payments of $350.00 commencing November 1, 2007;
(3) That no child support is presently payable as incomes are comparable, but each party shall pay 50% of all extraordinary expenses;
(5) That the respondent shall forthwith pay to the petitioner as court costs the sum of $1,200.00.","The outstanding issue is child support, past and future.
The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past.
Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income.
HELD: 1)
The respondent is a farmer.
His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made.
The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment.
However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose.
It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income.
In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support.
The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%.
An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added.
The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528.
As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005.
2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe.
This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused.
The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally.
It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now.
3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support.
The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable.
3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access.
She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.
 4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","[194, 196, 4, 189, 19, 0, 190, 176, 193, 179, 21, 184, 185, 13, 25, 12]"
968,"On August 13, 2003 Constable Smith and Corporal Campbell of the R.C.M.P. were on routine patrol in the area of the Government Wharf in Western Shore, Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia.
There had been prior mischief complaints from the public regarding activity in the area and the officers approached several youth standing near vehicles on the wharf.
Upon asking who owned the vehicle young male came forward by the name of Josh Hyslop.
The officers advised they were going to search the vehicle for liquor and then found in the rear hatch area of the vehicle cooler which contained more alcohol.
Additionally in the front pocket was the wallet of the accused containing identification papers, licenses and personal papers.
[20] Hyslop’s evidence establishes that the defendant handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the motor vehicle to him, and that no money changed hands for it.
[23] find that the defendant was in possession of the marijuana and cocaine found in his knapsack.
For the purpose of trafficking
Hence find that the defendant had them in his possession knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment.
Conclusion [26] The defendant is guilty of all three charges before the court.","The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking.
When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer.
While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it.
The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash.
In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers.
They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle.
The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted.
The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle.
When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left.
The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial.
The defendant was found guilty on all charges.
The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession.
The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there.
The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","[63, 62, 51, 57, 10, 3, 5, 58, 6, 2]"

The stay was granted upon the applications of the respondent corporations and was to remain in effect until an action against them by one Faye McMaster, not party to these proceedings, was settled or otherwise completed.
Indeed, it could be said that her findings in respect of s. were obiter dictum as not being strictly necessary to the decision, and made only because that was the way the matter was put to her by previous decision of the court and the agreement of the parties.
[4] Since the judge made it clear that the part of her judgment which the Superintendent says was wrong was made “without any adjudication on the merits” the matter is left open for the Superintendent to argue another day, either in the stayed proceeding or in another case, in proper factual context, which was lacking here.

That the accused is status Treaty Indian, with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights to fish for sustenance;
The onus of proving prima facie infringement lies on the individual or group challenging the legislation.
[67] The justification test set out by the Supreme Court in Sparrow involved two main questions:
An objective aimed at preserving s. 35(1) rights by conserving and managing natural resource, for example, would be valid.
[70] As stated earlier, the uncontradicted evidence clearly establishes the need to protect the fish stocks which was the sole intent of the regulations.
This in turn raises two questions:
a) Has there been as little infringement as reasonably possible in order to affect the desired outcome?
Considering the three letters of 1993; 1996 and 2016 the logical interpretation of the letters and inference to be drawn is that the answer is yes.","/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry.
The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food.
He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike.
The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish.
The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round.
The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence.
Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights.
The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing.
The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning.
He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing.
The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n
HELD: The accused was found guilty.
The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","[12, 17, 369, 362, 18, 5, 11, 8, 1, 23, 366, 30, 350, 38, 372, 24, 368, 353]"

do not find Mr. Hanson's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary inquiry (eight months after the robbery) nor at trial (eleven months after the robbery) to be reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months after the robbery and gave an accurate description to the police immediately at the time of the robbery.
[17] In weighing the entirety of the letter, have concluded that it is tantamount to an admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery, and that he attempted to manufacture an alibi by eliciting false testimony from potential witness.
am satisfied that the sole reason for the intended fabrication was to deceive the court; there is no other express or inferred explanation in evidence.
The admission by the accused that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery, taken together with his knowledge of all of the circumstances of the offence and his plan to meet that evidence at trial by fabricating evidence, warrants an adverse inference against him which, together with the identification facts which have been proved, leads to the reasonable and just conclusion that the accused is the person who committed the robbery.","The accused is on trial for armed robbery and the central issue is identity.
The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him.
HELD: Accused found guilty.
The accused was correctly identified.
The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by.
The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.
The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","[198, 195, 9, 192, 199]"

[81] agree with the submission of the Crown that such is not an appropriate remedy in the circumstances of this case.
The Act [MPA] includes provisions which act as preconditions to applications that presume the existence of legal marriage.
There is no universally accepted definition of common law spouse: Rossu v. Taylor (1998), 1998 ABCA 193 (CanLII), 39 R.F.L. (4th) 242].
Even the [Final Report of the Law Reform Commission of Nova Scotia] advocates remedy significantly different than that claimed by the Appellant.

She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship.
The Chambers judge dismissed the application.
He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter.
Allowing the appeal,
that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship.
The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect.

The adjournment of these issues was conceded by defence and Crown to have no impact on the ability of the preliminary hearing to proceed.","The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances.
The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'.
The motion has two components.
The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'.
The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. 
The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1)
There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence.
In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos.
The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer.
The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested.
The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2)
The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld.
The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available.
What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit.
This information is often crucial for the defence.
3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks.
It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.
In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.
 4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","[104, 102, 8, 11, 101, 96, 0]"
977,"[1] This is an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board.
The respondent Paul Warren appealed the decision by filing notice of appeal with the Board on October 13,1998.
He did not serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality, but the clerk of the Board forwarded the notice to the Municipality.
[3] Section 85 and s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act read:
[9] Section 63(3) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 32, like s. 85 of the Assessment Act, supra, provided right of appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board. Section 63(6) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.32, like s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, supra, set out the requirements of service of the notice of appeal.
[10] In allowing the appeal from the Board’s decision Southey, J. said:
That jurisdiction is derived in the first instance in this case from s. 63(3).
Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s. 63(6) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions.
[12] It is not therefore necessary to consider the other points raised in argument.
The appeal is dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the Municipality, in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.
Concurred in:","The appellant appealed a preliminary decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board which held that it had jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal where, although the appellant failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, the party not properly served waived the requirement.

that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.","[1, 28, 4, 25, 29, 30, 22, 24, 5, 8, 21]"

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT
In our view, in s. 20 there is similarly compromise or balancing in seeking to weigh the information of public body that should be disclosed and information, if disclosed, that would amount to an unreasonable invasion of third party's personal privacy.
It necessarily follows that recommendations by the authors founded or based on such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and likewise not to be disclosed.
As such the information referred to above is to be edited out of the report as well as any recommendations based on such personal information.
The Regional Hospital, on the representations made to this Court, has consented to the release of the report.
The report also deals with Identification and Terms of Reference, Process and Documents reviewed, and Background Issues Regarding Suicide and, like the findings as to the treatment, diagnosis or assessment and care of the three deceased, these are not matters of peer review.","Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices.
At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer.
The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential.
Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families.
An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report.

Allowing the appeal,
that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy.
Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information.

[2] Mr. Carlson died October 13, 2001, and his will dated November 11, 2000, was admitted to probate January 28, 2002.
By his will he bequeathed to four of his nieces his entire estate of approximately $291,000.00.

The documents are material in the present litigation.
The same information as contained in the documents, although perhaps in some other form, was available to the plaintiffs from other sources.
1. What was the relationship between Lois Hudson and the law firm of Politeski Strilchuk Milen when the documents were delivered to them?
In the circumstances of this case, am satisfied that no duty was owed to Lois Hudson by Ms. Polischuk when she accepted delivery of documents from her client, Neil Hudson.
[9] In my view no solicitor-client relationship was created between Ms. Polischuk and Lois Hudson when, what proved to be confidential documents, were received by her from Neil Hudson.
The fact that Neil Hudson now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not, in my opinion, change the situation that existed in 1995.
To extend the confidentiality of solicitor-client relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in my view, lead to unreasonable results.

The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995.
These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses.
The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.
HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.
No solicitor-client relationship was created between the husband's lawyer and the applicant when the documents were received.
There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.
No fiduciary duty was owed to the applicant when the solicitor accepted the documents from the applicant's husband.
The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping.

At the commencement of the trial, counsel for the boys’ mother, Melody, indicated that she supported her parents’ application for custody.
S.J. No. 592 (QL), Wilkinson J. opined at paras. to as follows:
[4] The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. (1989-90), c. C-7.2 (the “Act”) sets out clear objectives.
Where the Court is of that view, it may make long-term order placing the child in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18.
(a) remain with, be returned to or be placed in the custody of his or her parent;
(4) In making an order pursuant to subsection (1), (2) or (3), the court:
An examination of the familial context of Art and Laura presents real concerns.
Additionally, it is pertinent to observe that Art and Laura have three children and Art has three children from other partnerships.
(i) I find that David and Michael are children in need of protection under s. 11(1)(b) of The Child and Family Services Act.
The conditions respecting such access shall be as determined by MSS to be in the best interests of David and Michael or as ordered by the Court.","The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption.
Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care.
The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody.
HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister.
As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.
 1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys.
However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context.
There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister.
It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.
 Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them.
When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura.
2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people.
With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level.
Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted.
The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","[17, 14, 362, 10, 339, 359, 25, 341, 9, 5, 3]"
984,"[1] On December 13, 2011, the accused, Philip Edward Mullins was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences:
Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.
[2] A sentencing hearing was subsequently held December 19, 2011 after which the court reserved its sentencing judgment now delivered.
The accused was found in bedroom at the far end of the house trailer alone and apparently either sleeping or lying on bed in this bedroom.
In the result, I impose a remaining sentence to be served by Mr. Mullins of 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan.
[41] In addition to the sentence of incarceration imposed upon Mr. Mullins, the court authorizes and directs the following further orders:","The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code.
At issue was the accused's sentence.
The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis.
As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence.
As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit.
The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","[4, 1, 5, 127, 128, 10]"
985,"Between: Her Majesty the Queen
[1] On January 26, 2011, Brian Ben was found guilty on charge of assaulting peace officer with weapon, contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
Is the Predicate Offence “Serious Personal Injury Offence”?
[3] Section s. 752.1(1) of Code states as follows:
“serious personal injury offence” means
and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more ...
The Crown proceeded by indictment and therefore this offence carries maximum penalty of “a term of not more than 10 years”.
Mr. Ben began to run away from the officer.
The officer gave chase.
He was sentenced to two years in jail.
Mr. Jodouin was incarcerated for two years.
Mr. Brooks had lengthy and related criminal record.
[48] Defence counsel submitted that the cases in which an offender was sentenced to term of two years are ones that involve serious violence.
She suggested that an appropriate sentence would be that of six months in custody.
[49] I find that given the serious nature of this offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, and taking into account Mr. Ben’s previous record, a sentence of two years or more is possible.
He has committed serious offences against peace officers in the past on seven occasions, including the present matter.","The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender.
The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The accused was 50 years old.
He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions.
Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers.
He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order.
The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion.
The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer.
The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect.
The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm.
The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family.
HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752.
The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage.
The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage.
Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established.
The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future.
The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour.
Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.
 It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender.
The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","[5, 194, 17, 192, 190, 185, 1, 191, 9, 8, 23, 187, 183, 13, 22, 19]"
986,"[2] The application proceeded by way of voir dire.
The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain Warrant to Search [ITO].
BACKGROUND [5] The accused is charged in an Indictment as follows: 1. THAT HE, the said Dean Lommerse between the 2nd day of April, A.D. 2013 and the 30th day of May, A.D. 2013 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did commit a sexual assault on ----- --------, contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada. 2. THAT HE, the said Dean Lommerse between the 2nd day of April, A.D. 2013 and the 30th day of May, A.D. 2013 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did being in position of trust or authority toward ------ --------, a person aged sixteen years, for a sexual purpose, touch, directly or indirectly, with a part of the body, any part of the body of ------ --------, contrary to section 153(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada. 4. THAT HE, the said Dean Lommerse on or about the 25th day of October, A.D. 2013 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did have in his possession child pornography to wit: possessing digital files of a person who is or depicted as being under the age of eighteen years engaged in or depicted as being engaged in explicit sexual activity, or the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen, contrary to section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
[6] The accused originally came to the attention of the Regina Police Service when the complainant reported having had sexual contact with Mr. Lommerse.
[2] It is difficult to imagine search more intrusive, extensive, or invasive of one’s privacy than the search and seizure of personal computer.
[54] The police, upon seizure of a computer or computer related device are not entitled to rummage through the entire contents of the device searching for other evidence.
computer search pursuant to warrant must be related to the legitimate targets respecting which the police have established reasonable and probable grounds, as articulated in the warrant.
[56] As a result of the forgoing, evidence of the search history was validly obtained pursuant to the execution of the search warrant.
Any other evidence obtained was not pursuant to the search warrant and is accordingly a violation of the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights.","The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography.
The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant.
She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence.
The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO).
The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility.
The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography.
The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”.
The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment.
The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower.
The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos.
The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs.
The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused.
The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant.
The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone.
The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).
The application proceeded by voir dire.
The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire.
The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device.
| HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained.
Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights.
The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search.
The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established.
Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement.
The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.
Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant.
The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record; 
2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means.
This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search.
It was not admitted;
3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context.
There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant;
4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety.
However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence;
5) The ITO provided sufficient description.
It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO.
Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and 
6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence.
The ITO sought only the search history.","[304, 303, 297, 5, 293, 300, 4, 13, 12]"

Any consultant hired by the defendant is in an equally good position to investigate as was the applicants’ consultant, and to offer an opinion on cause and remedy.

[17] The costs of this application are costs in the cause.
[18] Order accordingly.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act.
The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice.
The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood.
The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time.
Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied.
The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes.
HELD: The amendments were allowed.
1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage.
The facts were uncertain.
It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced.
If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period.
2)Inexcusable delay was not established.
3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice.
If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction.
No evidence had been lost.
The basement was available for inspection.
It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants.
4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments.
The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice.
It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff.
It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence.

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property.
HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order.
Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children.
Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job.
It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support.

She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown.

The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value.
The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment.
4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally.
5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.

JUDGMENT D. KOVATCH,
The defence also argues that the complainant and police subjected the accused to an unlawful and unreasonable search and seizure, and infringed her rights contrary to section of the Charter.
[6] Ms. Buchanan testified that at sometime prior to her initial involvement with Ms. Bigsky in January 2015, that Ms. Bigsky’s children were apprehended and were, for period of time, in the care of the Minister of Social Services.
She further testified that Mr. Lerat was charged with an assault upon Ms. Bigsky, and that prior to March 23, 2015, he was released on bail with respect to that assault charge.
She also testified that the children were returned to Ms. Bigsky’s care on the basis that Justin Lerat would not be there with her in the home.
As a result, in my view, the truth seeking function and the administration of justice are better served by exclusion of the evidence.
When I look at all of these factors, I come to the conclusion that all the evidence obtained from and after the unlawful entry of the accused’s home should be excluded.
Having done that, there is no evidence against the accused and I find her not guilty of both charges.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached.
Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home.
The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search.
The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit.
The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home.
There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.
The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights.
The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children.
The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights.
The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","[13, 26, 24, 319, 5, 310, 2, 30, 309]"
990,"In written decision dated September 11, 1996, Madam Justice Gunn awarded costs of the application to Doris Kolody.
Counsel for S.E.D.C.O. argued that the costs referred to were awarded in interlocutory proceedings and should not be taxed until the final determination of the action or proceeding.
In essence, he contends that the taxation is premature.
The facts are clearly set out in the Judgment of Gunn, J. and need not be repeated here in detail.
The proceeding at issue is bankruptcy matter.
The scope of the examination has been an issue and resulted in the court application referred to.
My only concern relates to whether Mrs. Kolody is “party” within the meaning of the rule.
She is not party to the proceeding in the true sense of the word as it involves her husband and S.E.D.C.O.
In the interests of expediting the taxation at that time, can advise the parties that am of the opinion that Column of the tariff is the appropriate column for the costs to be taxed under.
In addition, am also of the opinion that Mrs. Kolody is entitled to $50.00 per day, for three days, which represents day to travel to and from Regina, as well as the day to attend the actual examination.

991,"[1] On February 13, 2004, the respondent, Wayne Joseph Dorosh, acting on his own behalf, applied to this Court, in Chambers, to vary the support and access provisions contained within consent judgment of this Court granted May 2, 1995.
The terms of the 1995 judgment prescribe that Ms. Antonowitsch, is the sole custodian of Letitia.
The matter never proceeded to trial.
[5] On January 24, 2003, Mr. Justice Smith ordered that the last of the variation applications be adjourned sine die in order to await “Voices of Children” report.
Wayne Dorosh applies to vary the custody and child support order of May 2, 1995.
Letitia appeared very genuine in her desire to spend increased time with her father, and indicates the flexibility that has been recently added to the access schedule is exactly what she desired.
[30] Recent appellate decisions confirm that parent can be found to be intentionally under‑employed if that parent is not reasonably maximizing his or her income, regardless of whether there is any accompanying intention to avoid child support obligation.
Commencing September 1, 2004, Mr. Dorosh will pay to Ms.
Antonowitsch the sum of $202.00 on the first day of each and every month for so long as Letitia is child within the meaning of the Divorce Act.
[39] Ms. Antonowitsch is entitled to her taxable costs against Mr. Dorosh.","FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support.
HELD: 1)
On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody.
The child is now 15 years old.
The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting.
The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests.
The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.
 2) The access was varied in January 2004.
Nothing has changed to warrant a variation.
3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time.
There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears.
The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date.
In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund.
If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4)
The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working.
The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control.
The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use.
The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review.
The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","[6, 7, 0, 14, 272, 268, 19, 261, 269, 28]"
992,"[1] The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent’s rights under s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent.
After the police officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning.
Okay. And what did you do when you got to the police station?
We went into the phone room, and dialled Legal Aid. Legal Aid was busy, so hung up, re-tried, it was still busy.
The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.
However, it would be incorrect to simply enter conviction on appeal.
As advised by counsel for the respondent, if the certificate of analyses is rendered admissible there may be other evidence tendered on behalf of the respondent to
Therefore, it is ordered this matter be remitted back to the learned trail judge for continuation of the case, according to law.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent.
The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample.
The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer.
HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable.
Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists.
Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice.
2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice.
Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal.
3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated.
The exchange lasted about minutes.
The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","[130, 124, 0, 131, 3, 133, 6, 14]"

Counsel BY THE COURT:
[1] The Claimants are Husband and Wife who own home sitting on lovely several acre property in Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia.
[2] The Defendant Renouf is friend of the Defendant Burrows.
[3] The issue in this unusual case concerns some trees that the Defendant Renouf cut down on the Claimants’ property, by mistake, while allegedly doing a favour for the Defendant Burrows.
[4] The Defendant Renouf does not live on or near either of these properties.
[49] As such, I do not consider the Counterclaim to have been established and it will be dismissed.
These are incontestable.
The amounts that have been documented and filed include the following amounts:
service of subpoena on Andrew Helpard
$84.75 service of subpoena on Trevor Chisholm and Mike Delude (plus travel)
[53] There appears also to have been some witness fees provided to some of the witnesses, although full details were not provided.
Having said that, however, am willing to allow the costs as submitted, on the basis that the case was large one, and it had been met with large Counterclaim which, though not seriously pursued, was nonetheless hanging over the heads of the Claimants as they prepared for the trial.
Eric K. Slone, Adjudicator","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property.
The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend.
As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut.
He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees.
The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field.
At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages.
The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money.
1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages.
That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose.
2. Burrows is not liable.
He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable.
It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do.
Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise.
The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm.
3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help).
While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed.
Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements).
While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","[190, 184, 3, 189, 1, 7, 9, 183, 8, 197, 194, 177, 181, 4]"

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents.
The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing.
Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children.
The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents.
The biological father had custody of her at the present time.
The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children.
Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned.
Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province.
Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met.

[28] Here the technician who installed the equipment and who had the most direct contact with the Plaintiff is now deceased and cannot offer his opinion or evidence on what occurred past October of 2007.
The mere fact that there was some communication between the parties after that time does not in my opinion help the Plaintiff as there was never service contract entered into between these two parties.
The only agreement that they had was to supply and install the equipment - not to maintain, service or reprogram it.
He tried to address subsequent complaints but in my opinion, these were outside the parameters of the original agreement as no service contract between the parties existed.
[30] I further find there was no material representation and no fraud.
One would assume that if business owner continues to make payments on equipment, that he is content with that equipment.
[31] I must conclude from the evidence I have heard that there is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the Plaintiff’s claim to succeed.
The Defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to supply and it has been in the exclusive possession of the Plaintiff at all material times.","The plaintiff entered into a verbal agreement for the defendant to supply and install business equipment.
The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000.

[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about November 29, 2010, at Saskatoon, commit common assault against the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
Regardless, the accused bears no onus whatsoever in these proceedings.
In order to defend himself he had pushed the complainant with one hand, which caused her to step back.
The accused had also made some nature of comment that he would stab or hit the complainant’s father, because he had called her, the accused’s mother, bitch.
[23] Regardless, it is apparent that there was great deal of animosity and bad blood which made it difficult for the witnesses to recall and relate in reliable way what may have happened on the spur of the moment between the parties.
As such, perhaps it is possible that the complainant had initiated the physical aggression by hitting the accused on the shoulder in frustration at how matters had unfolded to which he reacted with blow.
[25] As such, applying the principles in McKenzie, supra, the Court does not know who to believe, and he is not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant.
The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

understood Mr. Saretzky to be agreeing that the presumption of non-provocation that’s set out in s. 135.2(1) of The Urban Municipalities Act applies, and that that presumption has not been displaced.
[3] Mr. Saretzky provided dictionary definition with respect to the word “attack,” and that definition, as noted it, was, “To set upon violently, to begin battle.”
THE COURT: So you shall display a sign on the fence enclosing the dog, warning of the presence of the dog with the following wording, “Guard Dog on Duty, Beware of Dog,” and you shall continue to display the sign in good condition as long as the dog is present on the property.
(h) Where the dog is to be sold or given away, you shall notify any prospective owner of this Court Order before it is sold or given away, and you shall notify the Clerk of the municipality of the name, address and telephone number of any new owner of the dog.
And believe that covers all of the conditions that the Court considers are necessary.
MR. SARETZKY: think those are satisfactory, Your Honour.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3).
There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001.
At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions.
The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced.
HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions.
The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post.
There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled.
The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty.
2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation.
3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3).
It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands.
The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed.
logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.
One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","[95, 1, 8, 93, 92, 16, 18, 17, 89]"

[2] The Appellant appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) dated June 16th, 2010, filed with the Court on the same date and, within the 30 day appeal period.
The singular ground of appeal cited in the Appellant’s Notice is a “Failure to Follow the Requirements of Natural Justice”.
[3] The particulars of the Appellant’s Appeal are based mainly on his claim that he did not know the hearing took place and, when he failed to show up, Judgment was awarded against him.
The learned Adjudicator, after numerous attempts by the Respondent to serve the Appellant, issued an Order for Substituted Service.
Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service granted by the Adjudicator in accordance with the provisions of the Act and regulations of the Small Claims Court.
Service having been properly effected on the Respondent, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding of the Small Claims Adjudicator
[21] In the result, the Appellant must accept the consequences of his decision to ignore the notice
It therefore follows, that the court was entitled to issue default judgement against him.
[22] find therefore that the Appellant’s appeal is without merit.
[23] Accordingly the Appeal dismissed with costs .","The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim.
As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message.
He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35.
The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice.
He denied being in contact with his mother.
He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries.
New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny.
Here the respondent's claim was valid.
The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it.
At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s).
While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.
He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","[90, 91, 88, 92, 87, 7, 5, 6, 0, 85, 8]"

The Parties agree that the Husband shall have interim sole custody of the child of the marriage and the Wife shall have access to the child of the marriage upon reasonable notice to the Husband.
[3] The applicant indicates in her affidavit that on or about July, 1996, she was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar/clinical depression.
She states that on or about October 30, 1997, she felt she was beginning to suffer an emotional breakdown and voluntarily admitted herself into the Royal University Hospital for psychiatric treatment, from which she was discharged on November 14, 1997.
With respect to the agreement, she states in para.
The respondent resisted the applicant‘s request for overnight access on the basis that in his opinion the applicant‘s emotional health makes it difficult for her to cope with Jacob over extended periods of time.
On the basis of this evidence, I am satisfied Jacob will not be at risk if the applicant is granted overnight access,
and it is ordered the applicant have access to Jacob as follows:(1) Every second weekend from after kindergarten on Fridays to 7:00 p.m. Sunday night commencing Friday, March 12, 1999.(2) Every Tuesday from 1:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.(3) Every Thursday from 1:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in the weeks the applicant does not have access that weekend.
[12] Order accordingly.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access.
The father counter applied for interim custody.
The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.
The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression.
The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city.
HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed.
Overnight access was granted to the mother.
1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason.
It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child.
The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage.
2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","[0, 5, 4, 52, 6, 54, 56, 7, 55]"

[3] In this case it is important to outline the family relationships as number of individuals were referred to in testimony.
[8] At no times relevant to these allegations did D. G. and M. G. live at the same residence.
[15] Of the witnesses that testified, SG and her mother, and A. G. were the only ones in position to say where the households might have lived and for what time periods between 1999 and 2009.
The best she could muster was to say: “I knew she was younger than me”.

G., in the context of the evidence in this case, found her evidence to be generally unreliable and not credible, with some exceptions which noted earlier in this decision.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15.
The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details.
He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father.
Accused found guilty of all counts.
Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances.
Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor.
The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","[7, 2, 415, 17, 10, 31, 402, 407, 8]"

PUBLISHERS OF THIS CASE PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT s. 94(1) OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT APPLIES AND MAY REQUIRE EDITING OF THIS JUDGMENT OR ITS HEADING BEFORE PUBLICATION.
[1] The appellant is the birth mother of the child J.E.S.
The child was returned to her birth parents but again apprehended by the child welfare authorities.
[22] Section 83 of the Act permits an appeal of an adoption order:
[23] The judge was entitled to dispense with the mother’s consent if she did not appear at the adoption hearing.
It would be procedurally just to set the adoption order aside and permit the appellant to be heard.
[24] Before doing so, however, it is appropriate that consider whether such result would be in the best interests of the child.
However, I am satisfied that allowing the appeal and remitting the matter is consistent with the child’s best interests.
It is, in my view, in the child’s best interests that her birth mother’s wish to have access be determined on the application to adopt.
[26] I would allow the appeal, set aside the adoption order and remit the adoption application to a judge of the Family Division.","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child.
Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents.
Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing.
Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence.
The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.
Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","[96, 1, 92, 10, 6, 5, 15, 89, 86, 80, 82, 85]"

[29] Similarly, Saskatchewan’s options for raising applicable time limitation periods and/or striking out pleadings include, for example, an application to strike out some or all of the plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 173, or an application to determine point of law under Rule 188.
Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims.
The application is therefore dismissed.
In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.","FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan.
They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005.
In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant.
Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim.
The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents.
HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim.
However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.
Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims.

In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay surcharge.
[2] They then appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench.
For the reasons that follow, we are also of the opinion the appeal should be allowed and the convictions restored.
[10] As we say, the circumstances in this case are such as to bring the case squarely within these provisions.
In our respectful judgment this went quite beyond what the case called for.
[11] We should add that Mr. Varga was assumed throughout to have been responsible, along with Chisum Log Home and Lumber Ltd, for the operation of the Weyakwin facility.
Nothing was made of his liability, as distinct form that of the company, either in this Court or in the courts below, so nothing we have said is to be taken as having any bearing on whether he, too, needed license.
[12] For these reasons, then, we have decided to allow the appeal, set aside the decision in the Court of Queen’s Bench, and restore the decision of the trial judge.
As for the fines and surcharges, there is nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they too must stand.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act.
The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga.
The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands.
The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages.
In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act.
HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal.
Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1.
As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","[43, 41, 0, 2, 38, 34, 40, 37, 11, 6, 5]"

It claims that as result of these actions the plaintiff “was convicted improperly” (paragraph of the Statement of Claim).
Particulars of negligence were set out in paragraph of the claim and the plaintiff sought to support these by the evidence that she and her husband, together with number of other witnesses gave at the trial.
(a) Allegations that the defendant Tochor failed to call witnesses at the plaintiff’s trial referred to him by the plaintiff and which the plaintiff considers could have provided evidence at the trial helpful to her case;
witness, non-expert, who was at the trial and does not think the lawyer did very good job will not be permitted to give that evidence before jury.

security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Registry on September 11, 2000.
It lapsed year later and was re-registered November 14, 2001.
[2] Kimberly Clayton, Mr. McMillan's wife, had apparently been the person who used the Blazer and who had made payments on it under the original purchase agreement.
She was shown as co-buyer on that purchase agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate.
[10] In summary then hold that ownership does not depend upon registration.
There are many unregistered vehicles.
However, once vehicle is registered following declaration of ownership, presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership.
[11] The applicant has also argued that at time when the registration of the Credit Union had lapsed, she transferred ownership from her husband's name to her name.
In the special circumstances of this matter decline to order costs of either motion.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan.
A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001.
After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer.
His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate.
She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession.
At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it.
HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable.
Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance.
The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act.
That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle.
Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry.
Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away.
Ownership does not depend upon registration.
However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership.
A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice.

The petitioner shall not enter this room whether locked or not;

d. Counsel for the petitioner failed, due to misunderstanding as to the adjourned date, to attend on September and thus counsel for the respondent was in attendance on both September and 2.","HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made.
The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography.
The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner.
The petitioner did not dispute that evidence.
The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions.
The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction.
The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent.
With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated.
The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD.
The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent.
It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis.
A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.
The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting.
The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","[1, 280, 15, 283, 272, 267, 273, 26, 260, 261]"

The defendants deny that this transaction was loan to the individual Kelly Eiswerth, and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her then husband Ken Eiswerth into the auto brokering business known as Auto Brokers 1999 (“E M”), which was registered business name of the defendant company 627089 Saskatchewan Ltd.

[20] As that claim fails, Issue No. becomes moot.","The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest.
The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000.
The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan.
However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made.
In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly.

I. introduction
[1] The Director under The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, S.S. 2009, c. S-46.002 (the “Act”) seeks leave to appeal Queen’s Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of vehicle registered to the respondent Cheryl Brinkman.
[3] The vehicle in question (the “Vehicle”) is 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van. Ms. Brinkman purchased it in 2010, with money received from her father’s estate.
[4] In March of 2012, Mr. Tropeau was seen removing copper material from the back of truck.
Mr. Tropeau was found in the back of parked truck with rolls of copper in his arms.
Paragraph of his decision would suggest that the judge did consider matters relating to the deterrence of crime.
The Chambers judge was also at pains to underline the exceptional nature of his power to deny forfeiture application.
[20] Taking into account both the merits and the importance of the Director’s proposed appeal, I am not persuaded by his arguments about granting leave to appeal.
V. conclusion
The Vehicle shall be returned to its owner, Ms. Brinkman.

Richards C.J.S.","HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police.
The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave.
The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims.
The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground.
The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account.
The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days.
The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","[2, 68, 65, 0, 69, 12, 72, 6, 3, 74, 64, 9, 73]"
1012,"[1] Andel Griffiths (“Griffiths”) born September 7, 1975 is Jamaican national living in Saskatoon with his wife Jennifer, Canadian citizen.
He has established residence in Saskatoon.
[2] The United States of America (“USA”) seeks to extradite Griffiths to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine.
Griffiths was arrested in Saskatoon on May 28, 2003.
Section 24 of the Act obligates the court to proceed with an extradition hearing.
[11] Disclosure of the information and materials applied for might, if committed, assist the applicant in his attempt to persuade the Minister not to surrender him.
[12] Counsel for Griffiths argues that the application before Krueger J. in the Daul case was under s. of the Charter and no consideration was given to parallel common law rights advanced on behalf of Griffiths, specifically, denial of natural justice.
[14] am not prepared to award costs against Griffiths’ solicitor as requested by counsel for the Attorney General.
[15] The motion on behalf of the Attorney General to set a date for the extradition hearing is granted.
The hearing is to proceed on January 6, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. or at such other date and time as counsel may agree upon in consultation with the Local Registrar.","The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine.
The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing.

He also seeks costs of the application.
[2] The facts are fairly straightforward.
They separated in August 1996, after 12 years of marriage.
At the time of the hearing, the applicant and respondent were 46 and 42 years of age respectively.
The parties were divorced in 1998.
[4] Before the corollary relief judgment was granted, there was an interim order of $400.00 per month commencing April 1998.
His evidence was that his family life came first.
[38] Notwithstanding the wife’s disability, I cannot conclude that his obligation to her should extend beyond the length of their marriage.
The respondent is now 42.
While she may not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there is no evidence that she is unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.
[40] This application was heard in June 2005.
The applicant received severance package and his pension was to start in September 2005.
Should there be change in the parties’ circumstances before then, an application to vary may be warranted, but in any event, the spousal support will end in August 2008.","The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination.
The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years.
The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension.
The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment.
The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care.
Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate.
Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","[2, 146, 0, 6, 9, 147, 7, 14, 143, 150, 134, 20, 3, 145]"
1014,"[1] [E.C.] stands charged that on September 26, 2006 at the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, he did commit an assault on [A.G.], contrary to Section 266 of the Criminal Code.
[2] On the trial date, the Crown applied to have admitted in evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbour and to the police on September 26, 2006 for consideration of the truth of their contents.
[4] The facts are relatively straight-forward.
The complainant, [A.G.], is the common- law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years.
In September of 2006, they lived in an apartment building next door to [D.P.], friend of Ms. [A.G.]’s daughter.
Ms. [A.G.] did not have telephone at her own suite.
[7] When the complainant came to the [P.] apartment, she was very upset, scared and crying.
N.W.T.J. No. 20, the court allowed the hearsay statements of complainant on the basis of the res gestae exception.
[28] In R. v. Nickerson, [1996]
[29] In R.v. Pritchett, [1995]
The court on appeal also pointed to the accused’s subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour as further indicator of reliability.
[32] Given the above circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, the statements made by Ms. [A.G.] are found to be reliable on a balance of probabilities and are, therefore, admissible.","The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents.
HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.
 1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity.
A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source.
2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence.
Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage.
Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.
The test of necessity has been met.
 3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.
Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.
The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","[90, 87, 6, 2, 84, 82, 7, 13, 14, 1, 76, 8]"
1015,"[1] On February 26,1995, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the applicant Peters, age 34, sustained injury to his lower back in an automobile accident.
His condition slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in late October of 1995 and diagnosed with large central and right sided disc herniation at the L5/S1 level.
He made an application under Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. A- 35 (the “Act”), for income replacement benefits contending that the accident of February 26,1995 caused the disc herniation.
It took the position the disc herniation was not caused by the accident.
Pursuant to s. 194(1) of the Act, Peters applied to the respondent for review of its decision.
[12] However, in this case, there is other evidence. Dr. Flotre, the medical director of rehabilitation services for the respondent, testified that in his opinion the accident did not cause the disc herniation.
Dr. Flotre\'s opinion was supported by Dr. Stewart, the orthopaedic surgeon who treated Peters for the herniation, who also opined that the herniation was not caused by the accident.
[13] A review of all of the evidence leads me to conclude that Peters has not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.
His appeal is dismissed.","The applicant sustained a lower back injury in an automobile accident in February 1995 which resolved within ten days to two weeks.
In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995.
He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation.
SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.
In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation.
HELD: The appeal was dismissed.
The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.
Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.","[3, 0, 39, 40, 6, 31, 36, 4, 7]"
1016,"FIAT NOBLE J.
May 27, 1996
The parties separated in the summer of 1994.
All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance.
The petitioner and the applicant agreed December 15,
1994 that he would pay her $3,000.00 per month which sum
There is no evidence as to what the applicant will require if she does go to university this fall.
There is uncertainty as to what the two children are going to do about future education.
As result am of the view that in these circumstances and bearing in
mind that this is an interim application it would be premature
to apply the amount of maintenance the guidelines suggest.
Had these payments continued the applicant
would have recovered $6,000.00 at this point in time instead
of $3,000.00.
Accordingly I direct that the petitioner pay spousal maintenance to the applicant commencing June 1, 1996 as follows:(a)$1,500.00 on the 1st day of each month; and (b)$200.00 on the 1st day of each month towards the shortfall resulting from the reduction in payent from $1,500.00 to $1,000.00 in 1996 until the said shortfall has been paid in full.
to be taxed in the usual way.","FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance.
The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late.
The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment.
The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain.
HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant.
There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education.
2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance.
3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.
 4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","[58, 60, 54, 63, 57, 53, 2, 4, 1, 55, 6, 7, 8, 51, 52, 61]"

When the oncoming vehicle was about 100 150 metres from the police vehicle it veered off the main road and down what Constable De Bruin called “goat trail”.
He also testified that he stopped the vehicle for the purpose of checking for driver’s licence, registration and sobriety.
[39] Defence relies on the By decision and submits that since the observation period was not properly conducted the Crown cannot rely on the presumption.
[40] Defence Exhibit D-2, the Rosetown detachment cell block video, shows that the police officer had his back turned to the accused for approximately 2½ minutes.
At one point he actually left the hallway where the accused was sitting to go to another room.
The video had no audio component to it, and Constable De Bruin agreed during cross-examination that burp could be silent.
In both cases the police officer was attending to other tasks and not focussing on the accused.
In both cases the police officer was actually absent for period of time from the accused’s presence.

1019,"[1] The defendants bring this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC"").
[4] The defendants filed statement of defence on October 21, 1998 and have subsequently brought third party proceedings against the City of Saskatoon, Fire Chief William Hewitt, and numerous architects and engineers.
If question has already been asked and answered by one of the three proper officers put forward by the plaintiffs, there is no need for the question to be answered second time.
The fact that the defendants agreed to examine three officers does not mean that they agreed to restrict themselves as to the questions that they could ask each of the three officers.
Suffice it for me to say that as general rule, examinations for discovery should be completed before party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings.
[73] There may be exceptional circumstances where in some cases the court will order compliance with undertakings before the examinations are completed.
The defendants have failed to satisfy me that any such exceptional circumstances exist in this case
[74] leave the matter of costs to be dealt with by the trial judge.","The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings.
The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper.
HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action.
2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire.
3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage.
4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged.
The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal.
5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation.
Questions can be asked of the city.
6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege.
7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague.
The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million.
A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division).
The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion.
8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged.
9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department.
10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential.
The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged.
11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.
 12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position.
They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date.
Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it.
There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question.
The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement.
19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.
 20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them.
21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed.
It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer.
The same question can be put if the first did not answer it.
The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each.
The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings.
Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was.
Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings.
As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings.
It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with.
There were no exceptional circumstances.

1020,"[3] The plaintiff, Russell Lambert Sinclair (“Sinclair”), is resident of Alberta who claims individually and as representative subclass plaintiff who is non-resident of Saskatchewan on behalf of Indian war veterans residing outside the Province of Saskatchewan.
13. The Plaintiff, RUSSELL LAMBERT SINCLAIR, alleges that he was entitled to the full benefits available from the Crown payable to discharged veterans and further that veterans who were Indians and resided outside the Province of Saskatchewan did not receive any or any full benefits for their service either in World War II or in the Korean War as did non-aboriginal veterans.
[5] The plaintiff, Stella Marjorie Severeight (“Severeight”) claims she was dependant of an Indian veteran of World War II and she sues both individually and on behalf of all dependants that did not receive benefits to which they were lawfully entitled to from the Crown as dependants of Indian war veterans.
(b) common but not necessarily identical issues of law that arise from common but not necessarily identical facts.
(i) judicial economy, or the efficient handling of potentially complex cases of mass wrongs;
(iii) modification of behaviour of actual or potential wrongdoers who might otherwise be tempted to ignore public obligations.
Those are significant claims which can otherwise be asserted.
The issues of discoverability relating to each individual plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.","Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act.
The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances.
The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues.
It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion.
It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years.
Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues.
A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis.
Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision.

The Crown contends that the offender fits the criteria for dangerous offenders and should be declared to be one and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
If found to be long‑term offender, it is then necessary to impose an appropriate determinate sentence to go along with the long‑term supervision order.
[7] An amended notice of application was provided to the offender and filed with the Court on September 20, 2011.
The interests of all concerned require the maximum supervision available under the law.
[84] Because the predicate offence is an offence in which violence against person was used, threatened or attempted, and for which person may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more, s. 109 of the Criminal Code, pertaining to weapons prohibitions, has application.
[85] The predicate offence of aggravated assault, for which the offender was convicted, is primary designated offence within the meaning of s. 487.04 of the Criminal Code.
Accordingly, the victim surcharge is waived pursuant to s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code.
[88] Accordingly, order that my reasons for sentencing, together with all exhibits, assessments, required transcripts and documents be forwarded to the Correctional Service of Canada.","The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.
The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed.
The accused is 52 years old and in poor health.
He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders.
The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence.
Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community.
The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed?
HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse.
2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women.
3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c).
The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system.
The appropriate sentence should be 7 years.
As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis.
The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","[498, 3, 8, 4, 15, 496, 505, 502, 490]"

[55] That said, such change is not always easy, and the necessary insight to make the change is often difficult to acquire.
More importantly, where change is made and insight is acquired, it is rarely, if ever, done alone.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time.
The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest.
The child had lived with them since birth.
The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born.
The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences.
The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges.
The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents.
Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order.
Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child.
Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child.
Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate.
| HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order.
That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father.
The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions.
On their own, such statements were insufficient.
There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.
These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","[346, 345, 3, 4, 17, 7, 335, 0, 27, 328, 344, 325, 322, 23, 339]"

She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy.
HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs.
1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her.
The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics.
2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part.
The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix.
Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted.
The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage.
ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4:

1025,"3. As that particular vehicle passed Cpl. McLean on Broadway Avenue, he pulled in behind it and followed it for one or two blocks.
When it turned north on Barber Avenue, Cpl. McLean turned on the emergency lights and the accused did not stop until Cpl. McLean pulled alongside him and honked his horn to get his attention, about block later.
4. The accused was the lone occupant and identified himself to Cpl.McLean as Joshua Schwartz and because of smell of liquor emanating from the vehicle, asked if the accused had anything to drink.
6. As result of the fail, Cpl. McLean believed his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol and made breathalyser demand on the accused, gave him his rights to counsel including free legal aid and police warning.
8. Cpl. McLean observed through the window the accused use the phone for short period of time.
The accused then stood there and after hanging up the phone, made no attempt to move towards the door.
63. Furthermore, the accused did provide an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about one hour before.
I find that the intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code.
He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing.
HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples.
The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed.
The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer.
Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times.
It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel.
2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks.
The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece.
He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior.
The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted.
It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample.
The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused.
Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition.
He should not drink and drive.","[245, 8, 12, 6, 16, 15, 240, 7]"

This application by FMI is dismissed and the usual bidding rules shall apply.
[24] The plaintiff FMI shall have its costs to be taxed in the usual way.","The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits.
The defendant failed to make any payment.
The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale.
The defendant was a developer.
He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act.
The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price.
HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply.
The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA.
There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision.
The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants.
The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price.
Normal bidding rules shall apply.

1028,"By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Richards
[1] The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (“YCJA”) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order.
[2] The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent’s sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired.
In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order.
for the reasons which follow, that the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA.
She concluded that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the sentence had already expired.
[46] One of the issues canvassed by the Youth Court judge in her reasons was the point which is at issue in the current appeal.
In her reasons for decision in this case, the Youth Court judge quoted at some length from K.P.A. #1 by way of an introduction to her analysis.
[48] appreciate that in K.P.A. #1 the Youth Court judge was attempting to shed some light on what was then relatively new piece of legislation.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order.
The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later.
His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act.
The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired.
She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order.
The Crown appeals the decision.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act.
On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended.
2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large.
Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision.
The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted.
Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b).
Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern.
There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision.
That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102.
This means two things.
First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person.
Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3)
The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","[7, 11, 222, 8, 226, 0, 227, 22, 4]"
1029,"The petitioner invokes the protocol of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the “Convention”) which is scheduled to the Act.
The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in his or her new environment.
48) In my view, the conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate.
Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut.
49) This is not situation where the Saskatchewan Court has any concern that the judicial system in the state of habitual residence will not operate fairly.
have no hesitation in extending to the Connecticut Superior Court full faith and credit that they will address the issue of custody of Joshua with the best interests of the child as its primary focus.
51) Therefore, I direct the respondent, Renae Yamchuk, previously known as Renae Jones, to return the child, Joshua Jones, born April 10, 2003, to the State of Connecticut, United States of America.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003.
They are married and the family home is in Connecticut.
The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan.
The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.
 1) The child was born in Canada.
He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003.
In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit.
It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child.
In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner.
Reconciliation was attempted.
The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned.
The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada.
For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence.
At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles.
The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy.
Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut.
The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home.
2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.
He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody.
The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody.
The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate.
Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut.
This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","[224, 227, 225, 222, 221, 5, 8]"

am going to accept the recommendation of both the Crown and Defence in relation to his appeal.
I am doing so on the basis that when I read the decision of Judge Williams, actually, his decision is ambiguous to the extent that, although he appears to believe that the Tan case requires that a second conditional discharge not be made available in relation to the matter arising out of similar circumstances in relation to a prior discharge.
Although he believes the Tan case dictates that situation, he nevertheless, during the course of that decision, appears to do the requisite test in determining the use of conditional discharge, so there is degree of ambiguity in relation to the matter.
Should there be further contact of any nature on your part with the woman involved, you will not have to worry about discharge, it will be quite simply, question of how long period of time you are going to be incarcerated.

Cundall, Bridges Baumgartner, the Escrow Agent pursuant to
Article 3.6(c) of the Plan remain in the possession of the

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties.
The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties.
The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical.
HELD: The application was dismissed.
The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs.
With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division.
The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens.
The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported.
Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened.
3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue.
The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted.
The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production.
If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys.
A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing.
The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act.
The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times.
On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a).
5)The second and third tests were not met.
The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value.
It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do.
If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent.
There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan.
The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","[756, 758, 755, 757, 760, 759, 17, 5, 14, 750, 35, 749, 7, 15, 729, 40, 22, 734, 6, 33, 42, 751, 726, 754]"
1034,"Introduction
They claim their damages to be $5,975.95, but acknowledge they owe Mr. Harder for the removal of a bedroom wall.
[2] Mr. Harder, general contractor, denies his workmanship was poor.
[3] In March 2011, the plaintiffs engaged the services of the defendant to perform work for them.
With regard to the remainder of this work, the defendant has failed to prove on balance of probabilities that the work was done and was satisfactory.
[47] The defendant’s counterclaim also deals with his alleged cost to rent tools between April 2011 and October 2011 when he did not have access to his own, at rental cost of $4,844.54.
Further, no documentation or testimony was presented substantiating the swap of labour for tools or the value of that labour.
The Court declines to allow this portion of the defendant’s counterclaim.
[52] The plaintiffs claim their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court.
Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court.
Because the plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim, the Court will allow the cost of issuing their claim in the amount of $41.00, and their reasonable cost for service in the amount of $50.00.","The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home.
The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess.

The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools.
HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff.

Indeed, it is his company.

So Tudex sought new relationship with Lovell.

The repudiation of the contract by Tudex is legitimized.
Tudex further counterclaims for judgment for $56,500, and damages.
The claim for the balance, $25,000, is not well founded.
It is implicit in Crooks' letter of September 18 that Tudex would forgo any claim for payments made to Fossil to the time of termination.

That issue not having been decided in this appeal, it will be open to the parties to raise it again in the future, if for example, an arbitrator finds the dispute not to be arbitrable.
Out of an abundance of caution that these reasons not be seen as settling anything other than the narrow issue which they address, think the wise course is to direct stay of the action which could be lifted by judge of the Supreme Court in appropriate circumstances in the future.
[34] Similarly, the only issue addressed in these reasons is whether this court action should not proceed because an arbitrator has not, in the first instance, determined the issue of arbitrability.

Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank.
The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement.
After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights.
The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.
Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed.
Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court.

This is matter of major concern in the construction industry in Nova Scotia.

He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith.
HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed.
The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests.
The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time.
2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended.
The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs.

INTRODUCTION
Just as he was completing that stop, he heard truck, which turned out to be one driven by Mr. Lehman, on an adjacent street.
The pursuit lasted over about four blocks, during which Mr. Lehman failed to stop at two stop signs before turning onto Highway 5, and after block or so on the highway turned onto Baker Street, where he finally stopped in the driveway of his house.
[33] Considering Mr. Lehman’s evidence, I am not satisfied that he had a reasonable excuse for not stopping.
[34] Nor do accept Mr. Lehman’s contention that he was not trying to evade this police officer.
The motive for evasion, assuming the absence of reasonable excuse, is of no moment.
[35] There is no doubt on the evidence that Mr. Lehman attempted to get away from the police officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point.
CONCLUSION [37] For the reasons I have stated, Mr. Lehman is found not guilty on the impaired driving charge (count 1), guilty on the over .08 charge (count 2) and guilty on the flight from police charge (count 3).

[2] 2007 ABCA 110 (CanLII) at para 10.","Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08
The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)).
As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours.
When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off.
The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house.
The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD.
He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17.
The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired.
He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him.
He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples.
The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal.
The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving.
The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes.
The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45.
An alcohol expert and the accused testified.
The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to.
The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer.
The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007.
HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence.
The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis.
The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections.
The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption.
Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions.
The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances.
The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping.
There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face.
The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","[134, 132, 10, 14, 137, 2, 128, 6, 135, 131, 123]"

In its totality, find his evidence to be credible.
Mr. Carvery is guilty of the offences with which he is charged.","The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.
He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction.
After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building.
Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand.
The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged.
A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket.
Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level.
The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall.
Accused found guilty on both counts;
the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction.
The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation.
Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","[6, 7, 5, 1, 139, 147, 145, 144, 142, 146, 11, 149, 137]"

More than two months have now gone by since the affidavit of Marilee Fehr was provided to counsel for the plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of the plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished.

The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew.
Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved.
This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial?

The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device.
The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer.
At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood.
A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings.
A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them.
The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused.
The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook.
The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one.
The accused did not recall this waiver.
The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty.
The accused's readings were .11 and .04.
The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results.
HELD: The appeal was not successful.
Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness.
There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b).
The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice.
The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure.
The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned.
The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective.
The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached.
The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","[186, 176, 13, 2, 0, 8, 185, 190, 1]"
1047,"[1] This appeal is brought by the registered owner of the property, Larry Markwart (“Markwart”), pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act, S.S. 2002, c.C-11.1, as a result of the preliminary decision of the quasi-judicial board rendered July 9, 2007, and the final decision of the quasi-judicial board rendered December 15, 2008, confirming the demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert (the “City”), with certain conditions.
At para. 34 of that decision, Lane J.A. stated:
Further, although there may be little doubt the appellants were aware of the issues and the many complaints given the prior extensive meetings, it does not follow they knew the case they had to meet as the earlier complaints had not led to demolition order.
[2] In accordance with s. 329(1)(a) of The Cities Act, the quasi-judicial board (the “board”) was established, consisting of five members of city council who were not on city council as of November 29, 2004, being the date of the original appeal of the November 18, 2004 demolition order.
The board heard submissions on behalf of Markwart’s legal counsel and on behalf of the City with respect to preliminary matters.
Therefore the Board does not intend to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they consider relevant on these questions.
The board’s finding that the demolition order was appropriate is reasonable finding for the board to have made.
[22] In summary, this appeal must be dismissed on all grounds.","The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property.
Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant.
HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
The board's order is confirmed.
Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order.
The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified.
1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board.
The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet.
No error of law has been committed.
2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him.
3) There is no evidence of bias.
Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours.
There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","[7, 6, 130, 0, 15, 119, 28, 14]"
1048,"1) will get right to the point: with only very rare exception, communications designed to settle legal disputes cannot be disclosed to the Court unless both parties agree.
2) The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute.
ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and now render my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before the Court.
3) Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement.
Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason.
4) do not intend to engage in lengthy discussion of settlement privilege because the law is quite clear and am bringing nothing new to the table: no extension of the law; no epiphany or novel approach just brief refresher for those who seem to have forgotten.

12) Only rarely should the Court be advised of settlement negotiations and such will be even more rare in chambers applications.
Costs can be pursued with vigour after trial if either of the parties is of such mind.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children.
The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner.
The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal.
HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it.
The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it.
The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.","[5, 0, 67, 10, 69, 6, 11, 18, 13]"
