The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases.

As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage.

The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole.

The Court found that the force used by the respondent in the execution of his duty was excessive on an objective basis. The trial judge failed to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the force was necessary, whether the level of force was reasonable in all of the circumstances, and whether the respondent's response to the assault was reckless. The appeal court judge erred by applying the wrong standard of appellate review.  2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary, the Court should not expect an accused person to weigh that force to nicety. 3) The court found that it was common ground that the principles set out in the Code govern the use of force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest and they apply to police officers.

The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The Court found that the police conducted an unreasonable search and that the accused breached his rights for about 11 minutes, by not informing the officer of the reason for his detention and by not giving him his right to contact counsel.

The accused was asked by the police officer if he had any further dealings with him. The police officer told the accused that he was being detained for a possible hit and run or impaired driving charge because he was sure the accused was the driver of the vehicle.

HELD: 1) The Court concluded that the detention was not arbitrary, the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for further investigation. However, an officer who detains for investigative purposes must inform the accused of the reasons for detention and must also give to him his rights to counsel without delay. 2) The exclusion of the evidence from the search and seizure was a breach of the Accused's right to be free from an unreasonable seizure. It was a warrantless search and it was unjustified, unreasonable and illegal.","[10] The officers handcuffed Mr. Keil and searched him, retrieving a fob that operates the locks on the doors of a vehicle and some keys from the Accused’s pocket.

d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","HELD: This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in interpretation of the evidence and calculation of damages. There was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement. The appellant had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the cost of which was small part of the claim. The Learned Trial Judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the double-ply. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge. The law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge, whose authority depends upon that presumption. 2) While the test for judicial impartiality is stringent, the Court should not err in the admission of expert evidence. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case. The decisions concerning the manner in which individual proceedings are conducted are best left to the judge. 3) In the classic case of R. v. Mohan, [2007] SCC 33 (CanLII), the Court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. 4) In this case, the appellant had the necessary experience in respect to foundation and structural repair that he could give expert evidence as to not only the type of foundation repair but also the need for structural repair.","[1] This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012.

They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The Crown called no evidence. The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to support a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt.  2)The Court of Appeal relied on s. 651(3) of the Code. Where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or his counsel is entitled to address the jury last but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is required to address that same location. The Court also considered whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no-evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court.  3)There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the appellants' argument that the 'other inculpatory evidence' of motive and hostility, which put the present case into the category of one where'something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice'.","Appeal Dismissed: 3 October 1994 (orally) The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the
evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no
evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial
judge\'s verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court
either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the
evidence and, on the basis of the Yebes v. The Queen
(1987), 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) and pursuant to s.
686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, ought to be set aside. As to the need for expert evidence to pinpoint the
cause of the injuries suffered by the victim, the question
is readily resolved by examining the circumstances
immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, by
the description of the injuries given by the victim, (who,
although he did not remember how the injuries were
inflicted, had a very good recollection of their nature) by
looking at the photographs of the victim taken the
following day, by the opinions of both the counterman at
the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the
injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the
investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after
that. In either case the
circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient to
sustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. The traditional entitlement to present argument to a judge

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Courteither unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of Yebes v. The Queen, the Court of Appeal held that the evidence did not yield up any other reasonable inferences. 2) The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. They relied on s. 651(3) of the Code which provides that the question of identity was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, by the description of the victim's injuries by the witness (the counterman at the 7-Eleven), by the opinions of both the police and the investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted. The testimony in that respect was highly tentative and could not form an evidentiary base for reasonable inference. 3) The appellants failed on the procedural point. 4) The Circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient tosustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion.",0.16666666666666669

termination of the tenancy on July 31, 1994 (as opposed to
some earlier date). The
rentalsman has a discretion to determine those cases where

The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants on August l993. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. On March 21, 1994 the landlord served the tenants with a notice of terminating of tenancy. The deputy rentalsman who conducted the hearing on this first complaint released his decision on the landlord's application for possession. The Deputy rentalsman did not direct the landlord from unauthorized visits or direct the removal of a particular clause in the tenancy agreement but chose instead to refer the parties to the appropriate provisions in the Residential Tenancies Act.

9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.

The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment.

Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage.

However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits.

The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse.

The Court also held that spousal and child support should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee's report and Recommendations on Child Support. 2)The respondent was granted custody with reasonable access to the petitioner upon reasonable notice.

The respondent's income was $52,000, which was in excess of the amount recommended by the court. 3)The court found that the respondent should retain the goods in her or his possession without further adjustment.

of valuation in this case. Given the
relative income of the parties as well as current income tax
implications, I find the amount of $600.00 per month per child
to be reasonable and fair. In the result, John should pay Mary spousal
maintenance in the sum of $800.00 per month until June 1,
2001. 4.That John Cameron Haley shall pay Mary Helene Haley spousal

Given the relative income of the parties as well as current income tax implications and the economic disadvantage suffered by Mary, the termination and retirement method was the route to go in this case.

The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her.

Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At 1:42 a.m., a roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the roadside breathalyser test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample for analysis. The accused refused and the officer read from his 'card' when making the demand and again when making a breath analysis demand; he read those demands from that card when giving his evidence. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached and the only appropriate remedy was stay of proceedings and costs.  1) The accused was qualified to give expert testimony concerning the operation of the breathalyzer machine used, the quality of the solution, its reliability and the effect of alcohol on human brain function. 2) There was no issue to determine until the Certificate of Analyses was filed and the pertinent evidence was heard. 3) It was not necessary that this be a 'live issue' or does the defence have an absolute right to this disclosure and does it follow that failure to produce the standard alcohol solution calls for a judicial stay or costs? 4) It is the duty of the Crown to make timely disclosure to the defence of all evidence supporting innocence or mitigating the offence. The Crown plays an essential role in the truth-finding function of our system. The need to develop all the relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments or verdicts were to be fashioned on partial or speculative presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence it must depend upon full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence. Accordingly, our approach with respect to the production and discovery of objects or material for independent testing must comport with that fundamental notion.  5) The Court was not impressed with the testimony of the accused and reject it. There is never any one reason for rejecting the evidence of a witness. The evidence of the Accused was straightforward and reliable.","CHARGES [1] Trent Wayne Walker was charged with i) impaired driving, contrary to sections 255(1) and 253(a) and ii) having consumed alcohol in a concentration exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood, operating a motor vehicle, contrary to sections 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code. ISSUES 1) Should the Court enter a stay of proceedings and award costs given the failure of the Crown to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the Defence? 3) Did the Arresting Officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample?

The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.

Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian.

SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage which did not constitute a 'listed peril' as defined by the policy. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the appellant. He gathered the information from the homeowners, reviewed the existing coverage, and completed the application. He did not ask to see the policy nor did he contribute to the amount of the judgment payable to the Homeowner.

8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union, SEIU-West, represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities and their affiliates. The plaintiff union represents approximately 10,000 Health Care Workers. The current collective bargaining agreement covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The tentative agreement was reached on August 13, 2010 and ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010. However the formal CBA, very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs concede that the court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue based on the CBA and the Weber principle. They contend however that the statement of claim, while it does not assert a viable cause of action, can nevertheless serve as a platform for the present application for mandatory injunctive relief. HELD: The motion to strike was dismissed.  1) It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make retroactive adjustment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. The results of such solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. 2) As to the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for interlocutory relief. More particularly, if the court were to encroach on the arbitration process in the way that has been proposed by the plaintiffs the result would be inconsistent with the determination of the Supreme Court in the Weber case that the model of overlapping jurisdiction is no longer to be followed.","The retiring employee’s pension is accordingly reduced. In the statement of claim and in their motion the plaintiffs seek:


(1) a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year;
(2) in the alternative, a mandatory interlocutory injunction to compel the defendants to make the payments before the end of this year on a “best approximation” basis; [12] Accordingly the defendants’ motions to strike are dismissed. [15] The defendants submit that, whatever the proper forum for the plaintiffs to obtain relief, the plaintiffs have not asserted a prima facie case, certainly not a strong prima facie case. The plaintiffs have not persuaded me that there is a strong prime facie case. There may well be, as contended on behalf of the plaintiffs, a serious issue to be arbitrated but for the purposes of the present application I find that it is not adequately framed in the pleadings and in the evidence before me to meet the applicable test.

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his right knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff was attending to pick up lumber and other materials for a job on which he was working. He was unable to fully participate in the business and, as a result, suffered loss in that he was required to hire other persons to carry out some of his tasks. The court awarded the plaintiff $5,000.00 by way of general damages. HELD: The plaintiff had suffered an injury; the injury restricted his activities during the remainder of 1995 and to lesser extent the following year and to very limited extent, continues to the present. The unusual danger could easily have been avoided by instructing employees to ensure they were not placed in such positions as to constitute hidden obstructions.","[1] The plaintiff injured his right knee when he tripped over a “dolly-cart” while attending at the premises of the defendant, J.D. Irving Limited, doing business under the firm name and style of Kent Building Supplies (herein “Kent”) at Bayers Lake Business Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia. [27] In the context of the present circumstances, it is also clear that the presence of a “cart” or “dolly” out of view would also be an “unusual danger”, notwithstanding knowledge of the presence of such dollies within the premises. [35] Recognizing the defendant has not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and that the plaintiff failed to use reasonable care for his own safety, I assess the plaintiff as 60 percent and the defendant 40 percent responsible for the injuries and damages suffered by the plaintiff. DAMAGES [36] The plaintiff says the injuries he sustained to his knee resulted in his knee being swollen with infection, and that he had to endure considerable pain and discomfort for a substantial period following the accident. I would therefore award the plaintiff the sum of $8,500.00 by way of general damages. With respect to loss of income, the plaintiff claims for the difference in the wages for the equivalent period in 1995 as compared to 1994 and, in addition, claims a diminishment in earning capacity. Therefore, there is no basis to sustain a claim for diminishment in earning capacity and, as such, no amount is herein awarded. [42] With regard to the evidence as a whole, the realization that some of the loss can be attributed to this accident and recognizing the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation, even where proof of actual amounts may be difficult or indeed impossible, I award the sum of $5,000.00.

Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two counts in the Information alleging contraventions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and the defendant fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and died as a result of his fall. The defendant had the greatest degree of control and authority and he had the ability to create and maintain a safe and healthy workplace. However, the defendant bore a very high degree of moral blameworthiness and the appropriate range of fine and creative sentencing options was significantly lower than the range recommended by the Crown.","Firstly, that he failed to ensure that a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to Section 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations and Section 17(1) of the Act. Secondly, that he failed to ensure that a guardrail was constructed or installed as required by Section 9(2)(d) of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations, Section 17(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and in both cases, he thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 74(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He suffered serious injuries, and a short time later, he died as a result of those injuries. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislative safety measures. With respect to the mid-rail, I found that he instructed a labourer to install a mid‑rail, but for some reason that worker did not do so. I have no doubt that the actions of that worker contributed to the hazard of Mr. Myles working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. [48] With respect to the top-rail, Mr. Eagles turned his mind to that issue, but I held that he made an error in judgment in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang above the sidewalk could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case. [55] Looking at those cases compared to this case and bearing in mind principles of proportionality and parity, Mr. Eagles did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused Mr. Myles to fall off the work platform. [60] Having carefully reviewed all of the sentencing purposes and principles, which form the basis for my decision, and also factors such as parity, proportionality and restraint, I find that the degree of Mr. Eagles’ moral blameworthiness would be at the lower end of a continuum. 1.

Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children.

The Court found that the applicants had not made sufficient progress to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order.

The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for negligence is subject to the two year time limitation period in s. 3(1)(d)(i) of the LAA. Even though the claim is based on events said to have occurred over 50 years, the 2 year limitation period must be calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. It may well be impossible from practical standpoint for the plaintiff to establish, by balance of probabilities, that he did not discover, or should not with reasonable diligence have discovered, the wrongful nature of the Federal Crown's acts and the nexus between those acts and his injuries. As such, the 12 month time limitation in the POPA does not apply.  1) The language of s. 24(1) is clear and its meaning unambiguous. Even if the time limitation is removed, time begins to run under s. 2(1(a) of The Exchequer Court Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury and damage ceased. 2) Any claims arising from acts or omissions that fall within the scope of s3(3.1) cannot succeed in this court under the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act.

The plaintiff’s claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are set aside by s3(3) of LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3.1.

The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953.

The Attorney General acknowledges that Helen Greyeyes was employed at the Residential School from 1927 to 1969. The parties agree that she died in 1988. 2) The language of s. 24(1) of the LAA is clear and unambiguous. Even if the time limitation period in the POPA applies to claims other than those described in s. 3(1)(a), time begins to run under s. 2(3.2) of this Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury and damage ceased. 3) The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior to June 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims arising from acts or omissions that occurred prior to that date.  4) Although the decision in [R.J.G.] is consistent with various other cases, the Attorney General's submission on the narrower ground that this Court has a jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon any cause or action that is governed by a limitation period pursuant to s. 19(c) of The Exchequer Court Act or its successor legislation, the Federal Court Act. 5) The wording of the Limitation and Proceedings Act (LAA) was clear and its meaning unambiguous, even if the limitation period was removed in 1938 the limitation was removed. The plaintiff’s claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are set aside by s3(3) of LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3.1. The Limitation of Actions Act does not create causes of action, but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. It should therefore be left to the trial judge to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability.","[2] The Attorney General of Canada (the “Attorney General”) applies to strike out the plaintiff’s claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. Although Haines J. in M.C.C. v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, decided that a provincial court has no jurisdiction to entertain any claim against the Federal Crown arising from acts or omissions that predate May 14, 1953, my decision is based on the narrower ground that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain claims arising from the intentional torts of officers and servants of the Crown occurring before the proclamation of the Crown Liability Act on May 14, 1953.

c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant brought a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the plaintiff's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis. HELD: The Court awarded costs in the amount of $3,500 to the defendant.  1)There was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. 2)The circumstances and factual findings justified an increase in the tariff for party/party costs. Further the circumstances warranted an award for Solicitor/client costs in a limited amount. 3)The Defendant's pre-motion brief was relevant in regard to the determination of costs. On the merits of the case, whether there was an implicit agreement regarding the discovery in July including the order of witnesses, as was suggested by the Plaintiff during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery. 4)The plaintiff did not have any authority for the proposition to exclude the defendant's representative from the discovery of the plaintiff’s witnesses.  5)The court reviewed the circumstances of the motion and found that the plaintiff had made an improper use of the subpoena. 6)Rule 77.03(2) and Rule 77.12(1) were applicable. 7)The Court was of the view that the comments in the Defendants pre-trial motion were unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. The Court had the discretion to increase the tariff depending upon the circumstances. 8)The costs awarded were in keeping with the length of the hearing.","Summary: The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the Defendant’s witnesses.

 (1) The issuing of the discovery subpoenas (which in effect dictated the order of witnesses) made exclusion a mute issue. DECISION [41] It is my determination that the Tariff C costs should be increased. While falling short in my decision of finding that the issuing of the discovery subpoenas was an abuse of process, I did find that their issuance was an improper step in these circumstances. In addition, this required the Defendant to take a step in the proceeding it would not otherwise have had to take, the Motion to Strike. On the whole I am of the view that the comments in the Defendants pre-trial motion were unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. [53] On the merits of the case, whether there was implicit agreement or otherwise, these allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which undoubtedly caused the Defendant’s counsel to expend additional time preparing a response.

The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief.

4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about a variety of matters including, but not limited to, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home, and the division of family property. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the application was not in any way intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial. The Court found that it was an error in principle, and reversible error, to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of an order of the Court. It was also inconsistent with the purpose and intention of the foundational Queen's Bench Rules.","1.

The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature.

d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil. The option was exercised in 1973 and a fee simple title was issued to the plaintiff in 1973. The title was encumbered by,inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The action was based upon s. 237 of The Land Titles Act which provides that a person employed to buy land for another takes the title in his own name, his certificate of title is no defence against the rightful owner. He is merely trustee for him, and the Court will enforce the trusts unless the rights of the bona fide purchaser in the meantime intervene. This and similar cases were summarized in V. Di Castri, Q.C., in the following way: In any event, it was never intended that a registered owner, merely by exhibiting a title, should be able to escape the performance of contracts he had entered into prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the registration of his interest, or to deny trusteeship which may be fastened upon him by law. On its face it appears that the section has the effect of enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the owner of known but unregistered interest in land even in the face of contrary contractual obligation as between the purchaser and his vendor. It affords no protection to registered owner against equitable rights which he himself has created and is not a defence when his title is attacked by person rightfully entitled to the land.","The option was exercised and a fee simple title was

The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.

It is quite impossible to give a precise and inclusive definition of the term'residing' which is highly flexible and its many shades of meaning vary not only in the contexts of the United States but also in the jurisdictions of the foreign country. The time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication. 2)The term 'ordinarily resident' is not defined in the Act so turn to case law for assistance.","But because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota, that is to say, its activities in sales, the logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a business address.

Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied.

The appellants had alleged that the respondent 'negligently or fraudulently' misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that they sold to them. Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract. Twin Mountain Construction (the appellants) claimed that because the property was materially less than the size it was represented to be, its plans to extract sand or develop the property were negatively affected. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. 1)Civil Procedure Rule 14.24 provides that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. 2)The appellants were entitled to know the amount of the claim for general damages based upon expected profit from the development of property and/or the excavation of the sand. They could not file a defence until such information was provided. It was difficult to conceive of what additional information they need at this stage. The respondent has specified the type of damages that it seeks. 3)The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as whole. There are other Rules (for example Rules 18, 19 and 20) which can be utilized by the respondents to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.  4)The matter on appeal is an inter-locutory decision of a Chambers judge. The standard of review is simple but stringent one. This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result. 5)The Chambers judge erred at law by ordering better particulars of the general damage claim, which were generally not ordered unless necessary to enable the defendant to plead.","Held: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Bateman, J.A.; [2] In an action initiated in the Supreme Court, Twin Mountain Construction (the respondent) has claimed that Norma Milne and Murray Tweedie (the appellants) “negligently or fraudulently” misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that the appellants sold to the respondent.

HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT.

In addition to numerous clauses in the agreement setting out the rights and obligations of the parties, the respondent agreed that breach by him of any of the provisions of the agreement may cause the company great and irreparable injury and damage which cannot be reasonably compensated in damages in any action in law and the contractor hereby expressly agrees that the company shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breach or recurrence of breach.  1) In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (1) there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (2) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; (3) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief.  4) The respondent was registered representative of the applicant and entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement whereby the respondent would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of a competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause by carrying on the same business on his own. That part of the order may issue. 5) During argument counsel for the applicant abandoned the relief sought in paragraph (iii). This leaves the issues raised in paragraph(ii) of the draft order to be resolved.  6) Counsel for the respondent relies on the decision in Height of Excellence Financial Planning Group Inc. v. Stanley Eric Dixon, [1999] S.J. No. 629 (QL); 1999 SKQB 101 (Q.B.) as support for the position that the application should be denied.","[1] The plaintiff, referred to as “TFPG”. seeks an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to:

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses.

One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, except for jewellry and personal clothing, to be divided among them. He effectively stated that he was leaving his assets to'my child Jane, my child Nancy, and my child Richard'. HELD: 1)The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child rather than a class gift. The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in J.D.'s Will. Counsel have urged the Court to find that Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention. In that clause, the judge underlined the words'solely and absolutely'. The underlining of the two words solely and absolutely and the direction that such inheritances 'is not to form part of matrimonial assets' shows that he has included or excluded members of the class by name. 2)The Court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put itself into the 'armchair' of a testator.  3)Section 31(d) of the Act provides for a general rule that a person's gift falls into the residue expressly subject to contrary intention, i.e. to be shared by all persons falling within the general or generic description and to exclude anyone not then alive. It appears that the Court has found for or against the characterization of gift as class gift depending on the effect such finding will have. In this case, the Court may find gift is class gift to prevent lapse should one or more members of a class predecease him.","Jane was a child of John Donald Mitchell (“J.D.”) who died on December 23, 1999, in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada (Royal Bank), and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as Mr. Compain received an accident injury settlement from SGI. This part of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant was dismissed. HELD: 1)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to the plaintiff and its general banking practices including its report to Equifax as a credit reporting agency. 2)There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon the equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. 3)In conclusion none of the counter-claimant's claims are upheld and they are dismissed in total.","The Royal Bank requested a written assignment of those settlement proceeds, however, Mr. Compain declined to give an assignment. The Royal Bank replied that the were unable to direct Equifax to do so, however, they were in a position to require Equifax to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming that the arrears and default were generated as a result of Mr. Compain's automobile accident, that he had undertaken to pay the Royal Bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement and once the loans were paid out that Mr. Compain had complied with his undertaking to the Royal Bank and settled his debt. 2. If the Royal Bank of Canada is found liable for a breach of contract, fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality what damages, if any, are appropriately awarded against the Royal Bank in favour of Mr. Compain? [13] I conclude that Mr. Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. This part of Mr. Compain's claim against the Royal Bank is dismissed. Assuming, without deciding the point, that banks, much like an insurance company dealing with insureds, do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, I nevertheless conclude, based upon the facts and evidence proven at trial, that the Royal Bank did not breach such duties in their dealings with Mr. Compain.

2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date.

The accused tended to answer questions by resorting to what he normally does and was not able to state what he specifically did on the morning in question. 2) The defence evidence lacks reliability.

b_2016skqb162.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","The respondent argued the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act. The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). The appellant argued it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed. HELD: The appeal was allowed to proceed. 1) The transcript may now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits. The setting of the appeal date is confirmed.  2) The appellant did not see the letter from Transcript Services. It would require conclusion the appellant must go behind both the practice of Transcript Services and the correspondence from the appellant. The appellant must check that the interoffice mail system has not malfunctioned. 3) In interpreting s. 123(1), the ordinary meaning of the words of that provision must be read in the context of the Act as whole and in the Context of Part VIII in particular. It is important to keep in mind the purpose of the act and the legislature's intention in enacting the provision. The provision is benefit conferring and accordingly must be given a broad and purposive interpretation. It must also be interpreted in a manner that will not lead to absurdities.  4) The appeal is to be struck without the appellant having done anything incorrectly. This necessarily means it cannot sit on its hands and allow delay to build without any consequence. Rather, by putting the onus on the appellant to do what it is required to do, the Legislature is assured of speedy small claims process. This achieves one of the principle goals of the entire small claims system of administering justice. 5) In those cases where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant, the legislation provides this Court with the ability to exercise a discretionary remedy to fix that flaw and ensure justice is done as between the parties. This discretionary remedy is set out in ss39(9). That subsection provides for remedy in the event a transcript cannot be provided for the appeal.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.

The third parties brought an application to the court to be allowed to defend the liability of the government of Saskatchewan at trial. An order was made, and the third party parties were permitted to defend against the government at the trial.

The Saskatchewan Government has joined the cementing contractors as third parties. HELD: Even if Husky was not liable to pay the PST in the amount of $393,289.73 it was entitled to refund of PST on materials consumed by third parties pursuant to the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax Act. 1) Even if the Government was not responsible for the PST paid by Husky, the Government properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff on the sale of the tangible personal property pursuant to section of The Provincial Sales tax Act and Regulations thereto. 2) There was no mistake of law in the payments of PST made by the parties to Husky. 3) Husky's amended statement of claim is without merit because the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to its contracts between the second party contractors and Husky Oil.  4) The third party contractor denies the allegations contained in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim dated March 26, 2002, the Defendant's Reply to the Demand for Particulars dated May 9, 2003 and the Plaintiff's Amended Statement of claim amended July 20, 2005. 5) The plaintiff is not entitled to judgment against the Defendant.

The third party contractor remitted the PST to the plaintiff in the amount of $419,964.69, plus interest as alleged in the Third Party Claim. HELD: 1) Even if the Government is entitled to payment of PST from the Saskatchewan Government, it is liable to pay it in undetermined amounts on materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. The Contractor properly levied and collected tax on the sale of the tangible personal property pursuant to s. 57(10(b) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act and the Regulations thereto. 2) The plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the defendant cementing and reservoir service contractors on the well construction contracts. It was not statutorily entitled to refund the PST. 3) The Government was not responsible for the payment of the PST by the defendant. 4) The court found that even if the government was liable to refund PST, the second party contractors owe the S. 50(2) of the Revenue and Finance Act. The court also found that the Government's claim for refund was without merit. 5) The Court found that there was no mistake in the payments of PST made by the parties. 6) There was no error in the parties' representations and interpretations in collecting, remitting and remitting the PST from them. The fact that the parties paid PST in error was not the fault of the Government. 7) The claim against the defendant was barred by s. 50 of The Tax Act and The Limitation of Actions Act. In addition, the plaintiff was not entitled to any refund of s. 56(4) or s. 58(1)(a) of S.S.C. 1985. 8) The defendant was not liable for any sales tax paid by the plaintiff during the claim period.","[1] The plaintiff, Husky Oil Operations Limited, seeks refund from the defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Saskatchewan, of Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax it paid on well cementing contracts it had with the third parties, Sanjel Corporation, Trican Well Services Ltd. and BJ Services Company Canada for the period of 1996 to 2001. For these reasons, we must deny your refund request. For these reasons, we must deny your refund request. Husky has failed to establish that the agreements did not carry out the parties’ intentions.

The appellant was disqualified from driving a motor vehicle at the time of the accident and was sentenced to serve 90 days on an intermittent basis, placed on probation for 2 years, with conditions, required to perform 100 hours of community service and prohibited from operating a vehicle for three years. HELD: Appeal allowed and sentence varied to 6 months for the offence. 1)The appellant must be made to realize that he cannot mix drinking and driving. His prior record is anything but promising. While he recognized the respondent was charged with a serious offence from which the general public needs protection, he was not prepared to incarcerate the respondent and thereby take him out of the work force. 2)The appeal was allowed.",0.188034188034188

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff.

This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Human Rights Code. The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. 1)While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights it proclaims. The essential issue is whether s. 25 of the Act prevents the complainants from having their allegations of sexual harassment decided under the Code. 2)A collective agreement, which requires all differences between the parties to collective agreement to be settled by binding arbitration, takes priority over the Code and ousts the jurisdiction of a Board of inquiry established pursuant to the Code to inquire into and determine whether an alleged act of discrimination occurred. 3)A board of inquiry is not a public body but an arbitrator appointed under the terms of the agreement. 4)The parties agreed there would be no discrimination against anyone because of race, religion, creed, colour, marital status, sex, ancestry or place of origin, nor by reasons of non-membership or non-activity in the Association. 5)The collective agreement is a public statute and it constitutes public policy in Ontario as appears from the reading of the Statute itself and as declared in the preamble. It is clear from the authorities, both in Canada and in England, that parties are not competent to contract themselves out of the provisions and that contracts having such effect are void, as contrary to public policy. 6)The fact the parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in their collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of this complaint. The only method of enforcement of the substantive rights based upon breach of s. 16(1) of the Code that was merely the legal characterization. 7)The only method to resolve a fundamental human right which employees and the union need not bargain and cannot contract out of is by arbitration. 8)The mere fact the Act took precedence over the Act does not change the fact that the dispute is a dispute involving the interpretation, application, or violation of collective agreement;","Appeal Allowed: 15 April 1999 [10] The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment: a board of arbitration appointed pursuant to the terms of the collective agreement or a Board of Inquiry appointed pursuant to the Code. To answer that question one must resolve a number of sub-questions:
a) what are the statutory schemes under the Act and the Code for resolving disputes of this nature?
b) what has the Supreme Court of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law?
c) what is the essential character of the dispute and the ambit of the collective agreement?
d) does either the Code or the Act have the exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute?
e) if the answer to d) is no, which statute takes priority or is paramount? [16] While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. [17] Finally, the mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. [33] In my opinion the ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation and not one which only involves a dispute by the parties concerning the application, violation or interpretation of the collective agreement. In the result the order of the Court of Queen’s Bench is set aside and the matter remitted to the Board of inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions under the Act. Appeal Allowed: 15 April 1999 The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement.",0.43341404358353514,"HELD: The appeal was allowed.

Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty.

Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cannabis marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded from the search. The accused argued that his statement to the police was voluntary and the police had not proven that the officer had reasonable grounds for the search of his person. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the accused was not detained and, therefore, no police duty under the Charter was triggered prior to arrest. There was no evidence of what he was thinking prior to his arrest. The Court also held that there was no breach of the accused's s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights. The court found that the police officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon an inference based upon observation (i.e., smell) the smell of burned marijuana, which was not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present.","[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights.

When the officer asked if he had any other drugs on his person, the accused indicated that he had dropped them at the mall. The police stopped the accused outside the courthouse and searched him and his vehicle. There was no police caution and the officer smelled the marijuana. The statement of the accused to the police was found to be free and voluntary. The Court found no violation prior to the officer giving his statement to police. HELD: The Court held that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds rather than on an inference that more, un-smoked marihuana will be present.  1) The Court accepted the defence’s argument that, to find someone committing an offence, the arresting officer has to show something beyond those rather unremarkable abilities. There were other possible explanations for the smell of cannabis in the truck other than that of a cigarette, other than smoking cannabis, which was the only source of the smell. Such an inference will not always be objectively reasonable. 2) There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire. The decision was not dependant on the issue of whether the officer had sufficient basis for arrest. The facts were not in dispute.","[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights.

In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The accused was stopped by police on foot patrol on the sidewalk near the courthouse. The officers noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused's person. They approached the accused and observed him smoking a cigarette. The officer asked the accused where the marijuana was coming from and he answered that it was from the inside of the vehicle. When the officer asked if he had any other drugs on his person, the accused indicated that he had dropped them at the mall. The police stopped the accused outside the courthouse and searched him and his vehicle. There was no police caution and the officer smelled the marijuana. The statement of the accused to the police was found to be free and voluntary. The Court found no violation prior to the officer giving his statement to police. HELD: The Court held that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds rather than on an inference that more, un-smoked marihuana will be present.  1) The Court accepted the defence’s argument that, to find someone committing an offence, the arresting officer has to show something beyond those rather unremarkable abilities. There were other possible explanations for the smell of cannabis in the truck other than that of a cigarette, other than smoking cannabis, which was the only source of the smell. Such an inference will not always be objectively reasonable. 2) There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire. The decision was not dependant on the issue of whether the officer had sufficient basis for arrest. The facts were not in dispute.","[2] The defense have alleged a violation of the accused’s section 8 and section 9 Charter rights. The defense have also contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to the police. Although there was no police caution, I find that his statement has been proven to be free and voluntary. [19] The statement of Mr. Stone to the police occurred before Mr. Stone was detained, and, therefore, before the triggering of a police duty to advise him of his rights. I find no section 10(b) violation prior to Mr. Stone’s statement to the police. [53] In my view, the facts or circumstances known to the arresting officer at the time of arrest provide a sufficient basis to conclude, and I do conclude, that the officer’s subjective belief that Mr. Stone was in possession of marihuana was objectively reasonable. Therefore, I find that Constable Lynch had the authority to arrest for present possession of marihuana pursuant to section 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. I accept the evidence of Constable Lynch and find that the search of Mr. Stone was incident to his arrest and for the lawful purpose of securing evidence. [54] I am not satisfied that the accused’s section 8 or section 9 rights under the Charter were violated. However, without going into great detail, let me say that, if I had found a breach of the accused’s section 8 and/or section 9 rights, a section 24 analysis would have resulted in a decision not to exclude the evidence given due to:


(a) the seriousness of the charges facing the accused;
(b) there being no bad faith on the part of the police;
(c) the evidence not being conscriptive; and
(d) the fact that the accused could have been lawfully arrested for admittedly having violating the condition to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. [57] The motion to exclude the accused’s statement to the police is denied. [58] The motion to exclude the results of the search of the accused’s person is denied.",0.14930015552099532,"The accused was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cannabis marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded from the search. The accused argued that his statement to the police was voluntary and the police had not proven that the officer had reasonable grounds for the search of his person. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the accused was not detained and, therefore, no police duty under the Charter was triggered prior to arrest. There was no evidence of what he was thinking prior to his arrest. The Court also held that there was no breach of the accused's s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights. The court found that the police officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon an inference based upon observation (i.e., smell) the smell of burned marijuana, which was not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present.",0.14367816091954022

b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule.

The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property.

The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had complete control of the two workers but that he chose not to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters. He also failed to take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for on the worksite. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of seven offences. The essential facts of the case are not in dispute and they are fairly straight-forward. The defense objected to the admission into evidence of remedial progress report that was simply marked for identification pending the ruling of the court.

The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances.

HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met.

1995 and resulted in a decree nisi of divorce and an order
granting Tracy custody of Sophie. The custody order was
appealed and the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances for Sophie and her parents since the
first trial have created a materially different factual
context than the one presented to the trier of fact in the
first trial. norms. Consequently, Sophie\'s doctor in early 1996 referred
Sophie to the Alvin Buckwold Child Development Centre at the
Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon where she was diagnosed
as experiencing global development delay. In recognition of
Sophie\'s needs, Lorne has moved to the City of Saskatoon
because the Buckwold Centre is the only facility in
Saskatchewan that offers the specialized attention Sophie
requires. Because of
his employment disability, he remains available to provide
full-time care for Sophie and exhibits a very strong desire to
do so. Each parent is a capable caregiver. Accordingly, I award Lorne custody of Sophie. 
Tracy will have weekly access to Sophie on two non-consecutive
days between 10:00 in the forenoon and 6:00 in the afternoon,

Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

The court also held that there was a breach of the accused's rights under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.  1)In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the accused was not found guilty. 2)The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy were not reliable indicators of impairment. 3)The officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights. However, thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. The officer noted that the accused appeared to be asleep when he grabbed him by the wrist. This latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps he was overtired rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. 4)The Court found that the officer's observations did not provide sufficient evidence for the breath demand. 5)In all criminal cases the trial judge must be satisfied as to a person's guilt beyond reasonable doubt before a conviction can be registered.

The officer's observations of the accused were insufficient to establish reasonable and probable grounds. The evidence was of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that his vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for the accused. He did not observe any problems with balance or walk. 3) The certificate of analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. The admission of it into evidence might well render the trial unfair, and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 4) The accused is not guilty of the charge of impaired driving.  5) The Court reviewed various authorities and found that the evidence of a person sleeping through the two green traffic lights did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the accused was impaired. The Court concluded that it was not necessary to exclude the certificate as there was insufficient evidence for the demand.  6) In light of the evidence, the Court found that there was no breach of s.24(2) of The Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained.","[1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about July 10th, 2000, operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired, and also, operate a motor vehicle while over .08, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. [2] The following issues arose during the trial:
1) Was there a breach of the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained, in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand? If there was a breach, is there a remedy under s. 24(2) of the Charter?
2) Is the evidence sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code? As well, the accused was co-operative throughout, and he did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. As such, I must conclude that the evidence of slurred speech is not reliable. [18] In light of the foregoing, I find that the evidence is sufficient to establish a breach of the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. Specifically, I conclude that the Certificate of Analyses constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. [19] Therefore as well, in the absence of the Certificate of Analyses, the evidence herein is not sufficient to prove the offence under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused is not guilty. Issue: Is the evidence sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code? [21] As mentioned previously herein, I do not regard the evidence of the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. [22] Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot. In the context of Stellato, in my view, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave me with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore, the accused is not guilty of the charge under s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.",0.4470284237726098,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference.

The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act.

The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome.

The chambers judge agreed with the appellant that there had been no contact between the child and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. He agreed that the father was not entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as result of the interplay between s. 67(1)(f) and s. 74(3) of the Act because he had not had contact with the child or provided support to her.

2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product.

The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The only benefit that Triple R received was the opportunity to perform repair work for reward upon the consigned vehicles. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff was not interested in having the vehicle repaired, even if it was possible, in that he had obtained a different vehicle for his daughter. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he incurred for repair and inspection. Triple R did not establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the plaintiff ceratin warranties to the extent that they were reasonable for the use of the product. 2)In the circumstances, the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period. 3)The court found support for the notion that persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser. In the circumstances the actions of the plaintiff must be considered by Triple R. 4)The Court found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1600 plus foreseeable damages.

e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants opposed each of the requests on the basis that they were inappropriate in light of the overall context of the litigation. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendants to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares' nor does it allege that the defendant has any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares. 2)The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does not represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated in s.34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. 3)The affidavit of the plaintiff deposed positively to the facts in question, verifies the cause of action and the amount claimed as due. 4)There was no evidence before the Court to suggest any grounds for believing that the corporation is insolvent as required by s. 34(2). 5)The affidavits of the defendants were examined and the court was of the view that s34(1) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained therein. 6)In the event that this interpretation is wrong, it is also necessary to examine the question of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the corporate defendant has a good defence to, or ought to be permitted to defend, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.","1. An order pursuant to Rule 129 and 133 of The Queen’s Bench Rules of Court, for an order granting the Plaintiff, Margaret Fehr (“Fehr”), summary judgment against the Defendant, Peak Enterprises Inc. (“Peak”), as follows: The amended notice of motion also seeks an order pursuant to Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. 9. Peak is therefore prohibited by subsection 34(2) of The Business Corporation [sic] Act (Saskatchewan) from making any payments to redeem the Plaintiff’s preferred shares. To that end, I observe that the plaintiff’s motion does not require Peak Enterprises Inc. to “make any payment to purchase” or to “redeem any redeemable shares.” [18] I am of the view that s. 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2). In considering all of the material filed on this application, including the cross‑examination of Mr. Beveridge on his affidavit, I am not satisfied that the defendants have demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that there is real insolvency on the part of Peak Enterprises Inc. To that end, I am also mindful of the failure of the defendants to provide responses to the undertakings following from the cross‑examination process which occurred on July 22, 2005. [28] In conclusion on this issue, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has demonstrated an entitlement to summary judgment pursuant to Rule 129 against the defendant Peak Enterprises Inc. for the sum of $214,600.00. Further, the plaintiff is entitled to interest in accordance with the Share Agreement at the rate of 16 percent from March 6, 2005, and the plaintiff shall have judgment for this principal amount and interest against the defendant Peak Enterprises Inc.

The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation.

The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.

Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion dated February 8, 2005, seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items.

The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was owned by him and was the vehicle used by him to acquire the shares of Action Business Machines Limited (ABM). The trial judge awarded direct damages of $1,700,000 representing lost return on alternative investment of $2,000,000 at 10% per annum for seven years. This was the first time the trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the appellant should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements of ABM been correct. This, being the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty, is not the correct test. The first approach was to be preferred as it looked at the company as going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at future date. The second approach is to fix the damages so as to put the appellant as far as possible in his position as he would have been had he not invested in ABM. In particular, the damages are prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the ABM was less than what the appellant paid for it.","THE COURT: The appeal is allowed in part as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Hart and Pugsley, JJ.A., concurring.

e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Phillips Co. lawyers should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. HELD: 1) The sole issue is whether Mervin C. Phillips and the lawyers with Phillips Co.'s law firm are ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against a former client in the same or any related matter. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed to rebut that presumption, the court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless the solicitor satisfies the court that he or she is seeking to continue on with the client. 2) There is an obvious conflict of interests which requires court intervention in the interests of the broader administration of justice. 3) The court reviewed the Alberta case of Jeffers v. Calico Compression Systems, 2002 ABQB 72 where numerous indicia of solicitor-client relationship were discussed. It was hard to fathom that information imparted to the former client was purely procedural and benign in nature and not ultimately relevant to the suit commenced one year later by the defendant.","[23] Based on the whole of the evidence, viewed objectively through the eyes of a reasonable person, I am satisfied the interaction between the Holgates and the lawyers from Phillips & Co. constituted a solicitor-client relationship.

That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is automatic.

Once that former relationship has been established, and once it can be shown that the relationship is sufficiently related to the retainer under challenge, a rebuttable presumption arises in favour of the former.

As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed, the court must presume the Holgins imparted confidential information to the lawyer in that firm.","[23] Based on the whole of the evidence, viewed objectively through the eyes of a reasonable person, I am satisfied the interaction between the Holgates and the lawyers from Phillips & Co. constituted a solicitor-client relationship. As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed to rebut that presumption, I must presume the Holgates imparted confidential information to the lawyers in that law firm. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. DECISION [55] For the aforementioned reasons, the application is granted.",0.35844155844155845,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Phillips and Holgates and the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and Holgate pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is automatic. HELD: 1) There is no evidence that a solicitor-client relationship exists between the law firm and the plaintiffs. The law firm has failed to rebut the presumption that confidential information was imparted to the lawyers in that law firm. 2) In the circumstances where a lawyer purports to conduct litigation adverse to the former client in relation to matter connected to the first retainer, a reasonable person in the position of party with knowledge of all the facts would reasonably form the belief that the lawyer was acting for a particular party. 3) There are no assurances or undertakings not to use the information which will avail.

There was a series of Ontario Superior Court decisions indicating such an issue was not 'appropriate' for jury trial. The trial judge may, in rare cases, take all or part of a trial from the jury after its commencement.

Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted.

Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait.

Both individuals have been in custody since November 2004.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the accused was acquitted of both charges. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge found the accused's suspicion was not reasonable and there being no other reason for detaining him, there was a violation of his rights under s. and s. of the Charter. The trial judge excluded the Certificate of Qualified Technician from the appeal. 2)The Court reviewed the meaning of the s. 24(2) Charter remedy and found that the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the officer to make an approved screening device demand on the accused. There was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact. The Court reviewed R. v. Gunn, 2012 SKCA 80 (CanLII), albeit in the context of a demand pursuant to s24(2).","This is a finding of fact. The trial judge stated he would have expected there to be a smell of alcohol on the breath of the accused if he had recently consumed the beer. As a result, the trial judge disregarded the admission of drinking, and evaluated whether a reasonable person would suspect Mr. Plantje had alcohol in his body on the basis of the careless driving and his red eyes combined with the absence of a smell of alcohol or other signs of recent consumption. It is the opinion of this Court that a reasonable person during a traffic stop after erratic driving, in the early hours of the morning, would perceive the question Cst. Kowalenko asked to be referring to recent consumption of alcohol. A reasonable member of the public would perceive the question to be referring to alcohol consumption that could impair a person's current ability to drive. [40] It was also reasonable for Cst. Kowalenko, despite Cst. Kowalenko's imprecise use of words, to infer from the answer given by Mr. Plantje that Mr. Plantje had consumed three beer at a recent, relevant time. This did not prove that Mr. Plantje had consumed the three beer recently, but it is certainly reasonable for a police officer to infer the consumption was recent, for the purposes of a reasonable suspicion, when such an answer is given by a driver in these circumstances in an unqualified manner. It is this Court's opinion that an admission of drinking by a driver, when questioned by a police officer, provides even stronger support for a suspicion that the driver has alcohol in his body than the generalized smell of alcohol emanating from a car window does. [44] The ASD demand was reasonably made and, therefore, there was no violation of Mr. Plantje's rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. The Crown's appeal must be allowed and a new trial ordered.

Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 527, and [2010] SCC 39 (QLII). The Court found the officer erred when he concluded that the ASD demand satisfied the objective requirement of s. 254(2)(b). The court also found that Cst. Kowalenko based his suspicion on the following three factors: the smell of alcohol, slurred speech and dry mouth, the officer had observed the accused drink three beer that evening, the accused was smacking his lips and tongue as if his mouth was dry, to have dried white saliva in the corners of his mouth, to be slurring his words and to have redshot (sic) and glossy eyes.

The Board argued that the specific created an exception in the general. The wording of s8(1)) of the Education act extends that restriction to the vehicle involved in the accident.

Therefore, the specific creates an exception to the general, and negligent teacher/driver, even acting within the scope of s. 228 of The Education Act, is liable for the injury to the plaintiff pupil. 2)The teacher's immunity under the Education Act extends to the owner of the motor vehicle. This principle of statutory interpretation is applicable to all drivers of motor vehicles. 3)In this case the school board argues that s. 86(1) of the highway traffic act is in conflict because the plaintiff and driver were both ""workers as defined by The Workers' Compensation Act. That distinction is illusory. The parties to the Neault case agreed The Workers Compensation Act applied. In the event the teacher is immune from liability by virtue of s228 of the Act and the co-defendant is liable by operation of the same s86(1)(1) for the personal injuries sustained by the student. 4)The School Board argues that, in this case, the education act is the General statute dealingwith teacher’s liability & immunity and the extent to which the School Board remains liable, even though the teacher might be immune from the liability. The reasoning in Neault to be directly on point is that the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the s.228 of The Act. However, the legislation also provides that negligent teacher, who is only liable to the same amount extent as the driver, is immune to liability if he has acted in the scope thereof. 5)The school board argued that in this particular case the education Act is a general statute, dealing with the teacher”s liability in a specific way. The Board argued that the specific created an exception in the general. The wording of s8(1)) of the Education act extends that restriction to the vehicle involved in the accident. Even if there were an apparent conflict between the two statutes, careful analysis would lead one to conclude that the provisions of the special statute are not construed as repealing the general but as providing an exception. The school board was not entitled to sue the teacher.","This is an application pursuant to Rule 188 of The
Queen's Bench Rules of Court for a determination of these
points of law: Counsel for the School Board argues that, in this
case, The Education Act is the general statute dealing
with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. I cannot agree with this analysis. The injured plaintiff is
not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a
vehicle. On the basis of this analysis and the agreed facts,
I find that Edith Larsen was acting within the scope of
her duties under s. 228 [now s. 232] of The Education
Act.",0.22306238185255198,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court for a determination of whether the defendant is liable for the personal injuriessustained by the infant plaintiff or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Highway Traffic Act. HELD: 1)The Education Act is the general statute governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher when acting within the scope of s.228 of the Education Act. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 2)In the event the teacher is not liable, the school board is only liable to the same extent as the driver. That is, Edith Larsen's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle.",0.34841628959276016
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the parties moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in November 2002 for retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent ultimately countered with an application for variation to this court in March 2004. She also sought a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. Variation of On-going Support for Kimberly [1] This matter is largely because the parties cannot agree on the method of calculating the respondent's income for child support purposes. The parties agree that much of his income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. However, given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of Mr. Marzolf's post-separation income (including his 2003 income) it would be imprudent, even if the parties were together, to enhance Kimberley's standard of living on the basis of a percentage of her father's 2003 income.","[1] Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Madam Justice E.J. Gunn on April 30, 1999. He seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984. On the same basis she also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. [8] Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952.00 realized in the Province of Alberta, child support of $1,186.00 would be payable on the first $150,000.00 of income and a further amount of $742.00 would be payable on the balance for total child support of $1,928.00. It is self-evident that Mr. Marzolf has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does Ms. Marzolf. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parents’ support. Given Ashley’s limited ability to earn income during her short hiatus from school and considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parents to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.

The Tribunal employed the following language in expressing this conclusion: do not find it patently reasonable that the hearing Officer found that the inference the Worker was seeking was not a reasonable one. The inference being sought by the worker is that his knee problem arose out of and in the course of his employment. The medical evidence did not support the inference that the worker was seeking.

3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour.

The mother had made numerous mistakes in her past as a parent and the father was unable to provide adequate support to the children, particularly in the face of ongoing problems with their mental health. The Court was of the opinion that the father had made a mistake in his drug use and that he was contributing to the deterioration of the children's short and long term care."," Pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act A.L.H. applies for a change in the primary care arrangements, and M.R.H. requests a dismissal of the current application to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day to day care and control of the children with him, subject to access times with their mother. However, the boys were not returned to her care, and consequently the mother, shortly after her release from hospital, filed this application for a variation of the primary care and control order. [6] In a nutshell, the mother alleges the children, while in the care of their father, are not receiving suitable or appropriate parenting. [28] There are other examples ( boys missing school, etc. without a valid reason, at the whim of their father) described in the evidence which could be recounted here, but suffice to say individually and cumulatively these various incidents paint a picture of a parent who is unable to meet the needs of his children on a daily basis. Let me say, firstly, if a parent struggling at the poverty level is smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a drug habit, this will automatically divert from already meager funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children. It seems, to me the father has placed a higher priority on his intimate relationship with marijuana, and possibly other drugs, over his primary responsibility as protector of his son. I, furthermore, find the father is not presently providing the physical amenities of life for these two growing boys.

(the father's drug use) and the mother's troubling misconduct both pre- and post-hospitalization have been a concern to the Court. The Court takes absolutely no solace in the fact that they were called to the father's home, but did not proceed with full investigation. The court is concerned that if a parent struggling at the poverty level is smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a drug habit, this will automatically divert from already meager funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children. 4) In the present circumstances, the father is not presently providing the physical amenities of life for these two growing boys.

However, the boys were not returned to her care, and consequently the mother, shortly after her release from hospital, filed this application for a variation of the primary care and control order. [6] In a nutshell, the mother alleges the children, while in the care of their father, are not receiving suitable or appropriate parenting. [28] There are other examples ( boys missing school, etc. without a valid reason, at the whim of their father) described in the evidence which could be recounted here, but suffice to say individually and cumulatively these various incidents paint a picture of a parent who is unable to meet the needs of his children on a daily basis. Let me say, firstly, if a parent struggling at the poverty level is smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a drug habit, this will automatically divert from already meager funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children. It seems, to me the father has placed a higher priority on his intimate relationship with marijuana, and possibly other drugs, over his primary responsibility as protector of his son. I, furthermore, find the father is not presently providing the physical amenities of life for these two growing boys. Therefore, the transfer of primary care to the mother shall be conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions outlined below.

When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","This is a request for variation of the primary care arrangements for two children.

The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed.

The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have received had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the defendant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the Legislature had denied such a claim and provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. The deceased's estate was entitled to claim damages for the loss of his future earning capacity and were recoverable in the survival action. The appellants appealed. The Court held that the legislature had denied the appellants the right to sue for loss of expectation of life and that the only significant claim under the survival of actions legislation was under the Fatal Injuries Act, which excluded causes of action which would have entitled the injured party to sue had he been killed.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [7] The appellants, in their action under the Survival of Actions Act, advance a claim for Paul’s lost earning capacity.

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, Justice Wilson determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to filing the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. The order sets out the history of the relationship between the parties and made several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior. Included in the interim orders were interim orders giving access, child support and spousal support. As well an order releasing the respondent's interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property, subject to accounting at a later date. HELD: The application for stay is dismissed. 1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of such an order obtained after trial. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice. 2) With respect to the secondary test, it is submitted that there are exceptional circumstances making it just and fit that the stay be granted.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT. In early 2008, a major Saskatchewan hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. FCC and National financing is secured by mortgages against the titles to the pig barns. Within a year both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. The applicant, Titan, each acquired several pig-barns formerly owned by Stomp Pork Farm Ltd. at various locations in Saskatchewan. These acquisitions were financed for the respective purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National) as a third mortgagee. In issue was whether the defendant was entitled to plead equitable set-off. The court referred to Rule 104A(1)(c) relating to set-offs and dismissed the application on the basis that the defendant's cross-claim was so closely connected with the plaintiff's demand that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking into account National's defences. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases and where the court is satisfied the claim is devoid all merit. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, although it should not be lightly done, may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done. 2) National has raised reasonable defences including: breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present; National has the right to defend the actions because of its interest in the equity of redemption; there is no basis to imply improper motives. 3) In the meantime FCC as first mortgagee has had to cover substantial ongoing expenses to maintain and attempt to preserve the value of the vacant barns","(4) The present FCC claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three‑year HTP periods (in the case of Titan in May 2012 and in the case of Stomp (2008) in June 2013).

She earns $13,500 per month. She is entitled to spousal support of $1,700 per month for the 7 months after the marriage ended. She has not demonstrated any particular economic hardship arising from the breakdown of the marriage. HELD: The Court valued the husband's interest in the company at $135,982.

her hand at being a part time sales person and at direct home
sales. However, I prefer and
accept the evidence of Roger over Mr. Protz when there is a
variance in their evidence. I consider it appropriate that all the assets be
valued as the same time. On the evidence before me and given my substantial
reservations as to the activities of Mr. Protz herein and as
to the financial statements and records subsequent to the
October 31, 1992 statement I consider it appropriate to value
the assets as of the time of the application. I value Mr. Protz\'s interest in Protz Power Inc. at
$192,727.00 being the mid-point of Mr. Kalesnikoff\'s
valuations. (1)From the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home Mrs.
Protz is to receive the sum of $13,500.00 by way of
equalization for the monies paid out to clear Mr. Protz\'s writ
of execution; A charge in that sum is created against
the matrimonial assets that become Mr. Protz\'s as a result of
my judgment herein. (6)There will be a transfer to Mrs. Protz, by way of spousal
rollover, of monies in Mr. Protz\'s R.R.S.P. and to the extent
of $84,000.00. (7)Settlement proceeds from Mr. Protz\'s claim against J.I.

Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it.

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff had purchased the equipment from Ritchie Bros. for a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) There are indications that the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. The defendants advertised the auction as a farm dispersal auction, and the plaintiff's impending retirement was considered sufficiently noteworthy to merit special mention in the sale fliers under the heading 'Auctioneer's Note'. What constitutes bid indirectly on an owner's behalf or for his benefit is a far more elusive question. 3) The defendants were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by Hodgins Auctioneers Inc. (the plaintiff's former employer). 4) The plaintiff consigned his farm equipment for sale to the highest bidder at the auction. It was not known to the defendants that it was being offered by the plaintiff. 5) There was little in the way of communication between the plaintiff and the defendants after December 23, 2003 when the plaintiff first approached to become a potential customer. 6) There were also some issues of breach of contract, as the plaintiff had not been paid in full. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion was that it had included the full sale price of the equipment when it calculated the gross sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. 7) In the meantime, the plaintiff was attempting to establish itself as a regional presence in the region. The court reviewed the contractual negotiations between the defendant and plaintiff and concluded that they were in breach of the contract. 8) The court was not satisfied with the defendant’s explanation of why the plaintiff bid on the equipment and the court was unable to determine whether it was offered directly or indirectly by the defendant.","2) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.

The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services, a newly formed division of Ritchie Bros. The plaintiff was purportedly retiring from farming and the transaction was in the closing stages at the time the plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In this transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on his behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) The issues in this case have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder, and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. An open and level playing field is critical to the integrity of a clean auction. There are no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated values, no reserves, and no minimums, and in case where an owner is caught in direct attempt to buy back his property or move to a new location, the breach is obvious and the response is swift.

(2) In all other respects, the plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs, to be determined on a solicitor client basis, upon further application by the defendants under Rule 565 as herein directed.",0.18761726078799248,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services, a newly formed division of Ritchie Bros. The plaintiff was purportedly retiring from farming and the transaction was in the closing stages at the time the plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In this transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on his behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) The issues in this case have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder, and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. An open and level playing field is critical to the integrity of a clean auction. There are no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated values, no reserves, and no minimums, and in case where an owner is caught in direct attempt to buy back his property or move to a new location, the breach is obvious and the response is swift.

The defendants advertised the auction as a farm dispersal auction, and the plaintiff's impending retirement was considered sufficiently noteworthy to merit special mention in the sale fliers under the heading 'Auctioneer's Note'. What constitutes bid indirectly on an owner's behalf or for his benefit is a far more elusive question. 3) The defendants were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by Hodgins Auctioneers Inc.

It was not known to the defendants that it was being offered by the plaintiff. 5) There was little in the way of communication between the plaintiff and the defendants after December 23, 2003 when the plaintiff first approached to become a potential customer. 6) There were also some issues of breach of contract, as the plaintiff had not been paid in full. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion was that it had included the full sale price of the equipment when it calculated the gross sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. 7) In the meantime, the plaintiff was attempting to establish itself as a regional presence in the region. The court reviewed the contractual negotiations between the defendant and plaintiff and concluded that they were in breach of the contract. 8) The court was not satisfied with the defendant’s explanation of why the plaintiff bid on the equipment and the court was unable to determine whether it was offered directly or indirectly by the defendant.",0.2399355877616747

4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused had been panhandling with his companion when he was approached by the accused, who was intoxicated and had a knife in his hand. During the confrontation, the accused threw the knife at the complainant and the complainant. The complainant confronted the accused in the parking lot and chased him to his vehicle, where he slashed the complainant's tire on the complainant’s car and then ran away, leaving the complainant to fend for himself in the back alley. When the complainant ran, the complainant grabbed the knife and threw it at him, striking the complainant in the face and causing him to fall backwards into the alleyway. The victim was injured in the confrontation and the accused was arrested. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial, including a security officer who testified that the accused threatened to apply force to him and that the complainant believed the accused had the present ability to use a weapon. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault and the Crown had established that self-defence was not applicable in all of the circumstances established by the evidence given in this case.  1)The accused admitted to the fact that he walked up to the complainant, in close quarters, as the complainant did not touch him. 2)The complainant testified that he was frightened when the accused said something to him that caused him to become upset, go to his dufflebag, retrieve the knife in it (it was 15 inches long and the blade 10 inches), and pursue him as he left, could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force against him, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s. 34(2)(b). 3)The Crown called the accused to give his evidence. The evidence of these witnesses, which will now review, provided the facts and circumstances applicable to reach the appropriate legal result.","1. THAT HE, the said Jay James Drysdale on or about the 7th day of August, A.D. 2014 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did in committing an assault on Simon Brown threaten to use a weapon, to wit: a butcher knife, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code. There is also no question that the Crown has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Criminal Code. [29] I also have no hesitation in finding and concluding that it was Mr. Drysdale who initiated the confrontation between he and Mr. Brown by walking up to him and, in very close quarters, as Mr. Drysdale himself testified, getting into his personal space. [38] When one considers the factors set out in ss. 34(2), I have concluded, in all of the circumstances, that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of Mr. Brown and Mr. Hedstrom, and the words used by Mr. Brown spoken to Mr. Drysdale, were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by Mr. Drysdale against Mr. Brown. I have reached this conclusion for a number of reasons, including the fact that it was Mr. Drysdale who initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with Mr. Brown.

[41] I have concluded that the Crown has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of this case do not give rise to the defence of self-defence.

The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat.

He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation. The appellant is 38 years old and was employed as a long distance trucker by Westcan Bulk Transport. He had no criminal record. His employer advised him that because of the nature of their business and the uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had no choice but to terminate his employment. He appealed the finding of guilt and made a request to substitute discharge for the conviction and although such orders should be made sparingly, they should not be reserved exclusively for trivial or unintentional offences. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Where an accused, other than a corporation, pleads guilty to or is convicted of an offence other than an offence for which minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by life imprisonment, the court may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order. Thus the issue here is whether it is in the interests of both parties and not against the Public Interest to order an absolute discharge. It is clear the appellant may appeal the finding in guilt and make the request for substitute discharge, but there is no evidence to support this. 2)The appellant is not a person requiring personal deterrence and rehabilitation through the use of correctional facilities or treatment centres is not factor.

Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue.

The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appealed an order made by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal was brought under s. 49.21(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The cardiologist had been previously the subject of a competency review ordered by the College of Physicians and Surgeons and was found to be competent to conduct cardiology practice. He had attempted to reduce the limits placed on cardiologists by developing a clinic with staff and diagnostic equipment that was equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital. Many of the tests performed by the cardiologist in his clinic were not reflected in the comparative statistics. He challenged the reliability of these statistics as a fair and meaningful indicator of comparative patient costs. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. The Committee gave lengthy written comments to the appellant. Although the reasons contained in the decision may not have been approved by the Committee, they were not inadequate as alleged and do not constitute breach of natural justice. 2) There was a reasonable apprehension of bias in the Committee's decision-making process. It was necessary to deal with each of the four grounds identified by the case law.  3) The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings of the Committee.","[1] Dr. Huerto, a cardiologist, appeals an order made

Insurance Branch (the ""MCIB""). [2] Dr. Huerto also applies under Part 52 of the Rules
of Court for a judicial review of the proceedings. The first is whether there is a
reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the involvement of
the Director of Professional Review in the hearing conducted
by the Committee. The second is whether there is a reasonable
apprehension of institutional bias raised by the roles of the
Director and the Committee assigned to them by the Act. d. The lack of institutional
independence of the Committee
from the Director and MCIB
raised a reasonable apprehension
of institutional bias. 2. The Committee made the following
errors of law:

a. By improperly placing the burden
of proof on Dr. Huerto;

b. By failing to take into account
all relevant factors in:

i. Ignoring the statistical

Committee in preference to the

its alleged lack of institutional independence from the

evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie
case (or a presumption) that Dr. Huerto\'s billings constituted
a departure from a pattern of medical practice acceptable to
the Committee. issue. [58] With these considerations in mind, I conclude that
the Committee did not err in law in misconstruing
its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis
presented by Dr. Huerto. The overwhelming weight of the evidence presented
to the Committee demonstrated that the MCIB statistics were
flawed as a reliable comparison tool and that the adjusted

Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76.

The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support.

The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months.

If he has overpaid it will be 'clawed back' again, from whomever 'owes' him monies over 3 month payment period. 5)The father's income is based on current income which means his support is based upon current income.

The applicant argues that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. The Board did not rely on policy statement 5 or even mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it. Therefore, even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is an appropriate standard of review for this matter as well. 2) There is no evidence the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana is a 'necessary' or'required' medical aid' under s. 106(1). The Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. 3) There was no evidence that the board made its decision based on considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marijuana. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana was potentially unsafe and unproven. 4) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions the Board is interpreting and applying the Act.

The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded.

The jury found that the accused was not the perpetrator of the crime. The accused was sentenced to nine years incarceration because of parole violations. The court was also to be guided by the principles set out in s. 718.2 of the Code.  1) In a jury trial, the jury does not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction. The sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence in the case. 2) The accused has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. He has, by my count, 67 previous convictions. Most of his convictions relate to thefts and break and enters to commit theft. The offender was also found to be a principal or party in the aggravated assault on the complainant. The Court was to take into account the factors that the jury had identified as essential to convicting the accused. 3) The Court is to be bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury's verdict. The principles of parity in sentencing are set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC (CanLII), [2008] SCC 15, [2013] SKCA 27, 189 Sask.

[124] In sentencing each of Calvin Klemenz and Thomas Matychuk, the circumstances of the offence involved a home invasion and aggravated sexual assault, causing serious bodily harm to a young man. [131] The sentence I am imposing is 12 years of imprisonment for breaking and entering F.J.’s house and committing therein the offence of aggravated sexual assault. I give Calvin Klemenz credit of 22 months and three weeks for the time spent in custody, therefore the sentence to be served is 10 years and five weeks in the penitentiary. [145] The sentence I am imposing with respect to Thomas Matychuk is 12 years of imprisonment for breaking and entering F.J.’s house and committing therein the offence of aggravated sexual assault. I give Thomas Matychuk credit of 19 months and two weeks for the time spent in custody. Therefore, the sentence to be served is 10 years and four and one-half months in the penitentiary. There will be an order under s. 490.012 requiring Calvin Klemenz and Thomas Matychuk each to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, for the duration of 20 years under s. 490.013(2)(b) of the Criminal Code.",0.13953488372093023,"The accused were each found guilty, by jury, of breaking and entering the complainant's home and committing the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The accused were convicted as charged as principal and/or as a party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence. The jury found that the accused was not the perpetrator of the crime. The accused was sentenced to nine years incarceration because of parole violations. The court was also to be guided by the principles set out in s. 718.2 of the Code.  1) In a jury trial, the jury does not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction. The sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence in the case. 2) The accused has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. He has, by my count, 67 previous convictions. Most of his convictions relate to thefts and break and enters to commit theft. The offender was also found to be a principal or party in the aggravated assault on the complainant. The Court was to take into account the factors that the jury had identified as essential to convicting the accused. 3) The Court is to be bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury's verdict. The principles of parity in sentencing are set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC (CanLII), [2008] SCC 15, [2013] SKCA 27, 189 Sask. R. 190.",0.09359605911330049

After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review.

The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","HELD: The judgment was granted in the amount of the Admin Fee charged and paid by SGI to the individual claimants.

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.

It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","The plaintiff commenced a libel action against the defendants alleging that they, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in series of articles in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. (collectively the defendants). The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had published the words complained of in several articles and that the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The plaintiff sought an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control. The defendants opposed the request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which to conclude that no party would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the requested amendment. HELD: The plaintiff was found not negligent and exonerated. 1)The plaintiff was the successor to the plaintiff and was the owner of the StarPhoenix newspaper. 2)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, or any of them, were liable in defamation. 3)The defendants were aware of the existence of Dr. Graham's claim and were the current owners of the newspaper. 4)There were no errors in the statements of claim made by the plaintiff. The statement of claim was amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant. 5)The plaintiffs were not aware that the defendant was facing a defamation suit. 6)The court was not able to resolve the claim at mediation or pre-trial settlement conference and eventually the claim was set down for trial.","[46] I am satisfied that Postmedia Network Inc. was the successor to Canwest Publishing Inc. and at the time of trial, was the owner of the Star Phoenix newspaper. I am also satisfied that Postmedia Network Inc. was aware of the existence of Dr. Graham’s claim including knowledge of the matters in issue. [48] Here, there is nothing that leads me to believe that Postmedia Network Inc. would suffer prejudice or an injustice if they were added as a defendant at this time. For these reasons, Postmedia Network Inc. should be added as a defendant in this action. [50] I am not convinced that adding Postmedia Network Inc. as a defendant deprives them of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act. For both these reasons, the allegation that this November 24, 2007 article is defamatory is dismissed. The allegations that this January 3, 2008 article is defamatory are dismissed. [136] In this case, and in light of the aforementioned case law, I am satisfied that at the time of the publishing of the defamatory articles, Rod Nickel, being the city editor and Ms. Purdy’s immediate supervising editor, Cameron Hutchinson being the managing editor, Dale Brin being the publisher and general manager of the Star Phoenix and Steven Gibb being the editor-in-chief of the Star Phoenix are all joint tortfeasors of Ms. Purdy’s defamatory comments and as such, jointly and severally liable in defamation to Dr. Graham. [137] I am also satisfied that Canwest Publishing Inc. as the former owner of the Star Phoenix and its websites and Postmedia Network Inc. as the current owner of the Star Phoenix and its websites are also joint tortfeasors with Ms. Purdy and the other defendants noted and as such are jointly and severally liable in defamation to Dr. Graham. [209] Taking all these factors into account I conclude that an award of $50,000 for general damages would be appropriate. If aggravated damages are to be awarded in this instance, I must be satisfied that the defendants were motivated by actual or express malice. [220] However, I am additionally led to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Purdy did not believe that the jury had reached the proper verdict in the Baert case. I am satisfied that Ms. Purdy published the words complained of by Dr. Graham with reckless indifference as to their truth and as such, malice has been made out. [222] In my view, given these findings, an award of $50,000 for aggravated damages is appropriate. Dr. Graham is awarded general damages in the amount of $50,000 and aggravated damages in the amount of $50,000 together with pre-judgment interest pursuant to s. 5(1) of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, SS 1984-85-86, c P-22.2, and costs taxed in the appropriate column.",0.14854111405835546,"HELD: The action was allowed.

[48] Here, there is nothing that leads me to believe that Postmedia Network Inc. would suffer prejudice or an injustice if they were added as a defendant at this time. For these reasons, Postmedia Network Inc. should be added as a defendant in this action. [50] I am not convinced that adding Postmedia Network Inc. as a defendant deprives them of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act. For both these reasons, the allegation that this November 24, 2007 article is defamatory is dismissed. The allegations that this January 3, 2008 article is defamatory are dismissed. [136] In this case, and in light of the aforementioned case law, I am satisfied that at the time of the publishing of the defamatory articles, Rod Nickel, being the city editor and Ms. Purdy’s immediate supervising editor, Cameron Hutchinson being the managing editor, Dale Brin being the publisher and general manager of the Star Phoenix and Steven Gibb being the editor-in-chief of the Star Phoenix are all joint tortfeasors of Ms. Purdy’s defamatory comments and as such, jointly and severally liable in defamation to Dr. Graham. [137] I am also satisfied that Canwest Publishing Inc. as the former owner of the Star Phoenix and its websites and Postmedia Network Inc. as the current owner of the Star Phoenix and its websites are also joint tortfeasors with Ms. Purdy and the other defendants noted and as such are jointly and severally liable in defamation to Dr. Graham. [209] Taking all these factors into account I conclude that an award of $50,000 for general damages would be appropriate. If aggravated damages are to be awarded in this instance, I must be satisfied that the defendants were motivated by actual or express malice. [220] However, I am additionally led to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Purdy did not believe that the jury had reached the proper verdict in the Baert case. I am satisfied that Ms. Purdy published the words complained of by Dr. Graham with reckless indifference as to their truth and as such, malice has been made out. [222] In my view, given these findings, an award of $50,000 for aggravated damages is appropriate. Dr. Graham is awarded general damages in the amount of $50,000 and aggravated damages in the amount of $50,000 together with pre-judgment interest pursuant to s. 5(1) of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, SS 1984-85-86, c P-22.2, and costs taxed in the appropriate column.",0.027118644067796613,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The Court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in series of articles in the StarPhoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. The plaintiff suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The defendants did not publish any retraction or apology nor did they remove the alleged offensive articles. The court ordered the defendants to submit further written submissions on the plaintiff’s request for an injunction requiring them to remove certain articles from websites under their control if the plaintiff was found not negligent and finally exonerated.

The university's position was that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of the University of Saskatchewan Act and in particular Section 51. 2. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was correct. The standard of review applicable was correctness. The Faculty Association's position is that the president has the authority to overrule the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee in s.51 of Act, which states the Board may act only on the president's recommendation. 2)The interpretation of the s.50 interpretation of S.51 by the arbitrators was correctness or reasonableness. 3)The parties agreed to lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents. 4)The university's interpretation would be that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act and the collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. It is easy to see that, in their common usage, these terms can overlap. However, this is statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within University and these terms should be given meaning consistent with that context.",0.12138728323699421

The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents.

The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced.

There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act.

One cannot say the trial judge erred in his assessment of the evidence respecting the respondent's ability to pay.",0.21960784313725493,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. which reduced the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. 1) The Court was dealing with an application by the former wife to reinstitute maintenance payments which had terminated in accordance with the terms of the divorce agreement. 2) There was a radical change in the wife's circumstances which required a reduction in the amount of maintenance payable. 3) It was impossible to imagine under any circumstances that substantial variations in the income of the respondent could occur.

[40] In considering all of the factors surrounding Mr. Regnier’s financial circumstance and the potential cost of trial, I am of the view that Mr. Regnier has not demonstrated that he is indigent. [41] Accordingly, Mr. Regnier’s application for court appointed counsel is dismissed. I, therefore, direct that Mr. Regnier’s pre-trial in this matter is to be scheduled for Friday, July 25, 2014 at 10:00 a.m., and direct that Mr. Regnier is to be personally present on that occasion unless he has retained counsel to represent him, in which case counsel may appear on his behalf.",0.09703504043126686,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He had been committed to stand trial on the noted offence in Queen's Bench with Queen’s Bench justice sitting alone. At the preliminary inquiry, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined by the judge in her previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied for court appointed counsel in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as counsel for an accused. HELD: The application was dismissed. The accused was not persuaded that he had shown the requisite circumstance of being indigent. The court reviewed the financial situation of the accused and determined that he was probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The Court reviewed the factors that led to the conclusion that the accused was indigent and therefore not able to afford the costs of a court appointed lawyer.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The actual evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. HELD: The application proceeded by voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain Warrant to Search (ITO). The admissibility of this evidence was in issue. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s.8 Charter rights had been violated. The Court reviewed the sufficiency of warrant application and concluded that the Crown could adduce evidence to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time it was obtained and subject to the requirement that unconstitutionally obtained evidence cannot be considered. There was no dispute taken by the Crown to the procedure employed by the accused in this regard.,"[1] The accused has applied for relief pursuant to ss. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter] to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. He also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result of the search. BACKGROUND [5] The accused is charged in an Indictment as follows:
1. THAT HE, the said Dean Lommerse between the 2nd day of April, A.D. 2013 and the 30th day of May, A.D. 2013 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did commit a sexual assault on ----- --------, contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada.
2. THAT HE, the said Dean Lommerse between the 2nd day of April, A.D. 2013 and the 30th day of May, A.D. 2013 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did being in position of trust or authority toward ------ --------, a person aged sixteen years, for a sexual purpose, touch, directly or indirectly, with a part of the body, any part of the body of ------ --------, contrary to section 153(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
4. THAT HE, the said Dean Lommerse on or about the 25th day of October, A.D. 2013 at or near Regina, Saskatchewan, did have in his possession child pornography to wit: possessing digital files of a person who is or depicted as being under the age of eighteen years engaged in or depicted as being engaged in explicit sexual activity, or the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen, contrary to section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada. ISSUES [19] The following issues are raised for consideration on this voir dire:
1. What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant;
2. Is the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted;
3. Does the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought are evidence with respect to the commission of an offence;
4. Does the ITO use boiler plate clauses;
5. Does the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items are likely to be found in the place to be searched;
6. What is the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. 35 Challenges to the admissibility of real evidence seized during a search involve a two-step inquiry. It seeks to allege a whole new criminal offence and a whole new area of search on the accused’s computer devices. [34] As a result of this analysis, I am not prepared to admit the amplification evidence sought by the Crown. [43] I do not determine the ITO uses impermissible boiler plate clauses when it is read in its entirety. [51] In my view, it is a reasonable inference to draw that search history means the search history of the accused with respect to the websites identified in the ITO.

The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated. HELD: The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The determination of whether any evidence seized should be excluded was dependent on the decision on the above captioned issues. 1) There was no evidence at the amplification hearing to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time it was obtained and subject to the requirement that unconstitutionally obtained evidence cannot be considered.  2) The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone.  3) The application was to allow the Crown to supplement the record with testimony of that which was in the minds of the police and assist in proving the elements of the offence.,"[1] The accused has applied for relief pursuant to ss. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter] to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant.

The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.

The fact that the father had contact with her on this date did not alter that situation. 2) There was some debate as to the identity of the officer and the jurisdiction of the court. The Crown and the Ministry were in hot pursuit of an individual, and attempting to make the arrest. However, the fact that a worker had directed that the officer was not to have contact with the complainant does not alter the situation. 3) The court was also of the opinion that the parental service agreement gave the mother the right to enter her home and to search for the children, and that a warrant and judicial authorization to enter it would be required. 4) It was open to the Court to establish that the mother had a reasonable grounds to believe that the child was being harmful to the children and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of her having contact with them.","[1] The accused, Christine Jasmine Leigh Bigsky is charged that on March 23, 2015, she committed an assault on Jennifer Buchanan, contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code.

e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The Court found that the actions of the Defendant Renouf, who had cut down trees on the Claimants' property, were not criminal acts. The only issue was whether the Defendant Burrows became vicariously or jointly responsible when Mr. Renouf went on 'frolic of his own.' The Court allowed the costs as submitted on the basis that the case was a large one, and it had been met with a large Counterclaim which, though not seriously pursued, was nonetheless hanging over the heads of the claimants as they prepared for the trial. The Claimants were not content to limit their recovery to the Defendant. The claim against the Defendant was dismissed and the Court found the Defendant to be jointly liable.","[3] The issue in this unusual case concerns some trees that the Defendant Renouf cut down on the Claimants’ property, by mistake, while allegedly doing a favour for the Defendant Burrows. Issues [10] The issues as I see them are these: B. Was the Defendant Burrows jointly or vicariously responsible for the actions of Mr. Renouf, either because he was “hired” by Burrows or because the two were involved in a joint enterprise? iii. Is there a risk that removal of the trees will damage the Claimants’ septic field, and should the likely cost be added to the damages? [13] I have no doubt that this was an honest though careless mistake on the part of Mr. Renouf. Mr. Renouf is clearly liable for a trespass. Was the Defendant Burrows jointly or vicariously responsible for the actions of Mr. Renouf, either because he was “hired” by Burrows or because the two were involved in a joint enterprise? [20] I accept that there was no such relationship here. It was merely a case of one friend offering to perform a small gratuitous service, and expanding the scope of that service without the knowledge or assent of the other friend. There was no reasonable foreseeability that Mr. Renouf would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour’s property might be breached. In my view, the unifying principle in these cases is that there is a degree of blameworthiness which causes liability to attach. It can be because the enterprise was itself unlawful, or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties which created a foreseeable risk of harm. [27] I cannot find any element of blameworthiness here on the part of Mr. Burrows. In my view, the Claimants should receive $250.00 for each of the fifteen trees, for a total of $3,750.00. Is there a risk that removal of the trees will damage the Claimants' septic field, and should the likely cost be added to the damages? Furthermore, I regard the unwillingness of the Claimants to accept the assistance offered by Mr. Burrows to represent a failure to mitigate. [46] Given all of the factors at play, I allow the Claimants a further $2,000.00 for tree removal and all possible expenses associated with it.

b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","Appellant appeals decision of Smalls Claims Court. On May 18, 2010, the Adjudicator issued a decision against the Appellant in favour of the Respondent in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The Court found little merit to his argument that he knew nothing of the hearing date, the finding of fact that service had been effected does not result in a failure of natural justice as the court had the jurisdiction and authority to grant such an order. It therefore follows, that the court was entitled to issue a default judgment against him. The Appellants must accept the consequences of his decision to ignore the notice. HELD: 1) In considering a person's right to be heard, it does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. 2) In this case the Court adopts the reasoning of Justice Warner and in particular that the Court must also view the respondent's actions and the courts record of events in determining whether due process was followed and whether the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Court were adhered to. 3) In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the Small Claims Court as it is in the Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse.","On May 18th, 2010 ,the Adjudicator issued a decision against the Appellant, Jeffery Farrow in favour of the Respondent, Kelsey Butts in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35.

The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The accused had been in a common-law relationship with the complainant, with whom he lived for several years. The complainant alleged that the accused touched her in a sexual manner and that he had fondled her and touched her on the genitals. The Crown argued that the relationship between the complainant and the accused was similar to that of a person under the age of 16 years. HELD: The accused was found guilty of four counts. 1)The accused's credibility was mixture of reliability and reliability (are they now accurately recalling matters they had proper opportunity to observe and commit to memory in the past?) and honesty (the accused was disinterested in the outcome of the case and did not favour any party over another). 2)The essential elements of the offence were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v.

1. That he between the 16 day of October 1999 and the first day of April 2009 at or near Dartmouth... did unlawfully commit a sexual assault on SG contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code;

2. that he between 16 day of October 1999 and the first day of May 2008, did for a sexual purpose touch SG, a person under the age of 14 years, with a part of his body - the tongue and hands... contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code;

3. that he between 16 day of October 1999 and the first day of May 2008, did for a sexual purpose, invite SG, a person under the age of 14 years, to touch directly a part of his body - the penis of C. R. H., contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code;

4. that he between the first day of May 2008, and the first day of April 2009, did for a sexual purpose touch SG, a person under the age of 16 years with the part of his body - the hands... contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. 1.

iii) regarding Count #4, I find Mr. H. guilty under s. 151 of the most recent (“garbage bag”) incident which happened at * Crescent after May 1, 2008 and more specifically around early March 2009;

[15] The motion on behalf of the Attorney General to set a date for the extradition hearing is granted.",0.223463687150838,"The United States seeks to extradite the Jamaican national to face a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine. Griffiths was arrested in May 2003 and was granted bail pending his extradition hearing. Subsequently the Attorney General of Canada caused to be filed with the court written authority to proceed pursuant to s. 15 of the Extradition Act, 1999, c. 18. Section 24 of the Act obligates the court to proceed with an extradition hearing and the hearing must necessarily result in either committal under s. 29(1), which places the matter once again before the Attorney general, or discharge under ss. (3). HELD: The motion on behalf of the lawyer for the accused was dismissed. 1) It is alleged that the AG has not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control. Counsel for the AG however has undertaken that everything within the control of the AG General has been turned over to the solicitor for Griffiths except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2) There is no consideration given to parallel common law rights advanced by the AG vis-à-vis the denial of natural justice. It follows that the extent of Griffiths's right to disclosure of documents and information is limited to what is specified in the enabling statute. It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition proceeding. This would seem to be in breach of the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. 3) The application before the AG for a stay of proceedings on one or more of the following grounds is without merit and it is accordingly dismissed. The motion is to set a date for the extradition hearing to proceed. 4) The hearing judge's role is modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of a extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes prima facie case that the act alleged would constitute a crime in Canada. 5) The limited role of the hearing judge Charter jurisdiction is necessarily restricted to those issues specific to the functions of the extradition hearings. The Act does not confer an expanded Charter jurisdiction upon the AG.",0.1443298969072165

Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague.

Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question.

They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The questions were asked in relation to the cause and origin of the fire and whether certain documents referred to in the plaintiffs' statement as to documents and for which the plaintiffs claimed privilege were obtained from the City of Saskatoon. The plaintiffs were advised that the plaintiffs were not there when the fire first started. The court granted relief of such a general nature that the meaning of the order was uncertain. The defendants were not entitled to ask for expert opinion. Objection No. 7-P. 273, Line 2 to P. 461, Line 3: The plaintiffs' objection that the question was asking for the names of possible expert witnesses would seem to be borne out by the portion of the plaintiff's comments which were underlined. The plaintiff's objection was that the questions appeared to be asking for an expert opinion on a burn pattern. The question was too vague to answer. In an application of this nature proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given (Hill v. Board of Education). The defendants ought to ask specific questions, for example, whether the plaintiffs have any position that the detail outlined in that document is right, wrong or otherwise, and the plaintiffs are entitled to know what was in the wall where the Soprema was being applied not to an expert's interpretation of what was observable, such as what chemical change took place. In any event the defendants will have the opportunity to examine the city in the third party claim. 1) The court was asked what observations the question referred to. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to the question when reference is made to document. 2) The plaintiff cannot be said to be seeking facts when he asks for this information; he is seeking details of the appellant's investigation. That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect.

c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. HELD: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction.  1) The offender has serious health problems. As a result of a congenital heart disease, he required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had stroke. As consequence, he has left a left-side paresthesia and requires the use of a cane for stability and for walking lengthy distances. He appears to be at an age where his risk to reoffend can be expected to decline rapidly and that, therefore, his risk for re-offend violently will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his anger. 2) There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into s. 810 recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and attend drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He also had significant negative attitudes and on the basis of this factor, believed he was high risk to commit violent crimes in the future. He was also found to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and believed his potential for violent crimes was high. The Court was not at all sanguine regarding the offender's potential for success in such programming given his apparent denial of his culpability and lack of interest in most of the programming he had been ordered to attend.","[1] Albert Trevor Peters (the “offender”) pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common‑law partner contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. However, it seems to me that he should be given the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning via such programming. In my opinion, Mr. Peters is a high risk to re‑offend violently and sexually violently [sic] in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. Therefore, it is, in my opinion, an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? Analysis A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? The offence of aggravated assault is clearly a “serious personal injury offence” in that it is an indictable offence and involves the use of violence against another person in which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years. [40] The Crown has proven that the offender committed “serious personal injury offence” on November 4, 2006, within the meaning of s. 752(a) and, accordingly, this threshold requirement has been met. B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? [46] Nonetheless, I find that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). The offender has demonstrated a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour culminating in serious assaults on women. C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? [50] Accordingly, having found the offender to have met the dangerous offender criteria, I must, nonetheless, consider the application of the long‑term offender provisions and utilize that option if the offender meets the long‑term offender criteria and there is a reasonable possibility that the offender’s risk to reoffend could be acceptably managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). [57] The offender has never been sentenced to periods of incarceration which resulted in him being placed in a federal penitentiary and thus, has not been offered the kind of programming available via the federal penitentiary system. D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? [68] Given all of the circumstances and all of the principles of sentencing that I must apply, I conclude that a seven‑year sentence is a fit and proper sentence for the determinate portion of the sentence. I am prepared to go along with the submission of counsel and provide a one‑for‑one credit for the time that the offender has spent in pre‑sentence custody. Giving the offender three years eight months credit towards his seven‑year sentence results in a further period of incarceration of three years four months. Conclusion [82] I find the offender Albert Trevor Peters to be a long­‑term offender. The appropriate determinate sentence for the charge of aggravated assault in these circumstances is seven years in prison. He ought to get credit for time spent on remand of three years eight months, which results in a sentence of three years four months in prison.",0.1572387344199425,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.

The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he had accumulated several violence related convictions and concluded that his risk to re-offend violently in the future was mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. HELD: The offender was granted the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning via such programming. 1) It is an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. If he refuses to do so, his risk for committing acts of future violence is high. He appears to predate upon intimate partners for reasons which are not clear to me. However, there seems to be a pattern of offending in this way which will mitigate the risk of him returning violently and sexually violently to his current residence. 2) The Court reviewed the circumstances of the offences and found that the offender was a high risk to return violently and violently violently to the current residence and that he was in the early stages of his violent offending behaviour. He appeared to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and did not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life and in his potential for violent crimes. 3) The court reviewed the factors that might exacerbate the individual's risk for violence. It is not possible to conclude that the risk is high because the offender is only convicted of one previous sexual offence and that was over a decade ago in 2002. In light of the single, dated conviction, the medical problems that cause degree of infirmity and that his now in his fifties, the risk will continue to be high. If the offender continues to deny his culpability and sabotage his attendance in programming, the Court will conclude that he is a high-risk, high need offender on most scales used for this purpose. 4) There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history.

Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? Analysis A. Is the predicate offence (the triggering offence) a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Criminal Code? The offence of aggravated assault is clearly a “serious personal injury offence” in that it is an indictable offence and involves the use of violence against another person in which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years. [40] The Crown has proven that the offender committed “serious personal injury offence” on November 4, 2006, within the meaning of s. 752(a) and, accordingly, this threshold requirement has been met. B. Is the offender a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Criminal Code and, thus, a danger to society? [46] Nonetheless, I find that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). The offender has demonstrated a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour culminating in serious assaults on women. C. If so, should the Court exercise its residual discretion and impose a fixed‑term sentence or resort to the long‑term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring Mr. Peters a dangerous offender have been met? [50] Accordingly, having found the offender to have met the dangerous offender criteria, I must, nonetheless, consider the application of the long‑term offender provisions and utilize that option if the offender meets the long‑term offender criteria and there is a reasonable possibility that the offender’s risk to reoffend could be acceptably managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). [57] The offender has never been sentenced to periods of incarceration which resulted in him being placed in a federal penitentiary and thus, has not been offered the kind of programming available via the federal penitentiary system. D. If a long‑term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long‑term supervision order should be imposed? [68] Given all of the circumstances and all of the principles of sentencing that I must apply, I conclude that a seven‑year sentence is a fit and proper sentence for the determinate portion of the sentence. I am prepared to go along with the submission of counsel and provide a one‑for‑one credit for the time that the offender has spent in pre‑sentence custody. Giving the offender three years eight months credit towards his seven‑year sentence results in a further period of incarceration of three years four months. Conclusion [82] I find the offender Albert Trevor Peters to be a long­‑term offender. The appropriate determinate sentence for the charge of aggravated assault in these circumstances is seven years in prison.

b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision.

Section 2(1)(f) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act provides for protection to farmers against loss of their farm land. Section 4 of the Act clearly states that a person can make an application with respect to a mortgage on farm land, but does not include: minerals contained in, on or under that land; land used primarily for the purpose of extracting, processing, storing or transporting minerals; and 'farming' includes livestock raising, poultry raising, dairying, tillage of the soil, bee-keeping, fur farming or any other activity undertaken to produce primary agricultural produce and animals. The plaintiff was not a farmer but rather was a developer and the Land was not farm land but rather a development site. HELD: 1) The Christie decision was dismissed. 2) The court found that the Christie case had no application here as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, now repealed. The SFSA circa 1988-89 is said by them to have replaced, modified or reversed the legislative intention of providing farm land protection. 3) The proposed use of the land was recited in opposition to the application by the plaintiff for an order nisi for judicial sale and for declaration that the proceedings commenced are nullity pursuant to s. 11 of The Farm Land Security Act. 4) There was no evidence that the defendants had any interest in the land at the time the Christie action was brought. 5) The plaintiff had no obligation to pay into court any additional amount needed to attain a bid over the Land value. 6) The defendant was not the person mortgaging the land.","[2] FMI issued a statement of claim in October 2009 seeking foreclosure on the Land. and

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody.

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The parties agreed that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of support for the children within the meaning of the Divorce Act, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. 2)The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable directly to the petitioner for the purposes of the application. The court found that the amount payable by the respondent was $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses. Based upon the respondent's 2007 income of $44,781 and Ms. Strueby's 2006 income $90,628, the Guideline amount for the support of Keegan and Luke is $380 for the period of March 2003 to September 2007. 3)The child support arrears owing under the judgment of Justice Dielschneider dated February 28, 2000 were $10,587. It was well-settled that full time attendance in post-secondary education may result in a child over the age a majority qualifying as 'child' within the Meaning of the Act. However, the parties were at odds concerning all three children. The parties were in agreement that Jill, now 26 years of age and on her own, was no longer a child of the marriage. The father sought an order for an orderly payment of the child support orders.  4)The application was adjourned until November 1, 2008 at which time the respondent will be ordered to pay $500 per month for child support as well as an additional sum of $100 for child care expenses and extracurricular activities until such time as the child is no longer eligible to pay child support in an appropriate fashion.  5)The father was to have paid $1,147 per month in child support since August 20, 2007 in respect to the maintenance order of February 28 2000.  6)The mother sought to have her child support ordered in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The order was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Zaba, which set out a number of factors court should consider in determining whether a child attending a post-primary education remains a child within the definition of the Dorce Act.","(c) An Order eliminating the Applicant’s child support arrears as at the time of the application in the amount of $17,400.00, for the period of March 2003 to September 2007; [6] In this case, the parties agree that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of Mr. Strueby’s income, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order.

The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1.

The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, six months community supervision, one year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal. [2] It is the view of this Court that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was demonstrably unfit, failing to taking into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the respondent, and the principles of sentencing set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The gist of that decision is that under the Act, the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. It is our view that these principles dictated a long term custodial sentence in this case, to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent’s attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent’s likelihood of rehabilitation. [17] The Crown’s application for leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent is granted and the appeal is allowed. That sentence is to be set aside. In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by a period of community supervision of six months and a period of probation of one year. He will also be subject to a 10 year firearms prohibition as in the original sentence.",0.6119162640901772,"This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff had been constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff $19,200.00. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his termination. HELD: The plaintiff can rely on s. 33 of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off. The defendant then bears the onus of rebutting the presumption of entitlement in accordance with some exception set out in LSA. The next preliminary issue to be determined is the period for which the plaintiff may make such a claim for holiday pay. The court should not appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance, as the plaintiff was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage.","[2] The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. Further it asserts that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay, as the plaintiff was a “manager” within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. [24] Further, the defendant claims that if the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c.

At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective.

Finding: I find the defendant was negligent in the implementation of its system of inspection of trees which posed a hazard to users of the highway.

I dismiss the third party claim of the defendant against the third parties.",0.14189189189189189,"The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on his truck, crushing him inside the cab. He was now a paraplegic. The plaintiff's action against the defendants Redden and Lockhart was discontinued. This defendant had joined a third party as a Third Party seeking contribution and/or indemnity from them. HELD: The Court found that in order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty has been held to exist. The Court also found that it was necessary to articulate a policy of preventing tort actions from becoming vehicle for judicial interference with decisionmaking that is properly exercised by other branches of the government and protecting the Government from liability that would seriously handicap efficient government operations.",0.088135593220339
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The hearing judge found that the income replacement benefit (IRB) for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. HELD: The respondent was not entitled to any more costs from SGI. 1)The hearing judge erred in holding that the respondent's IRB for the 180 day period was not to be less or greater than the amount paid by the respondent. The IRB calculation was based on the court's finding of facts and the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits Montgrand was receiving.  2)SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the legislation [ss.117(4)]. It strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average' approach used by SGI, but that is too restrictive a definition of the phrase. Section 134 of the act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal.","It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner’s IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners.

The contempt proceedings instituted last spring are still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to file statements of defence. The defendants have abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside the judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. It is clear from the terms of the order that the defendants and their solicitor, in accordance with their duty to their clients and to proceed with reasonable dispatch through the various stages of the lawsuit until it is eventually determined, do not have the level of courtesy and professionalism that is expected of a member of the legal profession. 2)The defendants have consistently attempted to improperly thwart at every turn the efforts of the plaintiff to determine the matters raised in these lawsuits. They have consistently failed to lead the court to believe that their conduct is in excess of that of a proper officer or director. 3)Failing agreement between the solicitors for the parties as to acceptable dates and to what extent they were entitled to unilaterally set the dates.  4)The defendant corporation is not liable to pay any conduct money for the initial attendances and for any subsequent attendances.","The plaintiff applies to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp.

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp., on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year.

In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze.
