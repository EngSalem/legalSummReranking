"At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent has had access. At issue is the status quo for the child. The petitioner is paying interim child support of $193 per month and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and reasonable telephone access. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support the conclusion that both parties are loving parents to their child and that the mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable.","At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month.

The application consumed 1 full day, and the morning of October 20, 2011 by ending at 10:45 a.m. The court calculated that the matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required a significant amount of effort to prepare for, conduct the hearing and to review the evidence to be able to provide briefs to the court post hearing.","Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing.

"The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's right hand as he walked down the driveway towards the property. The defendant had a shovel in his hand and the accused had a knife. The knife was not in the accused's hand as the defendant had pulled it out of his pants. The altercation continued and the defendant suffered fractures to his elbow and rib cage as result of the assault. The accused and the victim both suffered from fractures to their upper arm. The defence evidence established a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the defendant intentionally struck the victim and thereby granted him his right to enter a premises for the purpose of preventing a trespass. The Court found that the accused, by driving in anger to the property and entering thereon despite being told not to enter upon the property, placed himself in the role of an aggressor. It would have been reasonable for the accused to have believed the defendant to be a trespasser and thereby justified in using no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass.","Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.",2007nspc30.txt,"The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence.

"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed damages for the loss of its engine and claimed depreciation or betterment. The defendant refused to pay the $503.73 deducted for depreciation and returned the vehicle to its owner. The owner claimed for the entire repair and loss of his vehicle. The claim was abandoned and the plaintiff brought an action against the insurer, Saskatchewan Government Insurance. HELD: The claim for reimbursement was dismissed. 1)Section 8(4) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act states that an election is an election held within the meaning of the Act. In this case, the insurer was not entitled to any deduction for depreciation. 2)An express election is not necessary. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to have made an election to reinstate. However, two qualifications are placed on when an insurer's conduct will constitute an election: an election pursuant to s. 39 of The Act and an election by conduct. The first being that an insurer elects to repair or replace a vehicle pursuant to statutory condition 8(3) of s.39. In the circumstances, this was an election. 3)The claim for depreciation is dismissed. 4)The insurer has neither expressly elected to reinstatement nor elected to do so. The statutory scheme is quite clear. The fact that SGI elected to repair the vehicle does not constitute a election. The actuarial report prepared by the insurer and the repair shop did not inform the plaintiff as to the damage to the vehicle. 5)The roving appraiser appraised the damage, provided an appraisal and advised the plaintiff. Thereafter, Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff about the damage. 6)The Court held that an express election does not exist. The insurer may make an election of sorts.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.",b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident.

"The father petitions for sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. Since the commencement of these proceedings, each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is clear that this child is slower, but the same cannot be said about the opportunity to earn a living in Moose Jaw other than the fact that she is the eldest of the five children at the time of this child's birth. This child is the product of tumultuous relationships between father and daughter. The mother's relationship with her daughter has not been fostered in a meaningful way. The father has had no effective communications with either of the respondents, J. O. or C. H., and information is generally passed through his wife or through his own mother and on to himself. 3) There is no evidence as to how the mother would parent the child should be placed in the custody of the child. It would be unfair and unjust to place the child in the hands of her biological father and require him to assume a more traditional and secondary role in the child's life.","Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to.

"FIAT The petitioner father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. She sought to restrict access to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay costs of the application fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the mother has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the limited access offered by the respondent realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. She continued to be held in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The respondent did NOT abduct the child. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with the termsof the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The court awarded solicitor and client costs of $60 per month.","FIAT.

"The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner counter-petitioned in 1992 for division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay the petitioner $400 per month and the sum of $800 and $400 for the maintenance of the two children.  2)The petitioner had a beneficial interest created by the order of the court sufficient to support registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $50,711.66. 3)The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission was to transfer the sum to an RRSP as may be prescribed by the petitioner. 4)The mother was to apply to the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment of the amount then outstanding. 5)The father was not seeking custody of the children.

"The plaintiff certified organic farmer sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant and that the quality requirements of the contract had been met. There was nothing in the contract with Wlaswich that allowed the plaintiff to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party.  2) The documents submitted by the defendant purportedly copies of the German documentation were not admitted into evidence.  3) The issue is of little relevance in coming to the final conclusion. 4) The plaintiff has satisfied his contractual obligations and is entitled to pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51,608 from the 26th day of September 2006 until the date of judgment.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats.

She had called the accused late in the night prior to the offence and said that she did not care if she went to jail for this.

"The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the CAP and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions for directions. The appellant argues the CAP was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the applicant to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by the appellant are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal will look at the reasons for the impugned order. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a determination of the CAP process procedural in nature and each of the grounds of MLG is bound to fail. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. MLG has failed to establish that there is a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, to the field of practice or the state of law, or to the administration of justice generally to warrant a determination by the Court. MLG's appeal will be allowed in its usual fashion and the leave application will have its costs in the usual manner.","The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them.

"The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month.

"The appellant applied a wrong principle of law in refusing to strike out the respondent's statement of claim pursuant to a motion brought under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25. The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appellant states that the actions of the Board and of the personal defendants who participated in the decisions leading to these actions were an attempt to stonewall the plaintiff from uncovering and making public that the principal of the plaintiff and that he was alleged to have an anti-union attitude. The appellants subsequently brought an application for certiorari to the Court of Appeal to quash the Board's orders and its decision to refuse leave to apply for reconsideration. The Chambers judge dismissed the application for leave to appeal. The appeal was allowed in part on the grounds that the Chambers judge erred in law in not striking out the claim. The issue of Crown immunity in this case was not plain and obvious. It was more akin to statutory defence to an action.","The appellants motion to strike the respondent's statement of claim was dismissed on the ground that questions of law are not matters to be brought before the court on an application to strike.

"The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children, who had recently passed away, alleged that the accused had given him money to sell cattle and that he was going to blow them up in plastic bags. Accused's lawyer objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The accused was convicted of uttering the threat. The Court held that since the accused was a professional criminal and would not wish to be prejudiced by the law, his prior convictions should not be disregarded. There was no evidence presented as to whether the accused took the words seriously or if there was a reasonable inference that they were intended to. The evidence was conclusive that the statements were made to the court by the accused and were not intended to be given to the jury. Therefore, the Court allowed the application based on s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act.","The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code.

His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility.

"The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were found not guilty of all charges.  2) There was no evidence that the defendants, or anyone they may have related to, had consented to the construction of the boathouse on public reserves. 3) The evidence did not suggest they intended to offend anyone. The defendants had clearly intended to use the land as a playground and not as a public reserve. The fact that the bylaw prohibiting the use of any kind of recreational activity on a public park or reserve was not an appropriate ground of jurisdiction for their charge. Further, the defendants had no standing to sue anyone for trespassing. The bylaw respecting the construction did not apply to their claim to the park or any other protected land. 4) The plaintiff was found guilty of trespass to the public reserve on the ground that the building was constructed on a piece of land which was not protected by the existing park or other protected lands. The plaintiff had standing to challenge the zoning bylaws on his land as they were not validly binding under the existing provincial legislation. 5) The defendant was found to have violated the plaintiff's right to be entitled to a fair trial on any and all matters of this nature. The court found that the defendant had not attempted to circumvent the by-laws respecting the creation of the reserve by virtue of the fact that it was on a protected land and not a reserve. Therefore, the court stayed the charge against him. 6) The court considered that the plaintiff had not tried to override the provisions in the provincial bylaw which prevented the creation or use of a recreational or swimming area on a designated public reserve, and thus had no grounds to prosecute him for trespass. The defendant should have been given the opportunity to reconsider his approach to the matter.","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.",9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.

The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court held that it did not accept the expert's opinion as to causation of the damage. The court found that the injuries were pre-existing and did not contribute to any of the plaintiffs injuries. The expert was not qualified to give an opinion on causation of injury in the lower back as he had not reviewed the collision in detail nor had he read or studied in the area of the causation of injuries in low velocity rear-end collisions.,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.",b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries.

"The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the Information To Obtain Search (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence, or creation of child pornography, but only of invitation to sex. The same issue was raised in R. v. Vu, which dealt with the issue of whether a justice acting judicially could have facilitated the issuance of a search warrant. In this case, the accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude, while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. The search of the computer was conducted immediately and before returning any of the items to the justice, and without further authorization as is now required. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief as it did not refer to the child who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The cumulative effect of these errors was a conclusion that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue in the court's opinion. The above conclusion therefore renders the warrant to Search a nullity, and the search unlawful.","Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.",5_2014skpc78.txt,"The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v.

The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case."
"The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants’ case is submitted through the affidavit of Nordstrom. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was awarded judgment for 50 percent of the value of the investment at maturity, $34,250.55. The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of the deceased to the date that judgment and his costs to be taxed are dismissed. 2) The defendant was named as defendant and no evidence was led against it and the claim against it was dismissed.  3) The disappointed beneficiary principle has usually arisen and may well usually arise in the context of solicitors and will preparation, but this “disappointed beneficiary” principle is not function merely of the defendant”s occupation. The court found that in the circumstances, the defendant had no application in that court as it was represented concurrently with Nordstrom, there was no order as to costs for or against it.","The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss.

"The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is working part-time and living at home with the children. Luke is 18 and attending university. He decided not to go to university that fall. He commenced full-time studies at the University of Regina in September. He continues to work part time. HELD: 1)The Table amount of support for children based upon the respondent's income would be $1,153 per month. It would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for support of Luke during the months of September to December. 2)The children were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. The Court of Appeal in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 89 (C.A.). 3)Both Luke and Amanda are children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They are involved in their reasonable pursuing of post -secondary education. 4)The Court found that the respondent misapplied s.3(2)(a) of the Guidelines by failing to resort to the provisions of s. 3(2(b). 5)The petitioner's income was $3,330 in 1999, $4,050 in 2000 and $18,000 in 2001. He received $5,000 per annum in student loans. He is able to cover most of their direct education expense through student loans and earns approximately $475 per month from his part time employment. He also has a line of credit which he can draw upon. In the circumstances at hand, it is appropriate to have the respondent pay the Table amount for both children and his proportionate share of post-'secondary expenses not covered by student loans.' 6)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it was not so clear how this is to be applied in an individual circumstance. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and the legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency and to ensure consistent treatment of spouses and children who are in similar circumstances. It is the Court's position that the cost of maintaining the home for the children (and the petitioner's children) must exceed the generous ambit of support","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.",b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278.

"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs and the defendant objected. The defendant argued that the affidavITS were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that public disclosure of the allegations made by the defendants would exacerbate the harm which had been done to them. The defendants argued that, given the high school grapevine in this electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits would not cause further harm to them in view of the efficacy of the high-school grapevine. The public, including fellow students of the youth, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the two young people and ramifications to others. HELD: The order was granted. The sealing order was at the top of the range of protections the court may afford to individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits that speak to their effects of their assault on and ramifications for others should be sealed since there is a real and serious risk of further harm. The evidence of the assaults and related proceedings had already generated strong emotions on all sides. The assaults and the related proceedings have already generated negative comments on social media. The administration of justice was concerned that such disclosure would put both the physical and psychological well-being of the students and their families at further risk. The protection of the public, especially fellow students, has already been breached.

"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque, where payment does not satisfy just debt. The defendant had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The certified cheq did not satisfy a just debt as the defendants had already received payment for their services. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants motion must be dismissed as the plaintiff’s statement of claim adequately discloses a cause for action in mistake of facts/un just enrichment. The Court must assume that all the allegations in this case possess sufficient evidence to support the claim. The facts in this instance suggest that the bank had an action for restitution against both the plaintiff and the holder certified checeque as payment did not satisfied just debt and the defendants were already receiving payment for the services. As the plaintiff had already deposited the replacement, and the certified cheques did not constitute a just Debt, the claim cannot be defeated on that ground.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a).

"An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of the Investment Dealers Association following findings by a disciplinary panel that the appellant had broken rules by which the investment dealers' profession regulates itself. The appellant alleged that the panel acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging Ripley with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were clearly not his responsibility. The charges involved disclosure of information about federal cabinet minister; permitting employees to take part in'side deals' (trades in securities not approved by his head office); failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals; failing to supervise an employee who was involved in side deals. Ripley was found guilty of three breaches of a by-law which established a disciplinary jurisdiction for engaging in any business conduct which is unbecoming of a professional.

"The plaintiffs apply pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules (QBR) for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the defendant on issues arising from his responses to the written questions; and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs. The issue is whether the plaintiffs have a cause of action for aggravated and punitive damages. HELD: The application is adjourned sine die. A number of applications have been brought in relation to the plaintiff and her children. In addition to pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, each plaintiff claims aggravated damages and punitive or exemplary damages. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The court will determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation the plaintiff's skills, technique, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to reply to undertakings made by the defendant regarding their care and treatment of the plaintiff. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. The jurisprudence in medical malpractice cases does not favour granting aggravated and negative damages. However, special circumstances exist permitting further examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.",d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery.

"FIAT: The first access issue was for the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The second was for child support purposes. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The schedule as detailed by Ryan-Froslie J. was not an extrapolation of the previous access order. The court applied for a variation of the January 2007 access order which specified access for two weeks followed by one week off.

"FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application to strike the claim against SMI is based on the fact that the plaintiffs policy holders are third parties to SMI. The issue is whether SMI was in an exclusive relationship of insurance between the plaintiff and the defendants and is entitled to attempt to limit the liability of the first defendants. 2) In every insurance contract an insurer has an implied obligation to deal with the claims of its insureds and to provide a fair and equitable settlement. This obligation arises naturally from the plaintiffs' relationship with SMI and their insurer. 3) In this case SMI brought an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) to have the claim struck in its entirety. The plaintiff is the policy holder of the defendant SMI policy. The Court referred to numerous decisions where no duty to third party by an insurance company was found to exist. 4) The Court found that a breach of a contract does not give rise to a separate cause of action. Rather, it is an avenue for the development of duty in tort if Vorvis makes necessary. 5) In the alternative, the Court could order a judgment or order for punitive damages.","Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured.

Nine defendants brought separate motions pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against them or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs’ claims against the Walbaum Group had been decided. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies (All-Rite Plumbing, and Tamwal Investments) and his wife, Tammy Walbaum. The defendants’ evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced in no more than two and one-half days, given the number and complexity of their claims. Specific days to be designated by counsel for the plaintiffs may pertain to the evidence to be called against one, two or all three of the applicants. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs were not precluded from adducing evidence related to the Walbarge Group”s dealings with each other or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walba Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense. 2) The plaintiff was awarded general and special damages for pecuniary losses of approximately $20,000. 3) The defendants were relieved from attending the trial on any date not designated by them or designated by the trial judge for preparing a defence or presenting argument. 4) Costs were in the cause.","FIAT: The defendants, Sims, Garbriel and Dumurs, bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a), for severance of the claims against them or for an order staying the claims against them until the plaintiffs' claim against the primary defendant, Walbaum have been heard and decided. HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

"FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee. The panel found that based on the respondent's agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The respondent took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and conclude that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment record, the final incident justified termination of his employment. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The standard of judicial review applicable to disputes arising under a mutual agreement is the patently unreasonable test, absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. The parole evidence rule precludes the receipt of verbal evidence offered for the purpose of adding to, varying or qualifying in any manner the terms of the written document. 2)The wording of clause 10 of the mutual agreement does not admit of such an argument. 3)There is no basis for the admissibility of an oral statement of intention on this account. 4)The application was allowed in part on the ground that the Board was not prepared to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident. The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months.","FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.",b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee.

"FIAT: The applicant/petitioner applies for a variation of an interim order issued by the Court in August 2007. The order was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The parties agree that these are reasonable arrangements for the support of the child pursuant to s. 15.1(8) of the Divorce Act. The applicant also bases his position on the fact that the marriage was an 11 year marriage and that he was, when the order was made and continues to be, a member of the Canadian Armed Forces.HELD: The application is dismissed. In the interests of avoiding multiple court proceedings in the future, the applicant has agreed to proceed to complete an application to split the CPP credits to the account of the petitioner equally, the same to be supported by the respondent once her first degree is ruled upon. The respondent recommenced his military career in early 2000 and served in the military at the time he authorized the Order he now seeks to vary. This is based upon Ms. Ellis-Reid's failure to obtain employment of any significance since the Order and her failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the parties and found that voluntary early retirement or the choice of a payor to either leave the work force, stop working, go back to school or change jobs all by choice as opposed to necessity, do not constitute a material change of circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce the payor's obligation to pay child or spousal support.",HELD: The application was dismissed.

"A review of the issues of parenting and support as directed by the interim order of August 18, 2010. HELD: 1) The court was not persuaded that it was in the children's best interests to change the interim access order made in August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it. Those questions were best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility could be considered and adjudicated. 2) The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were adjourned for review by the pre-trial conference. The court found that considering the existing means and needs of the parties, the respondent was not the best interests of the children to order interim child support since it was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 3) The respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential.","The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support.

"The vendors and their predecessors in title had established a good and marketable possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property. The plaintiffs brought an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants was without merit. Application granted; although the time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of such possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act, the court found that it did not have that long a history as there had been open, notorious and continuous possession by the vendors and purchasers since before the time of the present possessory ownership.","This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit. For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years.

"The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied for a remand for assessment pursuant to section 752.1 of the Code, as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the evidence concerning attempts made to control the offender’s behaviour in the community and the expert who testified at the trial who had been qualified to provide the necessary assessment. The matter was adjourned to permit the expert to complete his assessment. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that on an application to have an offender declared dangerous offender, the Court must first consider whether the subject of the application might be a long-term offender, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in s.753 have been met. The Court proposed to review the applicable law at the outset, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV of the code in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Courtof Appeal, and given the unusual nature of this sentencing procedure. The statutory requirements for finding that an offender is a dangerous person are set out in s753.1(c). There must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated. This is especially true in borderline cases, where the offender does not suffer from an inherent defect of character or reason and seems to have been living an appropriate life. The standard is not whether cure is guaranteed but whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control in society.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.",d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.

"The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of the Agricultural Implements Regulations. While direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in the auction documents. HELD: 1) The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH Corp. and to the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse to restock direct ship inventory. 2) There is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique. Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. 3) Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary contractual provision, the agreement was not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. There was nothing special about the product, about the dealer's use of it, or about the ability of Wheatland or any other dealer to sell the product to retail customers in the normal course of business. The only link between Wheatland and the third party supplier was that the supplier would deliver the product directly to the respondent rather than first delivering it to Case or New Holland for shipment to Wheatland.  4) The contractual provisions clearly entitle CNH to refuse the restocking of direct ship components. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by the respondent and inventory/credit financed by the NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for. In the context in which the issue has arisen, this is a collateral matter which has no impact on the outcome except as to costs.  5) The parties have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The issue does not end there. The contractual right of the respondents (the Bank of Canada and CNH Capital) is the cornerstone of the priority agreement.  6) TD applied to terminate the appointment of PwC pursuant to the February 2007 order and to appoint it as receiver and manager in respect of all of the Wheatland assets, undertakings and properties pursuant to ss. 65(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, S. 6.2 and s. 7 of the Personal Property Security Act. 7) The respondent companies objected to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. 8) The respondents claimed they were entitled to set off credits against debits in other Wheatland accounts relating to","In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.",2_2009skqb516.txt,"The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts.

The father had been employed for 5 years as a computer consulting firm and had recently acquired equipment and claimed capital cost allowance in lieu of renting equipment. HELD: The application was refused with leave to return the issue to Court with appropriate supporting materials. 1)The most reliable indicator of true income is the 1998 year because of the significantly higher amount he earned at the mine. She argued that income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. The farm income will be adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowances for this year. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school there, why the expense isnecessary in relation to the child's best interests or whether the child has any means to contribute to the expense. The mother had set out a reasonable basis for disallowing certain expenses. The claims for gas and repairs are significantly higher than in previous years and no explanation is offered. The capitalpayments for land and machinery, and the costs of the step-child's pet should properly be excluded. 3)Costs of the two children's s.19(1)(g) income were refused as the respondent's income was $347 per child.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute.

"The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s.23 of the Act and s.35(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. The children are identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: 1)Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b). As the first option set out in s. 37, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is appropriate in these circumstances. 2)The Agency has chosen to designate each child as a person of sufficient Interest. The Agency will provide personal service to each child within 15 days of receipt of the order. 3)It is important that the children continue to have sense of security in their placement and continuity in their lives, both of which they will have if they remain in their current placement. Each child would be in all likelihood remain where they were on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the 2012 order being sought than a lesser order.","A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.",c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).

The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister."
"FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. This Court made an order fixing the parties' incomes and providing for ongoing support of $129 per month. It also terminated the respondent's payments for Brett. HELD: 1) The Court must do so keeping in mind the objectives set out in the Guidelines. Whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. 2) There is no presumption in favour of retroactive support. Parliament has left this for judicial determination. 3) This Court prefers the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which took the position that if Parliament could have made a policy choice, it would not have done so. Retroactive support orders often create debt that may affect the payor's ability to meet his ongoing obligations to the children covered by the order but may also adversely affect their ability to provide for other children in their care.","The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.",4_2005skqb265.txt,"In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month.

"The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that his hand was trembling as he handed over his documents, that his face was trembling, his eyes were puffy and he did not display any emotion of the sort that would normally attract a police dog. 2) The evidence was excluded from the search of the motor home as a result of his rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. of the charter. The accused did not raise any concerns with respect to his rights as a person of the legal age. 3) The motor home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments were created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The smell of marijuana and black plastic bags containing bricks of cocaine were found in the interior of the vehicle. The motorhome was extensively altered to facilitate transportation of drugs. During the search, the police officers observed vehicles weaving from one end of the road to the other and noticed that there were two large piles of plastic bags in the middle of the roadway. The plastic bags were found under the seat where the duffle bag had been placed. The police officers used a mobile work station to locate the vehicle and made name inquiries on police databases. The vehicle was parked on the shoulder of the highway near where the search was conducted. The vehicles were equipped with windshield view video cameras and audio recording devices. The evidence of the accused's right to counsel and his right to remain silent were not excluded under ss.(8, 9, 10 and 10) of The Charter. The Court found that the accused had not raised any concerns about his rights with respect thereto. The issue is whether the evidence be excluded under s.(24) of s.8, s.9 and s.10 of the Code. 3)'s (red, black and blue) covers were found where the plastic bags had been removed and replaced with wood screws. The presence of a 'breath' in the","The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence.

If, as Hurd now alleges, he was excluded from coverage because of the August experience, attach no significance to what he now says. 3)The fact that Hurd required medical attention and surgery in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel was not a sufficient condition to bring the plaintiff within the operation of the exclusionary clause.

"The appellants appealed a Summary Conviction Appeal Court decision ordering a new trial on seven counts against them under s. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act. The charges against both accused relate to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. The appeal judge was not prepared to make such a finding. The retrun of the tax returns was both false and the records and record keeping were part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes. 2) There is some question as to whether either accused wilfully evaded the payments of taxes, or whether there was any intent to make a statement knowing it to be false and deceptive. The bookkeeping was haphazard and sloppy. The Court ordered the trial judge to be completely honest. 3) The Crown argued the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false thus obviating the liability for tax.

SUST will not exercise his or her discretionary authority to provide","The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case.

"The defendant, who was the step-father of the plaintiff, commenced an action against the plaintiff claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. A. did not defend the action. The plaintiff alleged that A. had sexually assaulted her and her brother and had forced her to perform oral sex on him. The assaults continued for approximately eleven years. The mother, aware of the child's sexual abuse, had been forced to take medication for depression and became suicidal. The father's subsequent sentencing to 1 year in prison resulted in a 1 year term of imprisonment. Damages were assessed in the amount of $25,000. The Court reduced the award to $2500. The aggravated damage award was reduced to $40,000 and was not subject to any reduction. The wife was awarded judgment against A. in the sum of $65,000 togetherwith her taxable costs.","The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault.

"The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: 1) It is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver’s license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. 2) The evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty. 3) The determination of credibility does not involve the court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the court must prove that its evidence is credible, and there is no onus on the accused to establish a strict liability offence. The accused was acquitted of all charges.","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope.

"The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by a vehicle driven by the insured. The insurance company, Guardian, brought an action against the plaintiff pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy. The plaintiff's claim against the insurer was brought on the basis of her failure to indicate any interest in claiming repayment of the monies paid under the policy that had been paid to the insured prior to the accident. The defendant argued that, since the insurance company had refused to accept the plaintiff's evidence as to employment at the time of the accident, it was not open to the plaintiff to accept its money. Awarding the plaintiff $140 for loss of income for 129 weeks, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation and to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the plaintiff from getting its money back.

"The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, is a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of a conviction for child abuse. Although the mother is more connected to the child and has taken more interest in the long term care, she is more financially stable. Both parties were very uncooperative with the agency and it was clear neither was willing to work with assistance towards learning sufficient parenting skills to take care of the child. HELD: The child was placed in the permanent care and custody of the mother and the grandmother, who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion, and the child's maternal grandmother who is a pediatrician, who is more stable. The mother's application for leave to apply for custody was dismissed pursuant to s. 42(1)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act. The court heard evidence from other family members that the mother was able to support the mother's efforts to get custody. The father, V.M., who is convicted of child abuse, was sentenced to 30-39 months imprisonment for the conviction. He had the care of his son in an unsupervised situation. The maternal grandmother was better set up in her home to receive the child (age, health, death) than she was in the maternal grandparents' home. Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, she has always exercised proper parenting skills.","The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody.

"This appeal involves consideration of s. 31(1) of the Probate Act, C. 359 R.S.N.S.(1989) and a request from both counsel for the respondents that the appeal be dismissed with costs to be awarded on a solicitor and client basis. HELD: The appeal is dismissed as a matter of costs respecting the hearing before Justice Carver, for the determination of Feeney. The grounds of appeal are without merit, indeed, without any modicum of merit. The appeal was brought for the sole purpose of delaying the legatees from pursuing their legitimate rights. As such, this proceeding is an abuse of the appeal process.  1)Solicitor and client costs are only awarded in this jurisdiction in rare and exceptional circumstances. 2)The appeal is relevant to consider the matters that gave rise to the appeal. Mr. Saunders' actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which we would class as unconscionable. Those actions go beyond what we might term as merely reprehensible. 3)The Court found no error of law, or principle, with respect to the issues before him and found that his order to reimburse the estate with the money he had taken in September, 1997 and 1998 constituted a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed by him as executor of the estate.","One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.",3_1999canlii2586.txt,"The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act.

"The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendant, who was on salary, was unhappy about being asked to work less hours by her doctor and one of the reasons she was dismissed was because she was not able to qualify for special benefits due to her not having 600 hours of insurable employment. The plaintiff claims back $2,400 from the defendant for repayment of expenses related to her bringing the girl to Canada. The parties never spoke to each other about the money being paid back. The statements of claim dismissed. There is no evidence to support the plaintiff's allegation that the payments were not consented to and agreed to by the defendant, that the plaintiff filed an inaccurate number of hours in the Record of Employment for the plaintiff, that there was no request to pay back, and that there is no record of it, as far as loan documentation goes, as the plaintiff has not made out. As the amount of damages is not known at this time, and the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, the issue of the defendant's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court. If she is not able, the Court will hear evidence on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Lilia.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.

"FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. As the child of a previous relationship had been unemployed for several months, the child's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education was 'unreasonable'. 3) The evidence does not support a finding of intentional unemployment. The child's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment and his ability to publish a newsletter for a period of 2 weeks will represent his total earnings to date in 2004. Other than that contract, he has been actively working towards obtaining a position with the provincial government. 4) Section expenses were not imputed.","This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.",4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support.

"The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's. 66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations (Reg 10)'. The Crown tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine of $200. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty as charged. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on his behalf on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. No one appeared on that date. The Crown was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held. The peace officer testified that the appellant was operating his Hummer with after-market tinted windows on a public highway. The police conducted a breath sample after demand was made. The officer issued a certificate of offence and a demand for $105 was made for the appellant to appear. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. Standard of review is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. In this case, the count cannot be amended so as to breathe life into something that is nullity.

"FIAT: The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal. Recognition of a discount for tax on RRSPs was explicit in the wife's position in her pre-trial calculations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter. The wife having laid out discounted values, one would expect that the husband would have demanded explicit language if he wanted to use unreduced RRSP values to satisfy the Equalization payment. To entertain the husband's proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense in all the circumstances. This is irrelevant in light of the taxable nature of the RRSP funds. 2) The wife's application was directed to the Court of Appeal. The Court ordered that the amount transferred should be increased by a factor of 1.3. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order.","The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application.

"An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the respondent had been required to contribute under the terms of the policy issued to the appellant. The appellant had sought to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not responsible for the policy. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was never issued to Guardian and there was no contractual relationship between Guardian and the Province, nor between Guardian's and Hartford, which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire loss suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford. We reject the argument that there should not be an implied obligation to contribute by the respondent to the payment of the fire damage. The evidence as to the unreported amount paid by the applicant was not supported by the evidence.","This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant.

"A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The RCMP officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates and noticed that one of the pockets of the accused was bulging and he asked the accused if he would empty his pockets. The officer told the accused that once he had arrested the accused, he could perform a search incidental to the arrest. The accused said that this was his practice to ask persons suspected of bringing in an over quantity of alcohol to relinquish the same in which event the person would not be charged. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all charges. 1)The Court was satisfied that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had consented to the search. However, it was not satisfied that there were any exigent circumstances upon which he could have obtained a warrant. Further, the Court raised the following issues relating to the conduct of the authorities, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982: 1)Was the accused detained in an arbitrary detention contrary to s.10(b) of the Charter; 2)If the question 'where are you going' was innocuous social conversation, that it had nothing to do with determining whether the accused required any assistance. The question 'what is in the back of the van' had no effect. The Court questioned whether the officer pulled the van up to the rental van in an investigative mode; 3)Had the accused been detained and asked to participate in the seizure of evidence; 4)Had he been properly informed of the expungement of the evidence by the arresting officer; 5)Had it been necessary to expend time and effort trying to locate the evidence in order to arrest the accused; 6)Whether the officer was properly advised of the impungement or whether the search was unreasonable. Counsel argued the officer must provide the accused with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel without delay. There were no officers in the RCMP detachment that day. In Young, supra, the police officer questioned the accused about a block from business premises which had been broken into. The court recognized there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The Crown acknowledged there was no argument advanced that Cst. McLaughlin, as officer, was acting in a manner that interfered with the lawful authority of the RCMP to detain an individual. Counsel relied on R","The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.",1999canlii12687.txt,The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police.

The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for the use of a 'Director Tax Services Office' when the duties of the Director are performed by the Department. The Director Tax Services should not have been convicted of an offence allegedly contrary to s. 330 of the act when the information set out an offence contrary to ss. 326 of the Code. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the ACT. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment of no importance. The appellants had filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents filed. The demand for a return filed was not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the Certificate of Registration was not issued by the Director Taxation. The Certificate of Validation was issued under the Interpretation Act. HELD: The appeal was refused. 1)Section 326(13) of the Income Tax Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. The person is charged as though he committed the offence and the Crown is not required to stipulate precisely whether he committed that offence as principal or party. 2)The Court could find no error in finding no error. The certificate of registration was not a complete answer to the argument advanced by the appellants. 3)The service of a demand to file a GST return upon a business operation in the City of Regina is clearly an appropriate act to be performed by a Director of the Regina Tax Services. It was open to the court to find that the Chief of Verifications and Collections was not authorized by the Income tax Act when the Information set out such an offence. 4)There was no evidence to support the appellant's contention that the returns purportedly filed were defective but not qualify for a fair trial. The appellant's claim that the notice was signed by some person authorized to sign is not supported by the evidence. 5)The Certificate of Disclosure was not an issue in this case. The Court was not seeking to determine the adequacy of the Certificate for compliance with the relevant statutory requirements. 6)The certificate of claim was not filed. 7)The appellant had no claim to the right to rely on the signature of a director.,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act.

"FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)It is well established that jurors may enter the trial with biases. But the law presumes that jurors' views and biases will be cleansed by the trial process. It therefore does not permit a party to challenge their right to sit on the jury because of the existence of widespread bias alone. 2)A reasonably serene environment is still possible in Saskatoon. The majority of media reports are over a year old. There is no evidence that the media reports have created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. The more recent reports are generally factual references to the progress of the case. There are safeguards in the system to cleanse the jurors' eyes. 3)The onus is on the accused to establish by evidence that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the closest judicial district. In the circumstances, despite the examples of media coverage referred to in the affidavits, there is no question that the accused has not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application.","FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.",c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code.

He sought leave to appeal from his sentence of 9 months incarceration plus 2 years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. An information alleging three counts of criminal negligence causing bodily damage contrary to s. 221 was alleged. He plead guilty in Provincial Court to three counts for dangerous driving. At the same time, he consented to a driving prohibition for a period of 3 years being imposed pursuant to s258(2) of the Code. The three Criminal Code convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law, which was demonstrated by the appellant's failure to control his anger. The sentence imposed on the basis of the three convictions combined with the absence of evidence of misconduct in the operation of a motor vehicle as egregious as that displayed by appellant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The force of the trial judge to impose a sentence cannot be limited by the submission of Crown counsel or a joint submission resulting from a plea bargain. 2)The mitigating factors were not mentioned in the brief reasons for sentence given orally at the conclusion of the argument. 3)The court recognized that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and accordingly imposed a sentence similar to that imposed in MacEachern.","After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs.

"The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to renew the application. The issue was whether the judge should have granted the amendment because this case did not fall into any of the specific powers to amend in the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to set aside was allowed. The decision on whether the amendment should be granted was not appealed. The matter was left to the Supreme Court to decide. 1)Limidity of the Rules in relation to limitation periods has limited the Court's discretion to grant the amendment; the Court must consider all relevant matters. 2)The limitation period has intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant's delay has prejudiced the defendant's defence. Lombard should receive notice. 3)The appeal was granted in part. The Court could not find a reason to deny the application but could not say that the chambers judge had not exercised his discretion. 4)Limitations may be used to permit an amendment to be granted in the absence of notice to a party. 5)The Court could only grant leave if it was apparent that the proposed new defendant had a reasonable basis to oppose being joined. 6)The issue was not whether the expiry of the limitation period trumps the power to amend, but whether it is just to grant it.","Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer.

"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arose. In concurrence with the court of justice, that a new Trial was ordered. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The Chief judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. 2)The evidence failed to convince the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 3)If indeed the judge had found that under s.(213) the Actus Reus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. 4)The Court of Appeal was ordered to restore the conviction and new trial ordered.",The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution.

"The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. HELD: The Court found that the accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence under s. 7 of The Charter as a result of a lack of full disclosure.  1) The officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and, in the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this case, the trial was unfair in a way that the Court was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or through exclusion. 2) The second disclosure concern, related to the undisclosed bottom portion of the Checksheet, stands in different light. In this trial, the officer did know the full content of the Operational Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document, Cst. Pshyk. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in that original document, under the heading Observations on Subject, I am satisfied that Mr. Moore would not have challenged Cst.'Pshyk on his failure to made mention that the appellant's speech was slurred. That is because, had he known the full contents of the original check sheet, he would have known that such a question would inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in the case.  3) The lack of disclosure on what was a critical point in the trial and the time at which this failure was discovered rendered this trial to be unfair in the way it was not remedied by an indefinite adjournment or disclosure order. The officer was not asked to answer any question as to the correctness of the probity of the report or the adequacy of the disclosure. The Crown lawyer referred to the original Checksheet during the Crown's case and introduced it into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence.  4) The Crown did not provide full disclosure to the court. The Court was satisfied that the officer was asked to make available the full extent of the information requested by the Crown in its response to the charge and subsequent re-","The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out.

"The appellant appealed the decision of the Chambers judge dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process.

"This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal set aside; conviction entered on the charge of common assault. The trial judge erred in finding that the respondent did not have the minimal intent required for the offence of assault. He mischaracterised the assault as being an assault. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the Crown must prove an accused applied force intentionally in connection with a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess a minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence.

"The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the Chambers court also included child maintenance issues. The father argues that the Chambers judges erred by finding the children's wishes to be irrelevant. The parties requested a viva voce hearing on the basis that the material was too controverted to allow a decision to be made on affidavit evidence alone. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a maximum contact principle alone for a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting. 2) The evidence regarding the childrens wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the Chambers Judge to decline to make a finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed. The Chambers Judge was entitled not only to take into account the change in circumstances but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the children’s needs and needs. This was an error by the Chambers Court in that it gave too much weight to irrelevant considerations, controverted affidavit evidence, inadmissible evidence and short term matters which did not have direct application to the children. 3) The Court found that the evidentiary threshold necessary to make decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence had been reached. The chambers judge did not err in her approach in crafting the decision. The Court of Appeal was unable to intervene in this matter solely because of the error of law.","The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment.

"A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action against the three doctors was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no evidence either in fact or in law supporting the existence of a trust or a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The arrangement was entirely voluntary. The plaintiff was neither the originator nor the party to it. The plan was introduced by the doctors and, to that extent, only co-operated with the doctors in its implementation. When it operated well it delivered to the hospital, without the plaintiff's involvement, the hospital would have suffered serious consequences. 2)There is no basis either in law or in legal evidence supporting either of the above mentioned relationships. The relationship between doctors and the hospital is entirely voluntary and no evidence was brought into evidence that it compromised the hospital's standards or authority. 3)The court dismissed the action against Crouse and Kirsch as being totally voluntary. 4)The plaintiff had no standing to sue the doctors for breach of contract or negligent misrepresentation.","The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.

HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.",b_2001skqb124.txt,The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board.

"The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time of trial was an inmate. The police officer testified that he had asked the doctor if he could take the blood from the accused. The doctor's evidence was that he thought the taking of the blood for law enforcement purposes would not endanger his life or health. When questioned as to continuity, the Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer at the moment he decided to make the demand had nothing to do with the Crown's findings of doubt but with reasonable and probable grounds. HELD: 1)The facts were in the officer's mind at the relevant time and place as they were taken conclude that the doctor was of the opinion that the taking would not affect the life of the victim. 2)The Court concluded the facts as a whole constituted reasonable and likely grounds for the Crown to conclude that a reasonable and reasonable demand was made in the circumstances. 3)There was no evidence to suggest that the officer had second thoughts about taking the blood samples but that his mind was not focused on the needs of his patient. 4)The court found that the medical practitioner had no real recollection either of who actually took the blood or of signing the second certificate. The physician clearly would not have done so if he were of the view that the Taking of Blood for Law Enforcement Contempts would Not Endanger the Life of the Accused. The Court also found that in assessing the evidence as whole, the officer was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the examination of the vials and the analysis of the sample would not be endangerful. The Certificate of Analysis was not accepted. 5)The medical practitioner's testimony that he relied on police officers and trusted them was not supported by the evidence. The certificate was signed by the doctor. The medical practitioner testified that she did not recall the doctor signing the first certificate. 6)The Certificate of Review was not considered by the Court as a valid grounds to rely on a second opinion as found by the Crown as to whether the doctor gave second opinions as required by the law.","The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.",7_2001canlii346.txt,"In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician.

"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused argued the admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute as it would violate the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights. HELD: The Court held the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body was not raised as part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making a demand. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. The Court found the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes until the demand was made for a breath sample and a failure to obtain an ASD. During that time, he was detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. The delay was of relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel, but the Court found that the officer's grounds for demanding the samples were irrelevant as he did not have a watch and the breath sample was not available at the time of the demand. Finally, the accused acknowledged that he had not had a chance to speak with legal counsel prior to making the demand, but acknowledged that his right to counsel under s. 9 of the Charter had been infringed and that he should have been given an opportunity to seek counsel.","The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis.

"The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended. The adjudicator found the appellant's evidence to be more credible than the Crown's and three other witnesses testified to it. The appellant also appealed his convictions for mischief, arguing that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, or to make findings of credibility based on the evidence of the Crown witnesses. Appeal allowed; conviction stayed; new trial ordered. The trial judge should have made clear findings of credible based on his evidence. The evidence before the adjudicating judge was clearly capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise reasonable doubt. The decision of the adjudicate was not based on a failure to address this issue but rather on the independent evidence of three witnesses who testified they had seen the appellant get out of the driver's side of the vehicle and rush into the service station; the adjudicators' analysis was not constructive or convincing.","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.

"The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs which were in their possession of the proposed appellant but claimed by the proposed appellant. The proposed appellors sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 406-10. The respondent provided an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $12,000 as security in accordance with Rule 408. The sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs then in her possession. She applied to the Court of Queen'sBench for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her on the grounds the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. The chambers judge granted the application, finding the affidavit in support contained false or misleading information and to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of the process. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. While the wording of the Rules may be vexing to some, they are not in the nature of frivolous appeal. While they are very narrow and not in their vitiements, they raise a very important issue of the Court's day. While it is not plain that the chambers judge in chambers is required to determine the merits of the application in light of the wording in s. 407(2) of the Queen's B Rules, they do raise a fairly important issue in the Court.

"The accused is charged with aggravated assault and breach of a peace officer. The accused pled guilty to two counts and in the information, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertaking. At the argument stage of this trial, the Crown indicated they were not seeking a conviction on the count related to the alleged assault on the complainant. HELD: The Court was left with the issue of whether or not a defence of self-defence was available to the accused and whether it was properly identified and therefore properly acting as a police officer in the line of duty. The Court found that the accused was guilty of both counts. The first count was a breach of the peace and the injury to the complainant's ankle which was a broken nose. The second count was an assault on a public officer which was clearly a wounding as the complainant was on his back on the boulevard beside the van and was being assaulted by the accused when the accused exited the vehicle and literally flew at the complainant, flailing his arms and fists and as result of him defending himself from the assault he fell and the assault resulted in his ankle being broken.","The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street.

"The plaintiff, through her numbered company, assumed the operation of a motel by lease with an option to purchase. The lessor, Metro Computerized Bookkeeping, made several changes in the interests of the plaintiff, resulting in the plaintiff's termination of her employment with the defendant. The defendant counterclaimed for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. At issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to return the $20,000 security deposit from the defendant and whether she should seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The plaintiff's application was dismissed. 1)The delay in this case was full nine years after the cause of action arose. 2)The defendants thought that all outstanding issues with Cluett had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations. 3)The elapse of 9 years raises a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been. The action was not commenced until October 2001, a full nine year later. There was no evidence that the plaintiff sought or received legal advice during this time. It seems that this circumstance relates to a disability other than that alluded to in MacDonald's letter of 30 October 1992. This also seems to relate more to a personal injury situation. 4)The plaintiff's lawyer advised her to call Eric Corkum, who had advised her not to pursue any action against Metro if the deposit was not returned.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.

"FIAT. The defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court or alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act for an ordered order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor. The applicants recognized that if the plaintiff was found to be incompetent and the action was discontinued, or the defendants were successful in their defence, that they would be at risk of not being able to collect taxable costs against the plaintiff. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetencies. It would be inappropriate for the court to order a single examination for determination of an issue where it would be unwise to act on a single recommendation. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to s.38.3 of the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed.","FIAT.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate.

FIAT: The action commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act (the Act) and is now represented by an amended Statement of Claim. The application seeks a discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and/or Rule 173 of the QS Bench Rules of Court. The applicants argue that this action and these proceedings are an abuse of the court's process and that the court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. HELD: The Court acknowledges the continuing challenges that are raised with respect to the judicial management and handling of multi-jurisdictional class actions. The Court also notes that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be considered by the Court during the certification application of this class action. These concerns may be of some assistance to the Court as it is now 'no costs' jurisdiction providing for the certification of a national multi- jurisdictional class action on an 'opt-out' basis.,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v.

"The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent also sought custody, custody, divorce with payment for extraordinary expenses and an ordered that the petitioner's equity be postponed while she was working and/or obtained a new home. The husband counter-petitioned for child support, child care expenses and a division of matrimononial assets. HELD: The petitioner was to have primary care of the children, with the exception of one child, with access to the matron home when the youngest one is 21 years old and the husband's current medical plan does not cover orthodontic treatments. The child support payments were to be paid from the Maintenance Enforcement Program. The wife's request to have the husband postpone the child support payment for orthodONTIC treatment was not granted as it would cause her to lose the child's future income. The father's equity was to be retained by the Trust Fund for the purpose of managing the children's future needs and the balance of the matrionial home was to solely be held by the Fund. The mother's request for a reduction in the value of the husband’s equity in that home was also refused as it was a rental property. The court ordered that if the husband could not pay the mortgage and the value in the home was reduced by more than $100,000, the Trust fund would be required to pay the balance to the husband and it would be impossible for him to contribute proportionately. The parties’ relationship was already strained and it was important to maintain a semblance of normalcy in the marriage.","The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age.

"The Trustee sought an order prohibiting law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be a creditor of that bankrupt. The Bank wanted to have its counsel nominated as solicitors for it. The solicitor for the Bank opposed the application on the grounds that there were significant areas of conflict with the interests of the Bank and that it should not be in a position where it could even appear to be influenced by the bank in making that decision. In this case, the solicitor argued that the mere existence of a claim by a creditor as against the petitioning creditor cannot per se be grounds for removing counsel.

"FIAT. The plaintiff claims his creditor wrongfully converted monies after full and final settlement of his account was agreed upon. In addition, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages for the defendant's 'high-handed and malicious behavior'.

"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child.

Each alleges that the middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA samples from both the male and the female are premature but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised that it is so advised. The paragraphing format used in the present applications is confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding.

The probative benefits of DNA analysis are concerned, but the crucial determination will be whether the father and mother have the requisite number of matching DNA characteristics; the DNA of the baby would then provide further confirmation or negation of the relationship.

'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable.

"This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant is a First Nations faculty member who is First Nations. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom. The allegation had to do with the withdrawal of an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at a symposium. The Board of Governors met in April and the applicant received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina. That meeting ended with no decision having taken place regarding the matter raised in the applicant's letter. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 1) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member.  2) There is no question that the applicant violated the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the Board was acting in its capacity as Chair of the University's Board and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. 3) The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom in the second paragraph under the heading NATURE OF DISPUTE. These actions by FNUC and its Board are an abuse of authority and are harassing and intimidating actions against the respondent. In addition, the actions by the Board have interfered with the academic liberty of the applicant in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement.","Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties.

After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention.

At no time on that day or on any of the days up to and including April 30, 2004 did the petitioner return the court's calls and he confirmed his availability for a phone conference.","After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material. The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise. The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant. The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place.

"The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by the Bank of Canada. The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to the respondent. The respondent had made no business decisions relating to the lease and it was not until December 2001 that it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that it realized that the equipment leased from the Bank would be used by the respondent in its manufacturing process. The bank registered a financing statement in its personal property registry. HELD: The Court found that the Bank was'regularly engaged in the business of leasing' within the meaning of s.2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore it was entitled to the exemption from the registration requirements of s3. The lease was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year', and it required registration.

HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act.

"FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago, the mother unilaterally moved with the children from Nokomis to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. That move was reversed in January 2012, and that issue was adjourned pending the receipt of the custody/access report. HELD: 1) The mother has always been the primary caregiver to the children. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. 2) Even on an interim basis the court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's best interests. This is not a balancing act; rather, it is a fresh consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the needs of the children, and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. There was nothing suggesting that the children would benefit from a new sibling joining them in their lives. 3) There was no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour while he was incarcerated.","The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children.

"A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the decision of the Commission was quickly made, did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented, and was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions. The Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty.HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court adopts the third ground of appeal. The appeal incorporates the relevant issues set out in s. 22 of the Real Estate Trading Act (RETA) and the fourth grounds. It is the Court's view that there are only three standards of review and that reasonableness should not lead a reviewing court infer bad faith or that no legally valid reasons existed. The standard of review is one of correctness. While adequacy depends upon the context and there may be no precise single test of adequacy, reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors. In this case, the respondent received information that the applicant had fabricated documents to cover negligence in conducting her legal action. The applicant must complete the new Salesperson Licensing course within 30 days of this decision.","A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee.

The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another.

"This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to issue an order requiring the receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. Also, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any agreement for Sale within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v). Counsel for the appellant gave the order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court. The respondent was ordered to pay the appellant costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of costs.Leave to appeal was allowed. The appeal would be allowed and an order of the Court to issue directing return of the goods or payment of their value. The appellant would seek the order in the amount of $15,000. The judge held that once ITI decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the students. He found that ITI had selected the books in issue and therefore, the books delivered to ITI were subject, pursuant to its contract with its students, to provide at its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program.

"The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga. The plaintiffs brought three causes of action and claimed damages over and above what might be referred to as normal damages. The defendants were alleged to have induced the plaintiff to abandon his previous employment and sought damages for actions that amounted to defamation. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were using the contents of this statement of claim in an attempt to prove their allegation that the defendant had defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. The applicants sought the following relief: 1) Rule 13-8 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for the striking of portions of the paragraphs that appear to be plead facts. 2) Rule 7-9 is similar to former Rule 139(1) of the former Rule 173 which provides in part that a pleading or other document is to be struck. These facts are material to the plaintiffs' case as they are necessary to adequately define the nature of the action and to any moral damages flowing from it. 3) The defendants plead facts which, if proven, would establish they were fully aware that the plaintiffs were in no way responsible for any acts of intimidation and harassment and that they dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. As such, they are irrelevant to the plaintiff's action in defamation. 4) The pleadings do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. 5) The paragraphs contain references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club which would lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff is referring to them. 6) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision to the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 7) Ibid.","Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp.

"The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions and child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines and in the amount of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses. Prior to the 2009 consent order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the father for increased child maintenance but had resisted such requests indicating lack of income to provide any additional amount. The mother now applied for a retroactive award of retroactive child support. HELD: The order was granted. The court found that the father had 'effective notice' that his child support was deficient and that the mother had 'directed' him to make further contributions. The Court found that given the father's dramatic increase in salary and the fact that he had not shown any improvement in his income in the years prior to the separation, there had to be a reasonable reason for delay in the application.

The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient.

The Court held that the exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at the initial voir dire as there had not been any evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. Therefore, it was not possible to enter into s.24(2). The accused's application was allowed to proceed on to the trial proper. The issues were to be determined as follows: 1) the issue of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s.

"The plaintiff rented paint sprayer from a shop which was owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. At issue was the defendant's liability forfailure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using anairless paint sprayers. The plaintiff suffered a partial loss of an index finger when he inadvertently placed his finger in front of the nozzle. He sought to retain as much of the finger as possible, claiming loss of income, past and future. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $18,789 plus $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest. 1)The non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated. An ordinary user of this sprayer would not appreciate the disastrous consequences of his failing to take adequate precautions to protect himself and his property. 2)Given the plaintiff's unique situation and the fact that he was unable to function at his job for about 3 months after the amputation and required an extra man to help him with the painting project, the plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of inflation for all the years 1989 to 1994 because there was noexcuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for six years. Had the claim been adjudicated in timely fashion, only a few years of inflation would have intervened.","The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor.

"The father appealed the June 4, 1984 custody decision of his son to his father. The trial judge refused to accept the testimony of the father's expert witness who testified as to relationships within the family and the mother's interpretation of events.

"The landlord appealed a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the claims and evidence of the tenants. The Court found no reviewable error by the Hearing Officer. The decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended in part to compensate for inconvenience and aggravation, and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses. Both awards were reasonable on both fact and law, accordingly.","The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable.

"The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the applicant and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The trial judge found that the respondent did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(the P.P.S.A.) and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s. 29(2). The Credit Union appeals this decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Section 28(2)(a) contemplates the secured creditor (Lanson) authorizing the debtor to deal with the secured debtor and that the buyer must know of the authorization. 2) The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. With respect to the facts, in our opinion, he was in error.  3) The issue is reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized the sale. The authorization to sell must be given prior to the sale and that dealing would include resale. 4) The fact the debtor failed to pay his secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 5) The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd. 6) The same issues are discussed.","The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.",9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2).

"FIAT. The applicant sought an order nisi for sale of a 10 acre parcel of land bordering an ostrich farming business. The amount owing on the mortgage dates back to 1988. The Farm Credit Corporation as second mortgagee in the amount of $36,000 had been paid out. HELD: The application was adjourned.

"The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines.

The police had intercepted the stolen vehicle at the station and arrested the accused. The accused argued that the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs and was, therefore, incident to arrest.

"The accused, who was related to the complainant, was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent. Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens rea. If the activity were consensual, there was nothing to consent to. If not, the accused lacked the mens for sexual assault. The evidence of the accused's daughter and the accused being in a good mood at the time of the activity raised reasonable doubt about the complainant's non-consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not been drinking and that she was capable of consenting.","There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication.

"This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, the Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorkdal. The appellant contended that Justice Rothery had erred in granting the motion to withdrew the case. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Bjorksdale Lions club with the assistance of the BjORKdale Fire Department. The respondent suffered burns to various parts of his body. His right hand and arm were badly burned. He was helped to the ground by a flagman who noticed the splash of liquid or gasoline in the interior of the vehicle. Having come to stop the vehicle it was found to have been struck by the flames. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. The damage could not be seen to have caused or been caused or contributed to by the respondents. 2)The appellant took the position that he had made a prima facie case of liability against each of the defendants based on their having breached their respective duties of care and having caused or caused or contribute to his injury. Alternatively, he contended that she had erered in her award of costs. The parties agree that the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the standard of care required of persons in the organization and conduct of demolition derbys, nor any expert evidence of that standard of caring required of each of them. The issue reduces to whether she applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. The evidence adducing by the appellants may be taken for the purposes at hand to establish the following, though it may be noted that there were a number of inconsistencies and weaknesses in the evidence: The fault or no fault of the respondent for failing to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the damage could have been caused by the defendants and not been caused to by by the Respondents. 3)The appeal was dismissed to the fullest extent.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents.

"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation with regard to the election of the members of the Board with a view to determining the voting rights of the commercial owners. It found that principles of contract interpretation had no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of a condominium bylaw. As there were only seven positions on the board, a vote was required. The commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three persons for election to the Board and the board members were entitled, pursuant to s. 3.3(c) of the bylaw, to vote on the remaining four positions on that board. The respondent directors were elected as a result of the vote. The Court found that bylaws as they were enacted in the 1960s and 1970s did not provide for the equitable distribution of voting rights among the owners of the three commercial units. Accordingly, all commercial owners in the condominium community were not entitled to vote for or against anyone nominated by them. The Board was not bound by s. 41 of the Act.","The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.

"The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine. He was only one month into a probation order after having been convicted of the same offence, but with a limited criminal record. The accused had stopped selling the drug in a community park, where many young people gather for social events. The park is the most popular gathering place for older children and adolescents. The Court found that the accused was cruising around in his vehicle with the cocaine in the back. The court sentenced the accused to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The offender was only 1 month into his probation order when he was arrested for possession for purposes of the trafficking cocaine, and had only a probation violation. The Crown had indicated that the trafficking was likely to be violent, and the accused would benefit from any more time in actual custody. The sentencing judge placed the accused on a six month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. The amount of cocaine that the youth had possessed was significant and the fact that he was cruising in his car with the drug was enough to make it clear that the crime was being committed in a public place. The aggravating factors were the accused's youth record, the fact he had stopped drinking alcohol, the presence of drugs in his community park and his failure to pay attention to the fact the accused had a criminal record that included possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The youth was only 21 years old at the time of his conviction and had a record of 39 convictions. The criminal record had not been considered aggravating in the circumstances.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody.

The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province.

"The landlord applied for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were IN breach of the covenant to pay rent and the alleged failure to maintain proper weed control. The issues with respect to the hail damage and the claims for repair were far in excess of those provided for in clause 3.1 of the lease. 1)Under the landlord's covenants in the lease, clause 5.2, the landlord shall be the plaintiff and the defendants in any action and the Rules of Court generally will govern the conduct of that action. 2)The payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.3) and because there was a condition to thelease wherein the tenant promised to fix the damagraeto in a timely manner by virtue of a promise made in 1995. The hail damage may allow the landlord to claim in damages against the applicant but it cannot be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the landlord and tenant act. 3)The remaining allegations raised by Russell with respectto the other alleged breaches of the covenants by the landlords were not determined summarily but should bedecided in an action (Vogelgesang and Kennedy v. WilliamsHoldings Ltd. (1981), 15 Sask. R. 336).

"The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. The parties had three children, all now adults living independently of their parents. The applicant supported them from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by a divorce judgment, to 1993 when it was discontinued. In 1995 they agreed on an equal division of their matrimonial property and consented to divorce judgment which ordered support of $1,500. The support was not time limited nor was it expressed to be subject to variation by the Court should the financial position of either party change substantially in the future. HELD: 1) There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed and it was essential that he know now what his future obligations were. 2) The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the original order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated.  3) The application of these legal principles did not warrant termination nor a reduction of the quantum of the support. However, the respondent could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity. 4) Considering all the changes to the needs and means of the parties since the divorce, the position of the applicant was now worse while the respondent's was better. An adjustment period is called for in the circumstances.","The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home.

"FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be reduced. Her costs were reduced by 15 percent when failed claims for punitive and exemplary damages were treated as separate causes.  2) The expert medical evidence introduced by the defendant was of marginal value to the plaintiff. The costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. 3) Expert medical evidence is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs such as this one.

The court reviewed the guidelines laid down in Electronic Superstore Ltd. v. Geransky Brothers Construction Ltd. (1991), 90 Sask. R. 150 (Q.B.) and found no personality, psychological or psychiatric disorders. 6) The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. 7) Costs in the amount of $1,000 awarded to either party were not excessive.

The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.

"The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The RCMP had previously applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants. The search of the accused's residence, the seizure of the money (and other items) and Smith's arrest were the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada including evidence allegedly implicating the accused. The investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The accused was the only occupant of the premises. During the search, the RCMP observed movement inside the residence and noticed that the accused was in the entrance hallway. The police arrested the accused and found a suitcase containing $750,000.00 Canadian cash and some American cash in the shower of the main floor bathroom. The Crown contends that only if both warrants are found to be invalid is s. 24 of the Charter engaged. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the warrants, is nevertheless commented upon because of the bearing that it may have upon any s. 23(2) Charter analysis that may need to be undertaken. HELD: The Court held that both the search warrants were valid and that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of them. The Court found that the RCMP officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the C and DSA and that his endorsement of the Code was non-conscriptive within the meaning of R. v. Buhay, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), 1 S.C.R. 607. Accordingly, the admission would not render the trial unfair. It would be unfair to the trial judge to deprive the accused of his Charter rights.","The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.",4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search.

"This is an application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the application was dismissed. The Defense position is that the accused was not fully informed of the nature of the allegation, which was part of his motivation for pleading guilty, nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to that allegation. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Court was not persuaded that the Court's test regarding awareness of the consequences of a guilty plea extends to the impact of a plea on a decision of the Supreme Court Family Division regarding access to the child. 2)The evidence related to the accused's ability to communicate in English and purported admission of the offence and an expression of remorse could in part have been motivated by the troubles he’d caused his family. 3)The accused’s evidence regarding his awareness of consequences of his plea to sexually assaulting his son on decision of SCDF regarding access was not credible. The standard of proof is the civil burden. 4)There was no evidence the accused offered an innocent explanation of the plea to the alleged assault to the defendant as he testified.","The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault.

"The primary issue on this appeal was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in a youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging that the same offences had occurred when he was an adult.(1) The Court considered the effects of the transition from the Juvenile Delinquents Act to the Young Offenders Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). It was common ground that youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to any offences which occurred prior to the date of their commission. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law.  1) There are a number of pre-requisites for a transfer hearing, including whether the accused should have assumed jurisdiction, the time of the alleged offences, the charges, and the appropriate forum.  2) The jurisdiction of the Youth Court is determined by s.5(1) of the Act. It does not depend on averments in the information or on proof of age. The focus of the hearing is not on guilt or innocence and at this stage of the proceedings the rules of evidence applicable to criminal proceedings are not strictly applied. The Court reviewed the various types of evidence and found that the accused could not be tried in either youth court or ordinary court due to the uncertainty as to when the alleged acts occurred. 3) The issues before the Youth court on transfer hearing are whether the Court adopted the concept of universal jurisdiction or whether it was the Court's responsibility to determine the proper jurisdiction for the charges. In this case, the primary issue is whether the judge was correct in declining jurisdiction on the basis he was unable to determine whether the alleged crimes occurred when they occurred. It would appear there are no adverse consequences from such an order. 4) The issue of whether a writ of mandamus should issue will of necessity follow the result of the determination of the first issue.","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.",b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult.

"FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born August 28, 2005. The petitioner was to have his child support payment as set out in the February 2007 parenting judgment be varied to provide for a four day on and four day off rotation to the parenting schedule and the deletion of paragraph 2 of the parenting judgment from the respondent's final decision making provision. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that has been followed. The respondent as single parent was able to access the children 50% of the time. The child support application in this regard was dismissed. HELD: The application to vary is dismissed. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued. The applicant has not shown a material change of circumstance. The Court must also consider the context of the petitioner's 2009 income tax return. The requirement of a material or change of circumstances for an application to apply to vary cannot serve as an indirect route of appeal from the original custody order.","The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children.

The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order.

"The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998. The marriage had been established as a result of their divorce.

Maintenance for the wife was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines.  3)Spousal support was set-off at the date of the petition by rollover from the respondent's account to the petitioner's account and directed that he pay promptly as incurred his share of the shortfall.  4)The parties were ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of the petitioner to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the respondent and to correspond to that amount on one evening each week.  5)Each party was to contribute its proportionate share of any orthodontic treatment expenses that is not covered by insurance with the cost of any major repairs to be split equally.  6)The wife was awarded leave to apply for an adjustment to her s.21(1) disability pension.  7)The husband was to pay $485 per month subject to any additions pursuant to s.7.

In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends.

"The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court retained the interest they acquired in their own pensions and the parties agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The mother sought to have the father's access to take place every second weekend and the father make child support payments in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines by paying a table amount in his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost.

HELD: The current parenting arrangements are in effect. The parties have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest. The more specific the decision is, the more restrictions are placed in the way of the parents continuing their successful performing of this function.","The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis.

"The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for shared parenting. Since that time, the children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is that (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement because he has not met the obligation to pay $2,000 per month as required by s. 15.2(b) of the Divorce Act and (c) variation of an agreement incorporated into an order under s. 17. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) The Court's considerations are the same when called upon to set aside a separated agreement regardless of whether the application arises at the time it was issued, or in the context of an application to vary a Corollary Relief judgment. 2) There is no suggestion herein that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding. The Agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on June 17, 2009. 3) The respondent has filed financial statements identified as Exhibit B and as Exhibit C. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. In them, the Court admits that once material change has been found, court has a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered, based solely on the factors set out in s.17(7). 4) In this case, the respondent has agreed to pay only child support based on the tables reflecting his income of approximately $30,000. The child support obligation in that circumstance would be $750 per month. 5) The petitioner acknowledges that there are arrears on the mortgage on the home and that she is at risk of losing her program of study if the husband discontinues or does not resume payment of the Spousal support.","The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).",2_2009nssc364.txt,"At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment.

The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. Actions of the Crown were not involved. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. The delay of six months was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the the accused. The reason for the delay was not established. 2)There is no evidence that any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice are something that he could overcome. The conditions of release he is subject to are not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. The Court found that the accused had not suffered actual prejudice and the conditions of his release were not so onerous as result in anything but the usual prejudice over and above that suffered by other accused charged with similar offences.,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time.

"The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1994. There are two children of the marriage, Chad and Ryan. Chad is in high school and is dependant. The parties were paying child support and the matrimonial home was being sold. At issue was whether the child support should be transferred to a locked-in RRSP or sold. HELD: 1)The pension plan administrator for the Regina City Police Pension Plan testified that he understood that the division of pension on the breakdown of the spouse's marriage'must not reduce the member's commuted value to less than 50 per cent of the members' commuted Value prior to the division'. This requirement was met by an order that the home be sold and the proceeds, if any, be divided equally between the parties. 2)The wife had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. She subordinated her employment demands to her family obligations. 3)Spousal support was not ordered for the 21 years of marriage but the husband was ordered to pay child support of $260 per month for so long as Chad was a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and he was a full-time student at a recognized educational institution for a reasonable period.","Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity.

The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP.

"HELD: The court held that the parents could not resolve the custody issue and defer to the court to determine where the child's primary residence was located. The court found that the petitioner was a competent and loving mother and that the child was resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The child was to continue her education and socialization needs while in the petitioner's parent's home. The respondent was to obtain a mental health warrant and obtain de facto possession of the child for three weeks at a time during the school year. The petitioner was to apply for a shared parenting license and obtain a copy of the parenting report prepared by the petitioner and the mother. The mother was to appear in Provincial Court on May 10, 2013. HELD: 1) The Court held that it would be appropriate for the petitioner to be the primary parent of her child. The Court gave the respondent eight recommendations. These recommendations were based upon the totality of evidence presented at the trial. 2) The court moved independently as trier of the fact, selecting the evidence the court considers factual and relevant to the issue or issues to be determined. Once the court had considered these factors, the court applied the same principles to the law.","The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.",c_2013skqb180.txt,"The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school.

"The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo). The plaintiff claims the Spreader was 'entirely unfit for spreading compost' and did not meet the warranties imposed by operation of the Act. HELD: The action is dismissed. Costs are awarded to the defendant. The plaintiff has not established to my satisfaction, on a balance of probabilities, that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in s. 36(2) of the Agricultural Implements Act.

"The Court directed the Crown to seek from the relevant police agencies or prosecution service the police reports and witness statements, including statements of the accused in respect of two Crown witnesses and particular offences for which the accused had previously been convicted. The Crown also directed that the documents be returned to the Court in sealed envelope for delivery. HELD: The Court granted the application.

"The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The accused submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was required to address s. 91 of the Code. There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as aweapon. 2) The Crown cannot rely on the accepted evidence that the weapon is a decorative item or, in the same manner that a knife, like a multitude of other things (e.g. baseball bats, hatchets, pipe wrenches and ice picks) can on occasion be used effectively in fighting offensively or defensively. There is nothing to show that the knife in question was designed or intended for that purpose. When it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other device. 3) On this basis, the trial judge concluded that she had a reasonable doubts that the blade was designed and used to be a weapon. In her decision, the judge properly placed the accused's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon.

"The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. Until recently, the defendant golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In January 2005, the property was purchased by the White City, who entered into an agreement with Great Plains and Lorch Associates Ltd. for the continued use and enjoyment of the property. The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the latest report. HELD: 1) The plaintiff plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years.  2) The Court is not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem. The expert’s report was filed. In that report he made certain recommendations, one of which was to allow the defendants to operate the 9 hole golf course in a manner that caused errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs’ property.  3) The defendants were ordered to pay $18,000 to the plaintiffs for the loss of their lawn for 7 months of the year and $6,500 to the plaintiff for general damages as set out in the affidavits filed.  4) The plaintiffs were ordered not to pay any more money to the defendants for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  5) The defendant was ordered to enter into an indemnity clause in the development agreement between the defendants and the plaintiffs, Cattell and Mack, to prevent them from operating another golf course until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations therein.  6) It would appear that the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude.","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years.

"The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the grounds raised in the original application and instead applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply on one or more of the stronger grounds. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody.

"The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the erection of signs on private property and restricted the use of signs which were not permitted in the downtown core area. The respondents argued that the signs were intrusive and distracting and posed safety concerns to pedestrians and other motorist. The Town argued that since the by laws were rationally connected to the objective and did not prevent advertising, the limits imposed demonstrably justified under s.2 of the Charter. The application was allowed and an order was issued pursuant to 266(3) of the municipal government act directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs to the respondents were $1,500 against all respondents.

"The Municipality sold a property owned by the plaintiff to the defendant, the Municipality. Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the plaintiff, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking declaration as to the validity of the tax sale. The Municipality later sued the plaintiff and the defendant for general damages. The trial judge allowed certain of the purported damages, essentially legitimate cost items relating to the sale, but overturned the trial judge on the claim for legal costs incurred at the first trial, which were set forth as $39,385.82. The grounds for the reversal were that this item of damage was too remote, not foreseeable, and it was not reasonable for that first action to have been embarked upon when the true state of affairs could be discovered upon reasonable investigation. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees and some other items of loss and general damages with interest.

The defendant denied liability for any share in the costs of the Hor Horizontal well.  1) The defendant's claim for lost wages was not supported by the actual drilling costs. 2) The plaintiff was to have its costs paid by the defendant pursuant to s. 505(b) of the CAPL 1981. 3) The court relied primarily on the third paragraph of Clause 301 of Article III of CAPL1981. It relied primarily upon the third and fourth paragraphs of Clause 505(c) of that CAPL81. 4) of which the plaintiff was given notice that it owed $447,535.00 being 110% of the screw pump cost incurred after default notice. The Court found that the defendant was negligent in conducting operations or did it otherwise make improper charges in its accounting. 5) The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff conducted certain operations without authority, was negligent, and made improper charges (Attorney General's Rule No. 3(a)) for the purposes of calculating the total costs of a HorizontalWell. The defendants were to apply the Court's order for an order of this magnitude to the amount owing, the plaintiff's claim that the defendants owed $285,000 for equipment and services, and the defendant owed $142,000 to the defaulting Joint-Operator. The plaintiffs sued for costs arising out of the default notice and sought to have the Court seize the proceeds of sale of the remaining crude oil from the defendants. The Defendant argued that the costs arising from the default in payment should be taxed at the rate of the left over from the original notice.

"FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) A commercial bond is expensive. The risk is too great for a one-year premium. In many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets which equal or exceed the value of the estate to be administered. The court could order more than one bond be given in order to limit the liability of surety to an amount that the court considers reasonable. 2) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for filing a bond contained in s. 55(1). Almost every application would so qualify, because in most cases the nearest relatives always consent. 3) This conclusion is not reflection on the integrity of the applicants which have no reason to doubt. It is not a reflection on their integrity. The fact is this is one of number of similarly contested cases by the public trustee since the new Adult Guardianship and Co-decision-making Act, S.S. 2000, was proclaimed.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).",6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT.

"This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received a cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty.  1) The defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances and that with respect to the failure to yield the defence of due diligence has been established. The court found as a fact that when the defendant commenced his turn, any vehicle lawfully approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision. 2) On a balance of probabilities the defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.",6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act.

"FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: 1) A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. 2) Procedural fairness is an appropriate standard to apply in cases of this nature. 3) The applicants submit the Board failed to meet the common law duty of fairness in passing its resolution for a school closure. There was no prejudice caused by non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election. The Board did not keep minutes of in-camera meetings. There is no suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided. The board ignored, or did not directly respond to all of the submissions made by the opposition. The Court notes that there are a number of considerations that may influence the court. A preliminary examination of the law doesnot suggest a prima fade case.","FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair.

"FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Neither counsel for the respondent nor the petitioner had canvassed the financial records of the numbered corporation, owned by the petitioner's husband, to be disclosed. Counsel for Mr. Overs also sought financial information pertaining to the ranching operation where the petitioner looked after the cattle while the father was operating the truck. Counsel provided no evidence to support the assertion that the petitioner should be required to produce any of the company's financial records. Whether the petitioner could obtain the records would be of no assistance to the respondent because the parties could not afford to pursue such a course and because neither counsel would have the slightest interest in canvassing the premises of the respondent in the absence of the court hearing or to hear from witnesses at viva voce hearing would be a serious issue.","FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her.

"The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that an in-court identification was not necessary; there was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown and service on a lawyer did not satisfy the notice requirement. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)A person was lawfully arrested, detained and released on an Appearance Notice by the arresting officer. That Appearance Notice forms part of the court record and purports to be signed by the accused. On the date specified on that notice the accused was not present but his counsel appeared, waived reading of the allegation, entered a not guilty plea and scheduled a date for trial. This constitutes prima facie proof of identity and there is no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice is the same person who has stood trial. 2)The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible.

In the case at hand, the officer observed an individual operating a motor vehicle and properly obtained his name and date of birth.

No evidence was given as to the nature of that disqualification and the voluntariness of the statements were not in issue.

"The plaintiffs sued the defendants based on a claim that they were negligent and reckless in providing helicopter transportation to and from the work site. The defendants admitted to requesting the service of Kyrgyzstan National Airline to transport the crew to and From the Crash. The weather forecast was wrong about the altitude of the lower edge of the clouds and the visibility and this made it difficult for the crew members to orient themselves visually. The plaintiff alleged that the airfare prices were inflated by the reason the helicopter had been ordered to be paid by the defendant and that the consultant had obtained insurance through KOC to cover the cost of providing the insurance and the associated associated costs. The consultant had received information that the helicopter was unsafe and he arranged for KOC and Cameco to arrange for the use of it. When the plaintiff and the defendant corporations made decisions that were not made by KOC, they were either negligent or ordered to pay premiums through KOS or arranged for the insurance companies to cover their costs. In the event that the insurance company was not aware of the insurance policy, the litigation would have resulted in a loss of profits for the defendant corporation and the plaintiff would have lost her income tax deduction. The defence claimed that the claimed privilege preventing it from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses was not relevant. The Court referred to the fact that the KOC statement of claim referenced Kyrgyzelstan as the originator of the helicopter transport and the date the helicopter became operational as opposed to the defendants' knowledge of the same. The KOC website was not accessible on the internet and there was no information available on the Internet about the status of the e-mail system. The website was inaccessible to the public. The plaintiffs sued for discovery. Finding that the website was unreadable and that there was a record of all memoranda generated by the employees for the purpose of compiling a report on the helicopter transportation and the crash was not an issue. Finding for the plaintiff that the web site was not properly identified was not a sufficient issue. The court found that the websites were not accessible to the general public and that a detailed examination of documents would be necessary to determine their relevance. Finding a finding that the internet connection was not inherently dangerous was not allowed and the questions should be answered. The Certificate of Disclosure was not found. The certificate of absence was not considered. The certificates were not issued to the plaintiff. The remaining certificates were issued to each individual corporation.","FIAT.

The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion."
"The respondent commenced an action for divorce against the respondent on the basis of a property division between the parties and alleged breaches of her entitlement to share in her husband's pension benefits at the time she entered the agreement. The respondent also sought a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. The Respondent sought to vary the consent order on the grounds that it purported to finalize a property divide between the spouses and was incorporated into an Ontario court order. The applicant denied having entered into the agreement and sought to set aside the agreement on the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability. She also sought to divide assets under s. 29 of the Matrionial Property act. Deliberations: Since the respondent is entitled to commence the divorce action in Nova Scotia, she is also entitled to seek division of property under the provisions of the Nova Scotia Matrimon Property Act regardless of where the respondent resides. The Court has jurisdiction to hear the respondent's claim for divorce and her own division of properties under the Act. A consent order is a contract and must be treated as such. The Act does not specifically provide the Court with jurisdiction. The Order incorporates by reference an agreement made between the respondent and the parties in respect of property, division of land and equalization payments. The order was based upon the equitable terms of the agreement incorporating the terms of an equitable and consented to by the respondent. The equitable grounds were not adduced by the Court as they were not filed with the Court and therefore were not supported by the affidavits filed. The court has jurisdiction as provided by the Judicature Act to vary consent orders under the legislation.","The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act.

"Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order providing for the following relief: 1. Variation of child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable thereunder from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by The Act; 2. Cancellation of the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and 3. variation of the access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1)The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The Court was prepared to deal with the remaining $22,993.39 that were accrued during the 1993 to 1997 period by ordering that upon the payment of $5000 on account of the $6,000 accrued prior to December 31, 1998, the balance of the Arrears accrued before that date shall be extinguished. 2)The Court was not prepared to extinguish the arrenars. 3)The parties agreed that the respondent should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 pm on Friday to 6:30 pm on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 4)The arrear for 1993 was $13 million. 5)Upon the respondent paying the sum of $5,000 on the first day of each month thereafter for so long as they remained children within the meaning of the Act and in the circumstances the Court advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.","In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times.

"The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the time of the grievance as front desk manager for the hotel. She filed a grievance alleging that her work hours had been reduced because another employee with greater departmental seniority returned from maternity leave. The respondent employer applied for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision, seeking to have it set aside under s.15(2) of the Arbitration Act. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 is wide enough to encompass the situation, and that its interpretation could not be said to be patently unreasonable. The appellant also argued that the arbitration provisions of the collective agreement which were effective October 1, 1999 and expire September 30, 2002 provide for an indefinite reduction of hours within the department. In issue was whether the respondent employer breached the provisions of s.9:01 (and the application of hotel seniority) so that it could apply to the situation where an individual employee's work hours were reduced due to a personnel change. HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis that the interpretation of the clause which applied to the reduction of the working hours by the hotel was patently unrealistic. It was also found to be inconsistent with the presumed intention of the parties. The court ordered the interpretation and application of the arbitration provision to be set aside.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.",d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave.

"The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. The Court held that the Crown had failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a) of The Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held that in order to obtain a new trial, the Crown must satisfy the Court with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury. The trial judge did not confuse the issue of fact with either the actus reus or the mens rea of dangerous Driving. The jurisprudence currently recognizes four situations. The first is an error of law to make a finding of fact for which there is no evidence. The second is an honest mistake. The judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. The third is an incorrect assumption. The error of fact is not an issue here. The decision of the trial court was based on a misunderstanding of law. The errors of law are not new to the Court. The Supreme Court of Canada held that it is not possible to tell whether a person made a mistake by driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public in all the circumstances. The test that the Court must apply is not new. The majority opinion in R. v. Morin (2006 SCC 26) held that if the Court orders a new Trial, it could rule on the admissibility of Cst. Low's expert opinion evidence.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.",b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.

"Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions were based on Queen's Buhari Rules. The first motion was brought by a Saskatchewan Police officer who had commenced a action within the limitation period as provided in s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act. He was arrested, detained in custody for 4 days, and suspended from his employment as a police officer for 5 months. He commenced this action fifteen months after the stay of proceedings was entered. The second motion was filed by a person claiming breach of contract and professional negligence. The limitation period had only run 1 year following the entry of the stay. The defendant brought this action pursuant to Queen's Rule 173 (e) and (f) of that Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs under double Column V, the claim against the defendant was set aside and the judgment against the plaintiff was set-off against the defendants. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. 2)The Court of Appeal reviewed the various decisions and decisions on file and found that the limitation periods were not limited to events prior to the entering of a stay of Proceedings. It was not necessary to determine whether the action was statute-barred or whether the limitation was extended. 3)The Act does not alter the substantive rights of the to-doctors in the Public Officer Protection Act, save for the limitation of time periods. Limitation of actions is a procedural instrument which allows the Crown to re-commence criminal prosecution during a period of 1 year from the date the entry date of the action. 4)The remaining substantive issues were determined by the Court of Review. Whether the action is barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc, whether assertions of subsequent conduct by at least some of the defendants were made within the meaning of the Act, whether the claim had a prima facie case and whether the plaintiff had given adequate opportunity to tendering amends prior to tendered. 5)The limitations imposed by the Act do not impede the right of the officer to commence a new action. 6)Limitation of Actions are substantive in character and there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188.","FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset.

"Whether a money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act can be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. In this case, the debt owing under a pledged investment certificate, (GCC) was a debt which was a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment.HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Whether a debt owing in a GIC is debt (accruitive) under s.(1) is a conditional debt. 2)Graft is a word which can only be understood as meaning conditional. 3)Growth is not dependent upon the completion of a service or the payment of a debt. 4)The garnishment of the debt is a condition which arises naturally from a sale of a particular instrument. 5)Garnishment is not a branch of the common law of England which no longer applies. 6)The case law of garnishment is different from that of the garnishment or attachment of other debts. 7)The common law is based upon the principles of the assignability of note and is therefore not the complete answer to the issue at hand.","The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.",b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.

"The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The issues were whether the mother's failure to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refusal to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of its original judgment had been grounds for the application. HELD: 1) The evidence confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. The increased contact with his extended family in the Yukon, including his grandparents and his maternal grandparents, provided an increased social network that would be in the child's best interest. 2) There had been a material change in the circumstances at the time of the Original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary, was possible. The mother now opposed the application for the grant of sole custody to the father but stated that she hoped to move away from the current arrangement and would be more able to support the child in Whitehorse once she demonstrated her ability to comply with the shared parenting order. 3) The respondent was granted sole custody with the child to be shared with the mother. The evidence at trial was that the mother had advised the father that she wished to move to Whitehorse because it would be closer to her family. She also indicated that she would prefer to remain in Saskatoon. The custodial parent's reason for moving was not supported by the evidence as it was contrary to the views of both the mother and the child. 4) The child was too young to take into account his views regarding the matter. The decision of the Custody and Access Court in Gordon v. Goertz was based on the same principles as that of the others in the case: namely, that it was in the children's best interests for the parties to cooperate and allow the sharing parenting arrangement to continue.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.",e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible.

"Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders of the Board made in May 2004 and June 2004. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the company comply with the discovery and production of documents sought by the union. The applicant brought an application for judicial review of the May 2004 orders, arguing that the orders infringed the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Charter, the meaning of employer influence and the Charter rights of the parties who were designated by the Board asInterested Parties. In its amended notice of motion and detailed legal brief, the Board acknowledged that the Board had limited jurisdiction on a judicial review issue but asserted that it had the authority to compel the applicant to produce documents in contravention of previous rulings it had made. It also acknowledged that some of the documents sought might well enjoy solicitor-and-client privilege but added an additional requirement of its own: as well as any other documents that clarify the job functions and duties of the department managers. The interested parties submitted that, depending on how the hearings progress, they may be before the Court on similar issues, including the constitutional issue. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board ordered that the applicant produce the following documents: a copy of the first affidavit submitted by the applicant, copies of the applicant's application and submissions, and a written decision respecting any document discovery or production order that it might make pursuant to those orders. In this sense, the order was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record.  1) The Board conceded that two exceptions to the general rule apply. It has placed little reliance on the affidavit evidence. These portions would normally have been struck. 2) It is not in dispute that the board had the jurisdiction to order documents respecting communications to employees regarding trade unions or unionization as have emphasized as important the documents are clearly relevant to an issue before the Board. The Court will not intervene unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them into its order.  3) There is nothing in the decision to indicate that Wal- Mart Canada was relieved of compliance with any aspect of the subpoena or that it no longer required. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy or privilege respecting each document. 4) The application for","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.",9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.

"The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a 2 year 'non-competition' clause in his employment contract which prohibited him from soliciting or selling insurance on behalf of the defendant. Allstate sought to justify the termination by arguing that since compensation is calculated in part on the basis of the prior month's sales, it would be a failure by the employee to mitigate his damages. Awarding the plaintiff one month's arrears in the amount of salary, that this is because Allstate had made little effort to secure alternative employment for the sales agent. The plaintiff had joined Allstate as a sales agent in 1965 and continued in its employ for approximately 26 years. There was, however, no month for which he had not been compensated. The trial judge based his conclusions on a misunderstanding as to the true nature of the terms of the compensation as between himself and Allstate, and on the fact that the arbitration clause was not relevant in determining the appropriate period of notice. The decision to terminate the plaintiff was based on a reasonable course of conduct, which was not unreasonable. The fact that Allstate did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment, despite having received a pro-rated amount to November 5, 1991, when the termination of the plaintiff occurred, did not constitute a failure to mitigate the damages.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.",b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years.

"The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement with the children every second weekend. The husband objected that the wife was abusive of the children. The children were placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties was that the spouses were unable to communicate effectively with each other and the children did not have access to the other parent's information. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the child's best interest. Both parties have demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. This has resulted in the vitiation of virtually all direct communication between them. They do not meet face to face and do not talk on the phone. Their e-mails are curt at best. They use their children as messengers.","The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.",4_2010nssc85.txt,"The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50).

The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing would not result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction, and the Commission was treating the allegations as opposed to a procedural one.

"HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective assistance of his non-lawyer agent on the assault charge. The Office of the Queen's Bench President was awarded $2,500 to represent the appellant at the criminal trial on the grounds that there was a miscarriageof justice arising from the conduct of the trial. The officer’s lack of ability by itself was not a ground for determining that a miscarriage occurred. There was no unfairness to the appellant in the trial process as he made his decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. The decision to not testify was based on a strong recommendation of an experienced lawyer who was experienced and knowledgeable on the subject.

"The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff and his insurance company, ING, joined the action against the van's alleged owner and his co-accused under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The Court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to the accused and that he retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration. HELD: The Court awarded the all inclusive sum of $162,500. It remained for the court to decide whether that sum was to be paid by Allstate or by ING. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitates a number of credibility findings to be made. The only clear evidence on the identity of the accused was his admitted poor memory of the events that occurred within the general time frame. He admitted that he sold the vehicle to the woman who supplied his cocaine addiction, the fact that it was a grey cargo van with a shabby paint job and a rear mounted post light, which perhaps explained why he was unable to discern the license plate identification or even whether license plate was on the vehicle at all.

As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages.

At issue was whether the accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed. HELD: All evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to ss. 24(2). The Court held that the evidence obtained post-stop should not be excluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused’s right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure was denied. The Court found that the presence of a large amount of marijuana in the vehicle and in the small amount of a bag with some writing on it did not constitute reasonable grounds for a search. The strong odour of raw cannabis in the car could have been a hidden weapon. The evidence did not show any symptoms of impairment. The court noted that there had been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest.

"The applicant sought to have a solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a similar ruling involving a previous attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of solicitors. The solicitor had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation during the years prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. Much was made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigating of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. The onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifts to the party asserting the concern.",The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.

The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argues that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and that the accused was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position is that in these circumstances the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was lawful. The Court makes the following finding of the facts: [1] The Crown has proved beyond a reasonably doubt that The Police were engaged In the lawful Execution of Their ( lawful) Duty when they resisted the arrest of the accused who is over 6 feet in height and weighs more than 3 hundred pounds. OC spray was used but had no immediate affect on the accused. The accused was eventually handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car. The court takes issue with the defence's argument that the police should have questioned the accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication.,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.",b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

"The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. She alleged that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. She also appealed her conviction for strangling the victim, alleging that the appellant removed the victim's money from his wallet and choked the victim until he passed out. Appeal dismissed; the judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and the defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In assessing all the evidence, the judge recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility, but proof to criminal standard.","The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility.

Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence.

"The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02 of the Rules) because there was little evidence available to assess the degree of overlap in the evidence. The court reviewed the rules, case authorities and material before it and found that there was no evidence before the Court to determine whether consolidation was appropriate. The only thing that would allow a jury to determine the extent of commonality was whether the expert evidence to be called would have to be specific to each plaintiff.",",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants.

Central to the plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant was that the likely cause of the ongoing or recurring bleeding was the retained products of conception which the surgeon failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery.  1)The Court found that the surgical procedures performed on the plaintiff were realistic and reasonable in that they prevented the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysticomy. 2)The surgical procedures were straightforward and methodical. The only thing that could be expected of a surgical procedure was a detailed description of the procedures performed. 3)No medical evidence was given as a prima facie proof of the facts stated in Ares v. Venner, which held that if a doctor faced with a post-partum hemorrhage problem would, given that the most common cause of such a hemorrhage is retained products, then his diagnosis and treatment should be proper and reasonable.","A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.",b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis.

"The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). The accused's behaviour was misleading. The reasons for the dismissal of the charges were: 1)The accused was aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks and the circumstances permit; 2)The medical condition must make it either extremely difficult or extremely painful for the accused to obtain counsel once he indicates this wish; and 3)If an individual can't provide a sample by reason of a medical condition that is a reasonable excuse, the Court finds that the accused did not provide a reasonable one. The Court does not believe the accused's evidence on this point; even though the accused was diligent in attempting to reach counsel of his choice, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. No one was at the lawyer's number; and 4)Nothing registered on the intoxilyzer when he pressed the button to close the mouthpiece.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.",d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code.

"FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta, and a further order preservingand detaining all future production proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)The applicants failed to meet the first test of a prima facie case, the irreparable harm which could only be alleviated by requiring positive steps at the interlocutory stage, such an order was appropriate.  2)The court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as matter of fact. 3)If the applicants are required to pay full compensation, they must also demonstrate that they have a strong probability that grave damage will accrue to him in the future. 4)The Court must also consider the factors to be considered in the third test, which is whether the applicants have met the requirements set out in s.33 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the BLA) or if they have not. 5)The issue here is not whether the properties are declining in value, but whether this decline in value will occur at such a rapid rate as to rob the applicants of the fruits of potentially successful litigation, and therefor cause them irreparable damage. These are the test results of the BLA. The applicants must demonstrate that the Crown's willingness to wield its statutory powers under the O&G to ensure these environmental obligations are met. If these liens are substantially the same as those of all the claimants, then whatever prima-facie case they might otherwise have is weakened by this confusion.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.",b_1996canlii6726.txt,FIAT.

"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 (under S. 253)(1)(b)) and with failing to stop for police as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: 1) The accused's evidence was not credible as it tends to show that the accused's consumption of alcohol was consistent with both: (i) him not having BAC of over 80 mg% at the time of driving; and (ii) the BAC readings were determined by the alcohol expert. The accused was found not to have had a reasonable excuse for not stopping. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer had reasonable reasons for not acting as if the accused had been drinking alcohol all day. 2) The Court accepted the accused’s testimony that he had only consumed six beer and that his level of intoxication was in his view borderline and he required an ASD test to give him the grounds to make an Intoxilyzer demand. 3) The evidence was accepted. The only witness was a alcohol expert who gave opinion evidence on the drinking history of the accused. He was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the alleged alcohol consumption. The defence argued that the drinking was so low in the blood that it was a flight of the legs. The court found that the evidence of the alcoholics was at odds with the accused and accepted the evidence from the alcohol experts. 4) The court was satisfied that there was a reasonable reason for the accused not stopping, given that his blood-alcohol concentration was over 80mg% at that time. The drinking history was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed. The appellant’ s. 12 driving prohibition was not valid because of the drinking habits of the individuals he had met and because of what the accused claimed was a “last drink” defence. The Crown was not convinced that the alcoholic was not trying to elude or get away from the police. The evidence of Cobbledick and the accused was at issue. The issues were whether there was proof beyond areasonable doubt that Mr. Lehman was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. The issue was whether the accused offered a credible reason for not pulling over and driving.","Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face.

"The accused is charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The Crown cannot demonstrate constructive possession of the baggy in the wall in the minute following the transaction with Mr. Burke. HELD: The accused is found guilty on both counts. The court accepted the Crown's evidence that the transactions between the accused and the buyer were regular street level drug trafficking and that the encounters between the buyer and the accused were consistent with these drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in the crack cocaine as an explanation for the absence of the agent benedryl was not supported by the evidence as it was not made as part of the analysis of the transaction. Although the accused's description of what he saw in the street was obscured by the trees, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to purchase more crack cocaine was consistent with the behaviour of the accused during the purchase and during the sale of the drugs. The encounters were not directly with the buyer but with the accused making an effort to observe the transaction from a different vantage point.","The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.",2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.

"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 (1)(b) of the Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and he was transported to his home in Carlyle. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge was not prepared to set aside his decision. 2) On a review of the facts and circumstances and the law, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to the final determination. The standard of review was set forth in R. v. Helm (2011 SKQB 32), 368 Sask. R. 115 at paras. 19 and 20. 3) The accused was clearly informed of his right to consult counsel. He was also provided with a copy of the driver's licence, the vehicle registration and sobriety report. When the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned. The officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. There really was no similarity between the name 'Vaughn' and that of a relative who was known to him. It was most unlikely that some physical impediment caused the accused to make mistake. His speech was not slurred. 4) The respondent was not provided with the number for a telephone number to call free of charge.","The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.",5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

"The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert. The owner argued that the board's decision to refuse to grant an adjournment to prepare his appeal against the demolition order had been motivated by a history of non-compliance, the intolerable sub-standard living conditions endured by the tenants, and the absence of a pro-active board to responsibly manage the safety and security of the residents and visitors.

The Act does not expressly retroactive the way it was determined in the first place. The legislation is not intended to be a retrospective remedy. The fact that the defendant commenced proceedings under the 2009 act does not change the state of the law or the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture application from that perspective. The present case is analogous to the second instance. Under both regimes the terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in the same manner. The terms 'drugs and substances' and “unlawful activity” are defined in s.35.1. Both statutes contemplate an application to the Court for forfeiture of property that is alleged to be proceeds of unlawful activities. Both apply the same legal test and standard of proof.","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.",b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure.

"FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. In his last full year with Ipsco, being the 2000 taxation year, Mr. Pilat's gross annual income was the sum of $52,377. The mother of two children, who were heavily involved in the Kinsman Gymnastics Club, requested that the father pay child support retroactively. HELD: 1) The father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It was the father's decision to work only three months of the year and return to work that was a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  2) On all of the evidence the father had indicated that he intended to continue with his employment/ownership of the company and only work three months a year, he would be earning $21,000. 3) The mother had requested that costs as against be ordered against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  4) Costs were awarded to the mother in the amount of $750.  5) The accountant had submitted evidence respecting extracurricular activities and requested an order for sharing of the expenses in proportion to the parties' income. The accountant did not provide his Reply to the Notice to Disclose until August 11, 2003. 6) The respondent's income is $40,000 for the purpose of this application. $84 per month as and for the support of Stephanie.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.",3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.

"This appeal is from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LabourRB, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. The issue is whether s. 5.3 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S.; 1978, c. T-17, authorizes the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the words of s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power tomake interim orders: the existence of an application or complaint before the Board, and the presence of power in the Labour Board to makes final order in respect of the application. The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint' and 'final order or decision' in s. 4. The Board recognized it to be a jurisdictional question and treated it.

"In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property, a division of the property was held. At issue was whether the husband should resume livestock operation on the farm and whether it was a viable operation. HELD: 1)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $800 for February and $1,100 for March, April and May for a total of $4,100.  2)The respondent's claim for set-offs was allowed since he did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy a substantial amount of the farm assets were still to be dealt with. 3)The petitioner paid $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley sold privately. The respondent claimed this was in violation of the previous order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 4)Division of property was based on asset values at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. 5)When all of the assets were liquidated and it was determined what amount was actually available for division the wife was awarded 56% of the net proceeds to the respondent and 44% to the wife. 6)Each side was to bear their own costs.","This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506.

"The question in this case was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given.

"This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The respondent applied to the court for an order of prohibition. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the Court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial will be declared. 2)The respondent said that she had not read the record. She was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she put out her mindas she did in all instances where she ruled evidence in admissible. In these circumstances she was correct to dismiss the application for stay and to decline to recuse herself.","The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure.

The parties to this action signed handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: Contract between the parties: 1) The plaintiff is to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain the cows for a set price of $0.50 per day per cow. 2) The contract is to cover feeding and maintenance of about one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm. The plaintiff receives the feed and receives a bonus for each live calf that he gets to pasture. The parties did not contemplate payment of bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May. He agreed in the first agreement that a bonus was requested by the plaintiff but never paid. The Court has no way of accurately determining whether the figure should be $800 or $900 because the plaintiff did not have a copy of the final invoice given to him and he did not bring it to Court. 3) The parties cannot make an agreement as to the amount of the total cost of feed which has not been reached. This is an essential issue for the plaintiff to enforce his claim for unpaid fees. 4) The agreement was never enforceable except in the limited term that it was reached where the plaintiff refused to pay an essential sum for the purposes of enforcing the agreement.

"The Crown appeals the disposition of the cases. In addition to the large number of theft offences, the defendant used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. The defendant pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest under s. 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation on September 7, 1994. The Crown appeals this disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody and 18 months of open custody. 2)The defendant had made great change during the course of this period. He had been involved in a number of car thefts, one of which was a successful escape, and had made a conscious decision not to do so. 3)The sentence imposed on the defendant was four months open Custody.","The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft.

The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record.

FIAT. The accused sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to ss.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within areasonable time has been breached. Defence counsel took the position that at no point along the way did he waive delay and the delay of approximately 7 months which resulted from his desire to have a ruling made on the conflict of interest alleged is solely attributable to the Crown. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The accused has been on bail since shortly after his arrest. He agrees the delay has not resulted in a diminution of his ability to make full answer and defence. The prejudice he refers to in not being able to enter into long term contracts would have existed only for 21-1/2 months of the 25-month delay and would have been in any event for at least 15 months of that period of time. 2)The Court was satisfied that the actions of the accused which may have caused delay were normal and not the only reasonableness of the application. 3)There was no evidence as to the cause of the delay beyond the reasonable doubt that the accused's recollection of events leading up to the hearing was affected by the delay.,"FIAT.

Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay.

"This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA], in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The issue in Andrew (CA) is whether or not the trial judge considered Hrynewich Holdings in its entirety. An application of the principles set out in Andrew leads to the conclusion that the amount of the deficiency judgment should be $162,675.99. The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment against the appellants in that amount as at March 23, 2016. HELD: The appeal is allowed.  1) The portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land is 64.03% (64.03%) and is credited against $66,770.48 leaving a balance of $18,770 to be paid off. The purchase money portion is $536,186.72. 2) The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan and the respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.  3) The conclusion in Andrew is not binding. 4) The portions of the judgment that are owed to the mortgagee are reduced to $132,582.48 and are protected by s. 25 of The Land Contracts (Actions) Act. 5) The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to taking out the deficiency against the appellant in the amount amount of $31,160.23. 6) The Court will look at the extent to which s. 2 of the LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to both the purchase money debt and the non Purchase money portion. In the absence of such a provision, neutral approach involves allocation of the payment on a pro-rated basis to debt affected by section and nonpurchase-money debt. The proceeds should be distributed between the two portions on pro rata basis.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.",6_2017skca42.txt,"As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.

"This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would havesole custody of his daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of her mother since that time. The mother had been a stay-at-home mom and raised the daughter with the respondent. She indicated that she and the respondent had discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture that she would not need and allowing the applicant to move back into the matrimonial home in exchange for car payments. The timing of the application raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the home that prompted this application. HELD: 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents, however that only scratched the surface in terms of the relationship between the two. The Court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community.  2)The respondent indicated that if there was an order made that the child not be removed from the jurisdiction until trial, she will not move to Kelowna.  3)The parties were unable to exercise their custody rights after the hearing of this motion. 4)The court was unable to determine whether the affidavits should be permitted on the basis of the motion filed.","An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home.

The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence.

"The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered due to the unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras for services it had never been paid for. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contractual obligation and was not to be amended by the original invitation for tender. The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to do this it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being loaded and to reduce the build up of methane gas and the risk of fire within the banks. The equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender, and no objection appeared to have been taken with the equipment delivered to the site. Operational, Payment and Performance Issues: 1) The nature of the work, the need to keep the banks compacted and thereby reduce the fire risk in the banks, and the use of Track Dozers and Silos were to be considered. 2) Maintenance of the banks was not an issue in this action. There was no ambiguity in the wording of the purchase order as to the duties of the conveyer belt operators (the conveyor belt operators) and the equipment rental rates that would be charged for any extra work that the equipment was being supplied. 3) The use of railcars and trucking was considered. 4) The equipment was different from the one listed on the tender. 5) The amount of money advanced was not included in the bid price. 6) Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for expenses incurred due to equipment rentals or equipment rentals. 7) The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement was dismissed.","The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000.

The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for his daughter. The mother also alleged that the father had threatened her with removal and that she should seek help from Veith House to obtain a passport for her daughter. Father did not admit to threats to harm the child nor about his placing her in situations where there were peanuts present. The evidence did not support this allegation on the necessary balance of probabilities. HELD: 1)Joint custody does not necessarily mean joint custody is inappropriate. Both parties during the most recent incident had an opportunity to prevent escalation. The Father could have taken the jacket and left without getting into a tug-of-war over the jacket. The only evidence that the Father was from another country and still had family living in Egypt and Kuwait would not suggest a realistic likelihood of his doing so. 2)The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child.  3)The mother was to have regular access for two hours each weekday for one evening visit and two hours for one afternoon visit. Interim access was to be provided for two weeks at a time. 4)The Father was not to be under the influence of marijuana 12 hours before and while he had the child in his care.,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child.
