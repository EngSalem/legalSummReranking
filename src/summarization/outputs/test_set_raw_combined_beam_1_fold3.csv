d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two young complainants were living with their mother. He had been sentenced to 9 months imprisonment for the assault on the complainant and 2 years probation for the second count. The complainants had made a complaint to the police, who arrested the appellant after they left home. He was employed full-time and was not a user of drugs or alcohol. Shortly after the girls left home their mother moved in with them. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence which resulted in a substantial conviction for the appellant. The appellant denied assaulting the complainants, but sentenced him to 9 month imprisonment for each count of assault on B.J.R. and 2 months probation for another count. He appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony. After carefully reviewing the evidence, the court could not say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and the appeal was dismissed."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself and took the matter to trial by trial. He contended that he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he had evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal is all of the view that there is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts, the trial court found both the appellant and the estranged wife's testimony were accepted. The Trial judge found them both to not be credible witness and, in the same opinion, rejected the account, which was rejected. The court also found that the appellant was not credible witness in the circumstances."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(a) and to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The defendant, C&R Sterling Farm, moved to terminate the attachment order pursuant to Rules 49.01 and 49.02 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The defendants Sterling Farm alleged that the plaintiff interfered with the timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threatening behaviour and that the plaintiffs were to be stopped. Sterling Farm argued that the attachment ordered was unnecessary and that there were other grounds for termination including one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 44.(1). The plaintiff argued that there must be evidence of such conduct, not mere suspicion, in order to justify an attachment ordered. The defendants replied that they had not made any efforts to bring the claim to final determination and that they were making an application to change venue from the Halifax to the Windsor court. HELD: The attachment order was terminated. 1)The affidavit did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to justify the maintenance of the order. 2)The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under Rule 44(1) that would have warranted an attachment such as the one set out therein. The plaintiff did establish that the applicant had not established any of its grounds for the maintenance. 3)The plaintiffs were awarded costs."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The evidence at trial indicated that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 milligram and 110 milligres of alcohol. At 2:54 a.m., the accused provided a sample into an Alcotest 7410 GLC. The result was an 'F' indicating that the accused had a blood Alcohol level of at least 100 milligrain. At 3:54 am, the accused was examined by a qualified technician who made an approved screening device demand and at 1:54am, the officer noted an odour of liquor on the accused's breath, that her eyes were 'glossy', and her cheeks were 'flushed'. None of the other usual signs of impairment were present. The accused was transported back to the detachment, where she was turned over to a qualified technicians. At 1:55 a.M. a. (1) a.s. (2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.) the Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused’s blood alcohol levels. It indicated that both the accused and the technician had taken the samples directly into an approved instrument as defined in s. 254(1) of the Criminal Code. The technician testified that she saw the accused blowing into something that she described as an “intoxilyzer”. At the appointed time, the Crown gave a breath test demand with the usual warning and advice as to the right to counsel. At that time, both the technician and the accused gave a written statement that the sample was received directly into the approved instrument. At this point, the certificate could not be characterized as an approved device. The technicians testified that they saw the alleged approved technician write the figure 3 in over the top of the '3' in overtop of the “2” and they both had their own initials. At issue was whether it was a requirement of subparagraph 258(2)(g)(i) that the approved Instrument be identified by way of make and model; whether there was any evidence that the alleged authorized instrument was designated for such an application; whether the Crown should rely upon the model of an approved substance; whether it should rely on the Crown’ s standard of review; whether evidence was sufficiently advanced to advance the argument that the model did not advance"
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent is entitled to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider for one-half of the children's current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes.  2) The petitioner is entitled on an interim basis to pay the respondent $185 a month directly. There is nothing in the evidence before the court that rebuts that presumption on an ongoing basis. 3) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There was insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without affecting the ongoing operation of the company. The corporate cash flow statement showed very little cash available for distribution. 4) The father is entitled, on an initial basis, to have access all the time. 5) The parties' verbal agreement regarding the sharing of the income of the two children was not changed. The father shall continue to pay monthly child support payments of $185 for the period which pre-dates service of the application upon the father. 6) The court ordered the respondent to pay retroactive child support of $8,107 for 2006. The order should then be based on the father's 2004 income."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","The landlord appealed an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The landlord appealed, arguing that the order should have been made at a hearing in August 2009. Allowing the appeal and declaring that the lease had not been converted into a Month to Month, that the landlord had not withheld consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, and that the tenants had not succeeded in making this decision voluntarily. The court noted that there have been numerous cases where a landlord has unilaterally refused to consent to a tenancy, and there have even been cases where the tenant has actually expressed an intention to leave early. In this case, the tenant requested an earlier date, given that he had no way of knowing that his effort to convert the tenancy into a monthly to month would be thwarted. The tenant also requested that the date of the hearing be set as he believed it would be difficult for him to reach an agreement with the landlord on the conversion. The landlord objected, claiming that he was prevented from making this concession by the court. The Court allowed the appeal, declaring that that the original lease had been converted from a year-to-year lease to a month-to month tenancy because the landlord refused to give him the time to negotiate an early termination. The residential Tenancies Officer made no finding that the reasons for withholding consent were either arbitrary or unreasonably unreasonable."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary the child support order made in respect of his income, the parties' oldest child, who was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, and the fact that his daughter was no more a child of the marriage when the order was granted. HELD: 1) The husband's layoff was only temporary and his daughter continued to be a child in the meaning the Division Act. The fact that he was laid off from his employment and was only paying part of the time was grounds for a variation of the support order. 2) The child ceased to be child of The Marriage within the Meaning of the Act as the husband's s. 7(f) hockey expenses fell within the means of the legislation. The wife's s., 7(7) expenses were increased. 3) The parties' eldest child, whom they had separated in 1998, was paying child support for a period of time less his employer's support. The parties had agreed in 2002 that the child would be a 'child of the Marriage' if the wife followed through with her plan and actually commenced post-secondary education. The unreasonableness of the wife's position warrants an assessment of costs. 4) The wife was entitled to costs of the family law proceeding or step in family law proceedings."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The test on such an application requires there exist question of Law or question concerning the jurisdiction of the Board, doubt whether the Committee's decision is correct, or there is a question so broad as to warrant the attention of the Court. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescentence for the size. HELD: Leave to appeal the matter is denied. 1) The issue of the sale is a valid question of fact and in argument the applicant said the sale did not matter. Further on a perusal of the record the Assentor was fully aware the sale was portfolio sale, had contacted both the vendor and the purchaser, and provided particulars of the sales verification form as part of the evidence to the Board. 2) The test in such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment. The door may still be opened, but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. Raising issues of that sort only adds to what are often substantively burdensome applications, making it more difficult to knife through to the core and hence more difficult obtain leave."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences.

The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","The parties were married for four years and had purchased a home in Nova Scotia. The husband sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The wife, who was a self-represented litigant at trial, sought to introduce fresh evidence. The trial judge found no palpable or overriding error in the manner in which the judge calculated the value of the assets retained by the wife and the amount owed to the husband from the sale of the Chicago property.

2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The Court dismissed both applications for an order varying the child support order granted by the Justice R.D. Maher by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent.

The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Marketing Council applied to strike two affidavits filed by the applicant in connection with a dispute between the parties regarding the applicant's application for a declaration of rights and the suspension of their license.

c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff tender company was the successful bidder. The defendant commenced work under the contract and continued working until the contract was terminated by the defendant in March 1986. The plaintiff sued for damages including the revenue lost from plant down time, the cost of renting substitute equipment, the increase in the cost in contracting for substituting services and the payment of overpayments made to the plaintiff. The defendants agreed to provide the plaintiff with fixed rates and fair and reasonable compensation. The court dismissed the plaintiff's damages claim.

The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They claim that he has brought an application that effectively challenges the validity of the Will he is presently an executorof and he is refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Will. HELD: The respondent is removed as an executrator.  1) The Court has jurisdiction to remove an executorian of an estate both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. 2) The court found that this is a case in which it should exercise its jurisdiction to removed the respondent from acting as executorian. 3) The respondent will not co-ordinate in proper administration of the Estate. The Court held that the only person who could be considered a party to the proceedings was a person who was neither named beneficiary under the Will nor a potential beneficiary in the event of an intestacy. The person who had been identified as a co- administerant in the original Will contained in v. 1(d) of the will and who was not entitled to represent the applicants on the applications.
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, the plaintiff applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. Because the Sheriff holds funds seized under the enforcement proceedings following the entering of the default judgement, Sollows' counsel undertakes to request the Sheriff to continue to hold those funds pending further order of the Court. Counsel for the plaintiff seeks costs in any event of the cause on the basis that the default verdict was set aside ex debito justitiae. The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only 7 days past the date Sollow's was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded soon after default judgment was entered, this delay in defending the actions might constitute sufficient reason to deny Key its day in court."

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana after a large quantity of marijuana was seized from their possession. At trial, the voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of the marijuana. The trial judge found that the police had only a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched, which was not reasonable. He also held that there was no breach of their s. 8 Charter rights. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The appeal was allowed and a new Trial ordered."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence argued that the notice of possession had been sent to the prosecutor in May 2003, but the judge had failed to prove that the date of the offence as alleged in the Information. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offense, that the trial judge erred in failing to grant a directed conviction. The Crown appealed, arguing that the judge er erred by granting a motion based on the discrepancy between the date the offences alleged in Information and the evidence presented at trial because the alleged ininformation was not an essential element of the offences. Appeal allowed; the trial court found the errors of law were reversible."

Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the 5 year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years; the husband had worked in the oil industry for 10 years, until he terminated his employment in 1989.

2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The defendant had issued a consent order in 1999 which authorized the appointment of a Band councillor as the proper representative for the First Nation. In 2002 the councillor filed an application seeking to have the action dismissed for wantof prosecution based on the testimony of the officer who had direct involvement in the settlement negotiations. In 2004 the officer concerned filed a motion seeking to appoint the respondent as the person to examine for wanton prosecution. Counsel for the respondent subsequently filed a second application seeking the return of $40,000 paid by the plaintiff to McDiarmid. The respondent subsequently brought an application for an order returning the $40k paid by Ochapowace to Mcdiarmid and retaining by the latter the officer of the appellant corporation who had been the primary representative for McDiamp; in 2009 the officer filed an affidavit claiming to be the person sufficiently knowledgeable about the McDiamid dealings and appropriately representative of the First Nations to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. Application for an Order returning the money was not granted as the matter had now proceeded to trial. The affidavit filed by Bellanger does not satisfy the Court that the defendant will suffer serious prejudice. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made by OChapowac to McDarmid are live issues raised by the pleadings. However, the context in which the delay in pursuing the action was found to have been inexcusable, nevertheless, the prejudice suffered by the defendant does not reach the level of serious prejudice having regard to the factors listed in the ICC case. It is in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the inordinate and inexcusible delay."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with impaired care or control contrary to section 253(b) and section 253 of the Code. The accused was found guilty of driving over.08 contrary TO s. 254(3)(b) of The Criminal Code. HELD: The accused is guilty of both counts. 1) The accused's condition was potentially serious and the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. 2) The Court reviewed the principles it had established in R. v. Leedahl and reviewed Schnell's dominant or controlling purpose during the critical overlap period and found that the Court was entitled to remedy the exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Having found that there is no remedy of exclusion in the meantime, the Court ordered the Certificate to be removed."

At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted and defaulted. The proposal was deemed to be annulled.

The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to the insurer. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the Act provides that an annuitant's interest in any retirement savings plans be assigned or attached by way of a security Interest to a Group Plan, pursuant to s. 146(3) or s.168 of the Income Tax Act. 2)The provisions of s.146(2) and s.147(3)(c) of The Income Tax act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by wayof a loan on the Group plan contravenes s.150(2); s.155(2), s.186(2). The provisions of the Plan Contract and s.(3) are of no assistance in light of the provisions of ss.146 and s(13). 3)The applicant had not retired and no pension refund existed. Since she had notretarded and no a pension refund exists, there appears to be a nomonetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by her. 4)The legal effect of the loan agreement is similar to the security arrangements discussed in McMahon v. Canadian Permanent Trust Company. 5)Nothing in the Plan contract or the Income tax Act prohibits Crown Life in setting off the applicant's indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it to her. Since Ms.Cadden has notretired and no Pension refund exists there appears only a nomontetary sum currently to setoff, unless such a proper application has been taken by the applicant and a proper requested request for transfer has taken place. 5)""The provisions in s.7.02 of the plan contract contravene s.144(2(c) and the IncomeTax Act.

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the relocation are whether it is in the best interests of the baby to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton with the petitioner; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child to have with the applicant. HELD: 1) The respondent is the primary caregiver and psychological parent of the children. The child has had a stable arrangement in Saskatoon which provides significant access to his parents. The issue on the respondent is whether it would be in the children's best interests to relocate with the baby from Saskatoons to Edmonton where the petitioner will have access to her parents; and 2) What is an acceptable access schedule is for the baby with the current access schedule. The evidence on the best interest of the respondent and the child in Edmonton is that the child will lose the bond he now has with the mother. The applicant's plans for the future of the infant child in Alberta are vague and her move will undermine the co-parenting arrangement reflected in the minutes of settlement. The Court reviewed the best practices of an existing parenting arrangement and found that the respondent would be better able to support the child if the child moved to Edmonton, but the respondent's reasons for moving were vague and he would lose contact with his extended family in Edmonton. It was not in the respondent’s best interests that the baby relocate to Edmonton so that he would be able to have access with the infant. The court reviewed the respondent in Gordon v. Goertz and found it was in the petitioner’ s best interests for the respondent to relocate to Alberta with the children so that the relocation would not adversely affect the child’S relationship with his parent. The best interests test has been characterized as indeterminate and more useful as a legal aspiration than a practical analysis. The trial judge’d misapprehension of the existing parenting arrangements had significant consequences. The appellant would lose the ability to support his child in the long run. The administration of child care and the custody arrangement in Alberta was at issue. The access schedule would harm the respondent because the child would lose his access with his current parent. In Gordon v., the court found that child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with the best wishes of the Child and that the appropriate access pattern is for Harley to be with"

The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.",The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister three children of and L. The Minister sought an Order under s. 37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing the children to the mother. The Department had been very much involved. The mother had separated from the father and had been drinking. She had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had spent years trying to protect the children. She was not able to manage the household duties and was sometimes late getting help. HELD: An order was reserved. The children were to be permanently committed to the Father. An order for permanent committal was ordered.
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The evidence from the child protection worker was that the mother was mentally ill and abusive to the children and that the father should be made aware that she was unavailable to the parties for assistance in dealing with the problems. The evidence regarding the mother's failure to follow through with her demands for child support was dismissed. The tapes were found to be of significant importance to the father, but their production of the videotape evidence was far too little and the evidence did not show that the parents truly understood the child's violent nature and dysfunctional relationships with the children. The videotape recordings were inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified."

The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.

In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner, through his involvement in the two real estate partnership, found that he had ceased to meet his partnership obligations generally as they became due. He claimed business losses of $315,308, and saved a total of $108,625.65 in personal tax liability. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed.

No adequate explanation was offered by the respondent for his failure to pay his partnership obligation.  2)The respondent had committed an act of bankruptcy within six month prior to his filing of this petition. The Petitioners had repeatedly demanded that he pay the debt. No proper explanation was provided by the petitioner for his failed to pay.  3)The evidence established that the respondent was very clearly indebted to them in the amount claimed. The respondent had failed to make proper business losses and had simply ignored or failed to indemnify his partners in respect of the mortgage debts. 4)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court refusing to issue a receiving order."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not exceeded the threshold for determining whether a final order of the court had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order. The Court also held that the trial judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the 2008 Variation order and the 2011 variation order. In fact, the court found in both cases that the court exceeded the thresholds for determining the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In the case of the variation order, the respondent was required to pay retroactive child support in the amount of $1,500 per month for a period of 36 months. The defendant failed to do so."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant sought to have the trial judge, who had previously been the respondent, hear an acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column 5. The court's experience in carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing was no basis to interfere with the decision. The trial judge focused on the predominant issue and in our view he addressed it as required by law.

2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car contrary to ss. 430(4) of the Code. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court agreed with this procedure and the trial proceeded on information 24614281 where the Crown and the defence evidence were applied over to and became the evidence on information 24814281.  1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad, there is no doubt that the actions of the accused and the manner in which they were attacked were aggressive. The actions of both accused were aggressive and the plaintiff took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family. 2) The Court found that the two accuseds were justified in using force to defend themselves or any one under protection from assault if he used no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it.  3) The actions taken by the two men were aggressive, the actions were calculated to force the complainant to take necessary and lawfully lawful action. The injuries would have been far more severe if this had actually happened. However, even if it did occur, the furious struggle between the complainant and the defendant, aided by the plaintiff, was threatening behaviour and the accused thought he was going to apologize. The defence did not cross-examine on this point. 4) The evidence on the second count was admitted. The main witness testified that she was in the bar when the two of them got into a fistfight. She said the two were holding hands and the punches were heard over and over again. The Crown and defence witnesses were all called over to the information 24415281 where they were allowed to continue their testimony. 5) The court found that neither the plaintiff's s. 37(f)Criminal Code s. 36(f)(i) or s. 77(g) assault was justified. The action of the two brothers was justified in being used as the main weapon. The defendant was not there to apologize for the assault."
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appeals the conviction on the basis that it is unreasonable, is based on a misapplication of the burden of proof and the judge's reasons are so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal is dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence."

At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","The appellant and his wife appealed a corollary relief judgment, dividing matrimonial assets and ordering support for the children of the marriage, with respect to their effective commencement date. The husband argued that he should have included in the assets money manager account the money had already been divided equally by the parties. The trial judge observed in his decision that the furniture had already be divided equally. The appellant sought an earlier effective date so he could obtain income tax deductions for monies he paid prior to March 1, 1991 covering largely expenses relating to the matrimonial home in which the wife was living with the children. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not err in not finding that the spent money should be included in this division."
3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appealed the decision of Matheson J. confirming the second decision of that Board appointed by Minister of justice under The SRC Code which held that the appellants continued to discrimination against disabled member of the general by failing, failing to, provide access or accessible services, and ordered that the applicant construct or upgrade washrooms that meet the accessible requirements of National Building code of Canada1995. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with cost. Mathesons J. did not err in failing to find that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the appeal had not complied with the original order. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant complied with it with the result that the ceased to contravene the Code. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was found guilty of second degree murder and was sentenced to death. The three passengers on the car who were killed were all acquitted on the basis of the first degree murder charge. The chambers judge dismissed the defendant's application for summary judgment on the grounds that the first part of the test was not open to appeal and the affidavit was not admitted and relied upon. The Chambers judge dismissed both the defence and the application for dismissal. The second part of that test was whether the defendant had met the burden of showing that there was a genuine issue of fact for trial. The issues on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in the application of the Test for Summary Judgment and whether the judge properly considered and accepted the evidence attached to the affidavit. Allowing the summary judgment application, that there is a genuine issues of fact and that the test is well established and has been proven in numerous cases. The test is whether the applicant met the onus placed upon him in the second part to prove that his claim was not supported by the evidence presented through other affidavits and the evidence of the trier of fact.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month in child support and ordered to have his child in the interim care of his mother. The petitioner counter-petitioned, claiming division of property, joint custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time for the respondent and costs. The applicant also submitted that the respondent had verbally abused and pestered her for several days. The parties had reconciled but then resorted to communicating exclusively via text messages. The evidence showed that the petitioner was concerned that the parties were holding the child from her and that the child had been kept from her. She decided to end the relationship. The interim arrangement was ordered that the two parties have one child, Z. The child would be in the custody of the petitioner and the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have the child in interim care with her son to come pick up the parties from their house. The father was to pay child support for the petitioner until trial could be held. The children would be able to spend some time with the father. The parents were to have a shared parenting time with Z. After the pre-trial conference was held, the petitioner separated from the respondent who had been paying child support. The two parties then resorted by text message to the applicant. The essence of the communication was to try and get the child out of the relationship and to have him in the permanent care of the mother so that he could spend some quality time with his new family. The message was that the parents would be better served by having the child live with the petitioner rather than with the husband. The husband was to provide the child with a home and the child was to bring the child to the parties' house so that they could spend quality time together. The wife was to receive the child's birthday and the parties had discussed the child having a party. The son had not seen his mother for three months and had not been seen by his father for three weeks. The relationship had lasted less than a year. The issues between the parties was complex and the father was prone to anger and was prone in some cases to calling the mother to complain. The court had no authority to direct the parties to an expedited pre- trial conference. The family had been locked out for several years and had been trying to reconcile. The last two years have been difficult for the parties because of the numerous moves, changes in circumstances, changes to the child and the absence of a child. The current interim"

After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.

The defendant did not receive a copy of it until shortly before the expiry of the period of review. 2)The defendant did everything he could to ensure that the contract was executed. The delivery of a copy was not an express term of the contracts and the defendant did nothing but use the mail in the ordinary course to forward the fully executed document to the plaintiff. 3)The contract was not binding. The court accepted the plaintiff's argument that the defendant had not received a copy. The evidence from the plaintiff was that the defendants had discussed the possibility of a breach of the contracted. 4)The court accepted that the plaintiff took calculated risk and sold the canary seed. The contract was valid. The defendants both considered that the use of the word 'call' in the contract could not be considered an express form of the agreement. The letter was not a copy as the defendant never received a complete copy of each contract. 5)The plaintiffs were awarded the balance of production by the defendant pursuant to the contract.

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death following a serious motor vehicle accident. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay and offered the use of their legal counsel to defend him. The plaintiff opposed the offer and sought to have the matter dealt with by trial judge.

HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The issue of damages was whether the defendant had a pecuniary interest in imposing sanctions upon the plaintiff, pursuant to s.32 of the Charter. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)The restriction placed on the plaintiff was not in her personal capacity. She was free to discuss municipal issues with the ratepayers in his division and within the municipality and with the media and others. 2)She acted with a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. 3)She did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. 4)Even if the defendant's decision did infringe the plaintiff's right to expression to some extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the sections of The Rural Municipals Act, 1989, or the Rural municipalityality Act relied upon in the plaintiff’s legal opinion, the defendant was not acting in goodfaith in providing counsel to the plaintiff."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","The accused was charged with failing to swear the Information to Obtain a search warrant.

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains a number of specific facts, some of which have no reasonable prospects of success, and contains several provisions that the defendant could have used to create a reasonable claim or defence. The pleading or other document discloses the defendant’s only possible claim for workers compensation benefits and damages. The defendant also states that the Claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. HELD: The claim is struck. SaskTel is awarded its costs. On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. The pleadings carefully reviewed the pleadings. The conclusion was that the plaintiff’d claims against Sasktel had no reasonable chance of success and should be struck."

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude this evidence. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code and whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before the court. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1) The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body at the time of the ASD demand. 2) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonable belief of alcohol that the threshold is far lower than the required belief to make such a demand. The threshold is now far lower. The officer's objective in making the demand was to formulate a reasonable conclusion on the basis of the evidence raised by the last two grounds.  3) There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused."

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service.

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent had not exceeded the effective date and that the petitioner’s obligation to pay retroactive support of $4,322 had not been struck. The respondent’d requested the change in circumstances in relation to the custody and care of the two children and alleged agreement struck in or about July 2003. The petitioner had not engaged in blameworthy conduct. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum were not so significant that the applicant would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. The Court found that the annual increases of $2,322 were not enough to warrant a change in circumstance. The applicant’ll be required to pay $380 per month as retroactive maintenance."

e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. Following a jury conviction, the applicant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. The latter were both upheld on appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) The trial court was not persuaded that the appellant's arguments were misplaced. When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that, if the appellant could have outrun the Constable, this would suggest that the Constable who had been driving the Tempo had been the more experienced officer and therefore less likely to be called to testify. The appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the trial judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was the driver of the white Tempo. The jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of the Crown's credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court noted that this was not a case where the convictions turned exclusively on eye witness evidence. The appeal court was unable to conclude that either of the appellant’s convictions were unreasonable or were in excess of the total sentence imposed."

The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13. The defendant earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the reduced assessment in March 1997 but in September 1997 the utility and review board issued a $420k.13 property tax refund cheque to the plaintiff. The corporate trustee appealed the assessment and sought interest on the amount overpaid. The court found an obligation to refund excess taxes in 1994 but awarded a prejudgment interest back to 1988 for the date the overpaid health taxes were first remitted. The tax payers had no right to a full refund of overpaid taxes until the disposition of any appeal of the assessment. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75%) was the appropriate rate on the principal amount of $410,177 fro the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March/97 and the payment of the property tax refunds in September and October/98.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty.

The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the counts and sentenced him to three years imprisonment. He pled guilty to one count of theft. The other count was conspiracy. HELD: The accused was sentenced to three year imprisonment and a credit of four years and nine months for the time spent in custody. The global sentence was reduced to eight years and six months. The discretion to grant the credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. The accused had an incredible criminal record. It is lengthy and continuous, commencing in 1979 and running to the present. There are 121 convictions, 39 being for property offences, 50 being for fraud and several for non-compliance with court orders. The criminal record confirms the deplorable state of his attitude. For that, he appears to have supported himself through crime. The principles of sentencing remain and did have the assistance of the two cases cited above. Denunciation and deterrence are important but one must not abandon all hope, although it may be minimal. In any event, one of the objectives of sentencing, as stated in the Criminal code, is rehabilitation. Hearsay: The sentencing guideline was fit and appropriate. The two counts were stayed. The credit should be one for one, put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. The quantum of credit was reduced due to the time served on custody."
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge interpreting s. 89(1) of the Indian Act and holding that the respondent had been negligent in failing to give notice of his assignment. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The trial judge held that s.89(1)(a) of The Indian Act was applicable and set aside the provisions which prohibited an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements with the operation of commercial business. The appeal allowed on the basis that the trial Judge misinterpreted s.87(1), which applied to prevent an Indian in business from pledging his personal assets on the reserve on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. The Court also held that the provisions of s.2 of the Act, which provides for an interpleader proceeding, did not supersede the provisions in the Indian act. The Chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s.(89)(1). The Act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an Indian than a general assignment. When an Indian is in business he holds and deals with his business property in the commercial mainstream on terms that are no different to those applicable only those applicable in the States. The Act provides for the protection afforded by s.(87, 89(2) of S.89) of s(1)) of the act."

The court awards costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings 2 years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire. The fact that the defendant filed an affidavit supporting the plaintiff showing the operation of his business in the second location did not, in itself, support disclosure of the documents. The defendant argued the documents were relevant to the action. The plaintiffs motion was granted costs in the amounts of $250 to the defendants and disbursements from the court. Motion for Production of relevant documents dismissed; the commonality in a two-year-and-a-half-year span does not justify disclosure. The occurrence of a second, separate building in separate premises two years apart did not justify the disclosure of these documents. A fire in the defendant building 2 years ago did not establish relevance to the issues of negligence raised in the pleadings."
e_2004skca31.txt,"This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the Court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A. who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift or to maintain the schedule existing prior to its decision under appeal. The father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The parties were to be governed by the order of Wright J. unless otherwise agreed and until further order. The parties are to be bound by the Order of WrightJ. unless ordered otherwise agreed to and until a further order; they are to in week no. 1. Given all the circumstances of this case, it appears that Wright J was of the view that the judgment roll 'vacates' the order made in February 25. The effect of the order declining to lift is that it parallels that that ofGerwing J., who decided in February 2005, prior pre-final reasons being submitted, not not to lifted the stay and to maintain pre-judgment schedule existing before the decision under review. As it turns out, final reasons were filed that day, but because notice of appeal in relation to those reasons was filed almost immediately, Wright J.''s order came into effect and has been in effect for the past two weeks. Accordingly, the parties are now in week yes. Under the order in Wright J., $600 maintenance is payable by the father on the first of each month. The judgment roll “vacate” the order issued in February. The immediate question is the effect of this order on the obligation to pay maintenance. The first issue that arises in considering this question is whether it is appropriate for me to interpret the effect that the order declined to lift. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's brief filed a separate brief arguing the staying the Execution of Kleebuc J’s judgment does not revive that prior maintenance ordered and that Court of appeal chambers judge did not have authority tomake such an ordered. Accordingly the parties were in week No. 1 of the Court hearing the appeal."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The accused had been acquitted of the first count of murder following a preliminary inquiry. The court gave them 9 years of pre-trial custody with a credit on a 2 for 1 basis for time spent on pre- trial custody. The judge gave them credit for time in custody on the basis of for which he would amount to 33 months credit. The reason for the credit was that the accused had not accepted responsibility for the offence and had difficulty processing anger emotions. The defendant had difficulty in processing anger and it was apparent that his psychological well-being was at risk because of the presence of the gun. The sentencing guidelines for the two counts were set out in R. v. Downes (2006). A sentence of 9 years for remand time and a credit of months for time spend on pre pre-rial release would be appropriate. The offences were particularly serious given the nature of the offence, the presence and use of handguns and the fact that the defendant had a high school education and an interest in upgrading his education. The case demonstrated that there was so much more that occurred in the wee hours of that night than was previously known. The community was loathe to assist the police in their investigation. The sentence imposed was one of years, months incarceration."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.",A warrant was issued for the search of a vehicle after it overturned and a male was found to be inebriated. Blood was drawn from the vehicle and a Certificate of Analysis was issued to the driver. The officer testified that he thought the driver of the vehicle had been driving when the accident occurred and that he observed the male in the rear seat of the car when it crashed. The Certificate of Analyst was not issued to that officer. The affidavit material was not cited as supporting the warrant. The evidence gathered as a result of the information to Obtain constituted a warrantless search and the officer failed to communicate the basic information required of an accused to consent to the taking of blood samples. The warrant was invalid and the evidence found to have been reasonably reasonably foreseeable did not constitute reasonable grounds for the accused's s. 8 rights. The Court held that the officer had not provided sufficient detail in the Information to Obtains so as to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue. The accused's section 8 rights were breached. The Crown and the accused agreed that the accused should testify on voir dire for the purpose of the Court making determination of the validity of the warrant and the admissibility of the evidence. The defence argued that the Certificate of Analytics and the report of an analyst were not sufficient grounds to warrant an inquiry. The court held that it was not necessary to justify the warrant in the circumstances. The certificate of analyst was not a sufficient ground for belief as it did not include the source of his belief that the driver was not wearing a seat belt. The analyst's report could not be relied upon as it was found that the only person who could have been moved in the vehicle was the male. The respondent was granted leave to cross-examine on the information obtained in the information pursuant to the warrant as it constituted a breach of the accused’s s.8 rights.
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, pursuant to s. 44 of the FAM Act.

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month).","FIAT.

Until she withdraws from the workplace, the mother will have sole custody. 2)The father's obligation shall commence on the first day of the month following the time that the mother makes herself available for full-time parenting of the boy by withdrawing from the workforce.

5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military after a sexual assault conviction. The military had then re-assessed her release on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of their trade or employment. The Minister of Defence later reversed the decision and the plaintiff sued the federal government seeking a pension. She successfully applied for a stay of the proceedings restraining the denial of her pension. The Crown appealed the decision. The plaintiff argued that the stay should have placed an obligation on the plaintiff to apply for a pension and then to demonstrate that pension was payable. The judge dismissed the plaintiff's application. She was not able to pursue the administrative process as she had never made an application for a benefit. The limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired and the action was allowed to proceed. The defendant argued that s. 111 of the Pension Act or s. of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she is now entitled to a pension from the Crown. HELD: The stay was lifted and the Plaintiff was allowed in the action. She had not made an unsuccessful application for pension and, in the circumstances, there was no onus on her to pursue this application. The court found that s.(1) of the Liability & Proceedings Act or the Crown liability and proceedings Act could be read to amount to the statement of entitlement. The reverse onus was placed on the appellant. The claim was not dismissed. The delay in bringing the action for the benefit of the plaintiff was deemed premature. The administration of justice was served by virtue of the stay."

In 1989 the vessel was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990 an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel had been registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded in January 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. The Minister appealed the decision of the Board which held that the yacht was not 'within the Province'. Dismissing the appeal, that in the case of aircraft operations there must be a substantial, at least more than nominal presence in order to attract taxation, and the 'aircraft and parts' category did not apply.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The respondent Board issued an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, quashing the respondent Board's decision to deny the applicant's application for dependent benefits. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that the respondent should apply for benefits. At the Board's hearing, the applicant was found not to be found dead within the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act and the application for benefits was denied. The respondent Board applied the test in support of the application and found that it was not found dead. The issues were whether the Board acted outside its jurisdiction in denying benefits based upon the reasons for the delay; whether the respondent board acted outside of its jurisdiction when it determined that the applicant died at work; whether there was any evidence of the suddenness of the symptoms leading up to the death and whether the applicant had any potential entitlement to benefits pursuant to s. 30 of the Act; whether it was appropriate to grant benefits to the applicant in the event of a cause beyond its jurisdiction; whether s. 45 should be allowed in favour of the applicant; whether S. 30 should be permitted in the circumstances; whether certain provisions of the legislation had been violated; whether any of the provisions of s.30 should be made part of the Board’s remit to review the claim. HELD: The application for dependants’ benefits was dismissed. The court found that s.45 should not be allowed because it did not apply to the respondent. The privative clause found in s.22 did not shield the Board from its decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide matters but the legislation did not “intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board.” Section 45 was not applicable in the context of the respondent’ s.7 Charter case."

7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the divorce and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program. The parties were separated for in excess of 1 year. The child was to be the primary child in the program. There was no reason for the Court to make any further changes. The matter would proceed to trial. The Court reviewed the threshold test for determining whether an interim order should be varied. It was clear from the outset that the parties were in some disagreement and that there was some concern that the child's access to the program was at risk. Therefore, the Court ordered the children to be in theMontessori school so that he could get to his hockey practices and games and continue to develop his relationship with the child. The new child was born one year after the original order was made and was doing well in the preschool program. As the petitioner was in a new relationship and the child was not yet fully potty trained, further time was in the child’s best interests."

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced the divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the father. The father sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousals. The mother argued that the Separations Agreement was a good agreement and that it should be varied to reflect the true financial circumstances of the parties. The parties agreed to joint custody of the child and to provide the mother with the means to support her family in the area. The husband argued that he expected the agreement to be varied because he believed the agreement would favour the mother and that mobility would become an issue at some point. The evidence showed that the parties had first arrived at an amount of child support which when combined would keep the mother in the jurisdiction. The agreement clearly favoured the mother. The respondent gave up all his interest in the division of matrimonial property (except for his vehicle) in order to keep his child in the home. He agreed to term of spousol support that exceeded what he was prepared to pay. The petitioner failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause which prevented her from keeping her and her child in their home. The court ordered an increase in access."

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the transcript she had prepared for her appeal. At the time of her appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal in Provincial Court, and had filed notice of Appeal in appeal court Chambers. In that notice of appeals, the trial judge found that the appellant committed the act of public mischief under s. 140 of the Code when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter into an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible. In addition, the respondents had not ordered the production of any of the 1,700 pages of transcript required to be included in the appeal books. The appellant had not filed a certified transcript. She claimed that if she did not file the transcripts, the applicants could apply to dismiss the appeal on an ex parte basis for dismissal. The respondents' motions to dismiss both appeals were granted. The Court dismissed the appellant's motion to consolidate both appeals and to have the respondents pay the costs of certification of the transcript. The appellants' motions were granted in part. The court dismissed the respondent's motion for a further adjournment in connection with her Criminal Appeal. It held that the appellants had failed to comply with Rule 90.40(2) of the Rules and that it was unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts. The respondent's motions to consolidate and to compel the respondents into paying for the certification of the transcripts were granted on an Ex parte application.

Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court found that the evidence sufficiently credible to prove the elements of the offence beyond areasonable doubt with credible evidence. The evidence did not support the accused's allegations of mental or physical impairment. The accused's failure to signal lane changes was a reliable indicator of impairment. Further, the Court found no medical condition or symptoms of impairment with respect to the impairment of the driving ability. The Crown purported to rely on the results of standardized field sobriety tests. The court found that based on the same principles as in R. v. Landes (1997), the Crown is to charge only on results of results of 100 milligrams of alcohol or drugs. The defence argued that the accused did not show any symptoms of intoxication. The only symptoms were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. The officer noted that the vehicle was wandering somewhat within its lane and did not stray into the other lane. The appeal court also found that although the accused had failed two sobrialy tests, the other two were inconclusive and there was no onus on the accused."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a time extension to the trial date on the basis that the trial was already beginning before the outside disposition date provided in the Act. The Minister had refused to extend the time period for the trial, arguing that it was in the best interests of the child to have the matter continue beyond the overall deadline. The mother also argued that it would be in the child's best interests to have an extension of the overall time limit so that the agency could reapprehend in order to offer the needed protection and pursue the primary and ultimate goal of reunification. The Court dismissed the motion. It held that, if the legislature intended to make an order after a trial that operates beyond the statutory time deadline, they had not intended it to be done. The extension of that time period could not be done simply because of the protection concerns, which would require intervention by the agency and any attempt after the trial to make a permanent care order would not be possible."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The victim of a car robbery was found in the car with the gun and stolen property, in the company of three young men who had been in the vehicle with the victim. The police observed the car taking the exit from the highway from Sackville and they observed it leaving the scene of the robbery. The car was stopped at high risk take down and their identities were determined. The gun was found under the back seat of the car. The young men in the Car testified that they had been picked up at some building somewhere in Fairview and that they were in the driver's seat when the police stopped the car; the young men testified that their description of the robbers was similar to that of the person in the picture in the back of the Car. HELD: The evidence of the victim’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the person who was in the driving was not involved in the robbery; the gun description was consistent with the description of K.M. who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and that the other young men were the same people. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the accused was just wrong. The evidence established that the first accused was not in the courtroom with the other two young men but was in a car with him when the robbery was alleged to have taken place and that he was in it with the two young people (K.M.) when it was stopped. The second accused was in another vehicle and the police observed it taking the ramp from the Highway from Sackvillage to the exit point from the city from Sackvila. The Crown had indicated that the second accused had been pick up in a building somewhere else. The court was able to conclude that the third accused had picked up the gun in the second vehicle and that that was the person he was standing in front of and that both of the accused were the people he described. The Court was also able to infer that the last accused, who had plead guilty, was not the person that was in that car."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The Court granted the appeal and upheld the sentence imposed. The Court held that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. The Crown appealed the sentence. The Appeal Court found that the sentence was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, there was an error of law by the lower court, or there was miscarriage of justice. The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. The court stated that it was entirely legal for the defendant to acquire his firewood from Crown land and sell it to an undercover officer. The defendant had assured the officer that he would not be proceeding with the 100 cords as he was harvesting wood from Crown lands. The conservation officer testified that he had seen the defendant cutting wood from private lands and he suspected the wood was from Crown property. The appeal court also held that, having been found not guilty on count 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products and count 2 of unlawfully trafficking, it was illogical and inconsistent for the trial judge to have convicted him of the offence of illegally trafficking. The defence argued that the defendant sold the wood from his private lands to an officer for his personal heating use and that he did not exercise due diligence in ensuring the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the wood came from Crown wood. The accused argued that it should be taken as an admission, not an admission that he obtained his wood from crown land and that the wood comprising the 150 truckloads and 58 truckloads sold in 2008 and 2009 or the three cords sold to Clarke were from Crown Lands. The appellant argued that given the Crown’s record of not exceeding $1 million in forest products sales and that Clarke had testified that it would be illogical for the Court to not allow the appeal where it could be shown that the verdict is unreasonable or could be supported, there were errors of law or there were miscarriage ofjustice. Thus, the appellant court was estopped from disputing the factual or legal issues made in respect of these acquittals."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that the parties could appeal an award to the court on a question of law, on a balance of probabilities, and on a very narrow issue. The terms of the contracts, which each provided an implied condition that the Parties could appeal the arbitrators' decision on a questions of law basis, were set out in the terms of each contract. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements, particularly the arbitration clauses, was so clear with respect to the arbitration clause and the finality of the arbitrator's decision, that it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. 2)The agreements in place between HAL & Securtek did not provide for right of appeal on a case by case basis. The agreements set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. The words of the arbitration agreement, particularly those in the context of the terms, were so clear that any appeal would be permitted. The intention expressed in the arbitration terms of both agreements was clear and unambiguous. The statements of the parties clearly indicated that they intended to have the appeal on any questions of legal or factual law. The language of each agreement was so clearly clear that it could not be taken by vagueness or inadvertent omission."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when an object fell off his vehicle and bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle. She claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of metal and reported it did not come from the tractor-trailer. The plaintiff applied to dismiss the application on the basis that the experts' reports did not show the piece had been lodged in the trailer. Dismissing the application, that the defendant met the threshold test of establishing that there was no genuine issue for trial and that the claim had no chance of success. The evidence from the two experts' report did not support the bare allegation that the piece was dangling from the truck. Furthermore, the defendant failed to adduce evidence to support the allegation made in the pleadings. The claim had a real chance ofsuccess and the plaintiff relied on the expert report. The expert report did however have a bare allegation as the piece could have been part of the tractor trailer. The defendants argued that the object fell from the trailer as it passed their vehicle and that it bounced off the vehicle and struck the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The court found that the only way to establish that the alleged piece of piece of wood flew from the defendant's trailer was if there was an agreement between the parties that it had not been there before. The Court also concluded that the evidence from both experts was insufficient to establish a material fact requiring trial. The plaintiffs claim damages for injury to their arms, neck and shoulders."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused had touched her vagina and breasts numerous times on numerous occasions. She alleged that he masturbated himself over top of her clothing. He also touched her breasts and buttocks several times while she was sleeping. She called the police. An expert testified that this could be attributed to the passage through puberty into society that seems to put greater emphasis on body image as opposed to brains. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1)The accused had an opportunity. He had an obligation. He was to protect the children. 2)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. The accused has explanations for each incident. He often slept on the couch in the basement television room. Most of the incidents complained of happened in that room. The complainant's evidence tends towards confirming the accused's evidence. The Court found that the evidence surrounding the behaviour of the accused was circumstantial. There was no evidence connecting his behaviour to the children nor that he was chasing kittens. The only evidence connecting the two was that he often slept in the living room with the children when the children were in school. The children were often in the bedroom with the accused. The alleged incidents occurred in the common room or bathroom of the house. The child had a generally good relationship with the father. The father was not prone to sexual assault. The mother's evidence was that his behaviour was often hostile, sometimes hostile, and sometimes degrading. The following evidence tends toward confirming the allegations: 1)There is no evidence that the father is sexually capable of controlling his children. There is no proof that his actions were condoning sexual assault or that his children were involved in it. 2]There is circumstantially supported evidence that his sexual assault is not based upon the actual acts of the victims but rather on the evidence of his alleged victims. There are no reasonable expectations of what the accused will be capable of doing in a house of this kind. 3)There was no circumstantile evidence that would have confirmed the accused’s evidence. There were no threats. The Child’S Rights Act was not invoked."

His common law spouse died suddenly in 1997 and he has remained the sole care and support for their mentally handicapped child. He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. He must obtain employment when his health allows. Arrears were reduced to $5,000 and enforcement was stayed so long as he continues to make monthly payments of $30 to Maintenance Enforcement.","The parties divorced in 1992 and the appellant was ordered to pay $200 monthly support. He later entered a new relationship and he and his common-law spouse had a mentally handicapped child born in 1995. He remained at home to care for the child, while his common law spouse died suddenly in 1997. He used his commonlaw spouse's modest insurance proceeds for living expenses and he made no payment towards the accumulated arrears of support. In March, 2000, he made an application to vary the support order both by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing the arrear. The application was dismissed without reasons. He appealed the resulting order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court ordered the payment of $30 a month to Maintenance Enforcement. The arrearns were not likely to ever be paid in full and the reduced amount was reduced to $5,000.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was born of the marriage. The mother was the primary caregiver and the father was the father's primary caretaker. The parties disagreed about the best parenting arrangement for their children, and there was a serious disagreement about the nature of pre- and post-school care. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with the father. Therefore, the evidence showed that the mother was not willing to accept any personal responsibility for the children's misbehavior, homework lapses and conflict between the parties. The evidence also showed that one of the parties had a significant debt, which could result in a long term decline in the childrens' income. The court ordered the mother to pay $502 per month for child care and Taekwondo expenses. The plan was not based on the actual income of the mother and was not a joint plan."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of three counts of common assault, one of which related to the use of a weapon while in possession and possession of a prohibited or restricted firearm. He had been acquitted on four of the charges and was sentenced for the ss. 86(1), 88(1) and 95(1)(a) offences. He argued the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy; in failing, in failing not to find that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances; and in failing in failingto find that the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(2) were unconstitutional. The appellant appealed both the findings of guilt and sentence and his proposed release. Allowing the appeal on the basis that the appellant was a flight risk and that his proposed terms of release were inadequate, the court ordered the appellant released on the terms set out in R. v. Ryan. The Crown argued the grounds of appeal were weak and that the applicant had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and that he did not have a reasonable prospect of escape at the time of his release. The court found that the circumstances of the offence made the appellant a flight-risk and that if he wished to flee, he could have done so within eight months. The applicant had a previous conviction for possession of stolen goods, which he had already pled guilty to and had obtained a life sentence on. The circumstances of this offence, and the fact that the accused had been convicted of common and violent offences, made it a flight high risk for him to surrender himself in custody pending appeal."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without the terms of two execution orders previously issued against the plaintiff judgment debtors to the plaintiff, who were successful litigants in this action. The plaintiff moved to have the orders confirmed, in addition to the third party loans. The defendant moved to prevent the third parties from being involved in the litigation. HELD: The order was refused. The court was unable to grant the requested order. It was not clear from the affidavit evidence that the third-party loans were loans that were being used to pay for billed/ unbilled times."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It would be unfair to the accused in any event to waste time and money on a motion that requires the accused's signature on a charter application. There will be no less severe order than the one proposed in R. v. Kutynec (1992), 52 O.A.C. 59; 12 C.R. (4th) 152 (C.A.). 2)The Court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. 3)The order of the Charter voiry dire was not intended to interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the proceeding. The reasons for the decision were not clear. 4)The application was not patently unreasonable. The Charter right was not breached. The police were not always police witnesses. The accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclusion was made. 5)The applicant was entitled to have his/her name called as a witness prior to or at the outset of the application, but the Crown was entitled, in its assessment, to have these people attend as witnesses if, in their assessment, the testimony of such witnesses was required in support of the applicant. The common sense proposition is equally applicable to Charter applications to exclude evidence."

Equal division ordered, to be paid in installments secured against the land. Husband ordered to pay maintenance for support of the children.","The parties' marriage was dissolved at trial in a decree of divorce. The wife commenced an action against the husband shortly after the action was commenced. The husband attended the trial without counsel. He was ordered to pay interim maintenance but withdrew almost a year before the trial commenced. HELD: 1)The evidence presented by the applicant was uncontested. There were no exceptions, exemptions or equitable considerations that would make an equal distribution of matrimonial property unfair or inequitable. 2)The lis pendens registered as item 84-S-26535 were vacated. 3)The exemption to which the respondent may be entitled was not available at the present time. 4)The court found that the respondent's exemption was not open to him."
4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","HELD: The trial was directed on the issues of the residence of the petitioner mother and the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and any s.7 expenses. The respondent father had previously placed the petitioner's needs above his own. The petitioner had the use of his mother's vehicle when she was in Viet Nam and her interest in moving in with him and Jerrilyn, the younger sister, was conditional upon some rules. The father did not meet the threshold provided for in s.9. The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. HELD: 1)The petitioner mother's income was $25,672.37. The Father's income of $108,629.49 was sufficient to support s.8. 2)The parties were responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. 3)The respondent father's income as at the time of the separation was $108.68 was insufficient to determine the appropriate level of child support. 4)The supplementary supplementary expenses were included in the total s. 7 expenses. 5)The father was to pay $284.00 for s.6 expenses. 6)The mother was entitled to costs in the amount of $500."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count; 2) the learned trial judge failed to use exculpatory evidence; 3) the appellant was in a special position on matters of credibility by being able to observe the witness at the time of testimony and compare their observations to the testimony of other witnesses; and 4) the judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant's counsel. The learned trial court found that the evidence concerning the appellant’s reading of the breath samples was not evidence of impairment and, in addition, the evidence of the police officer who had been informed of the right to counsel when the tests were performed accurately described their evidence. The appellant argued that the learned judge erried when he concluded that the tests could not be used as evidence of impaired driving because the appellant had not been informed that the right was not sufficient. The appeal court also dismissed the respondent’ s application that the trial court erred by excluding the evidence respecting the observation of slurred speech by the police officers. The respondent”s application was dismissed."

An adjacent landowner refused to consent to the declaration. The applicant sought a declaration that the consent of the adjacent landowner was not required. Granting the application, that the word 'encumbrance' as defined in s.3(1)(o) of the Act involves a security feature and as there is no security feature to a right of way, unlike a mortgage or lien, it is not an encumbrance. The consent of the adjacent landowner, who had a right of way over a servient tenement, was not required.","The owner of a land subject to a right of way was not required to execute a declaration and consent that were required by the Condominium Property Act. The applicant sought an order directing the Registrar of Condominiums to accept his property without a declaration of consent from users of the right ofway or, in the alternative, a declaration that such consent was not necessary by that section of the Act. Davies applied to the Court for an order mandamus directing the registrar to accept the applicant's property without the requested declaration or, alternatively, a declared that such Consent is not required by that portion of the act. The Registrar refused to consent. The Court applied to declare the right encumbrances encumbrance, for which consent must be obtained, pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Condo Property Act, and granted mandamus. The reasoning on the part of the Court was not persuasive."

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She earned $657.83. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73.","The plaintiff sought wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of her employment. The defendant business sued for the wages that they would have received if she had worked to her end of term. The plaintiff also sought damages for lost wages.

The applicant had worked for several months as a receptionist but had not been paid. The court found that the contract of work was for a term contract and that the applicant had not received employment income in the amount of $2,592.00 and she would not have received holiday pay in the amounts of $149.56 and she earned less from other employment during that time period.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","Electric Limited (the defendant) applied for an order permitting the defendant to amend his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and for leave to apply for the amendment to the admissions. The defendant had previously been a director of the defendant and had filed a defence and counterclaim against the defendants. Oickle had left the company in early 2003 and was no longer working for the defendant. The defendants sued him in early 2004. The plaintiff alleged that Oickle surreptitiously competed against the company during his employment, appropriated opportunities that would have been available to the company, and misused company resources to support his competition. Okeller and his new counsel applied for orders permitting the defence to withdraw the admissions and for an application for an “oppression remedies” pursuant to the Companies act. The appellants sought leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence on which the defendant's rights as existing shareholder were suspended by the consent order and not his rights as a former shareholder. The judge misinterpreted the effect of the April 2004 consent order referred to in the statement of claim. There must be some parameters within which the concepts of 'former shareholder andformer director' confined to the concepts outlined in the terms of the Shareholder Agreement. The new counsel could reasonably be drawn by requiring some connection between the timing of the events which are the subject matter of the proposed derivative action and the position of the applicant as shareholder or director."
e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","The Crown applied for a review under s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. The Chambers judge refused to review the 679 application and the Crown applied to the Supreme Court for a written decision granting the release with conditions. The Appeal Judge refused to issue a written opinion on the issue and the matter was remitted for a new trial. The Crown appealed the decision and sought a review of the 678 application. HELD: The appeal was granted and the decision of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal was set aside. A review of all of the factors cited in the decision was ordered including the requirement that a person on day custody is in custody, the requirement for a return of all cases to the Court on a review, the fact that the appellant was not in custody and the requirement to return cases of non-violent appeals to the Chief justice to review a decision of this Court was dismissed. The appeal judge misinterpreted the definition of custody. The court refused to return any other cases on the basis that a review was unnecessary and the issue of whether or not a person who was on day- parole was in custody would never have arisen as at the moment, Wood was serving his time in custody in penitentiaries. The Supreme Court refused to order a review on the grounds that the decision should not have been made on the information provided by the Crown in the appeal.

The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him.

The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the mother for several years and that her relationship with the mother had been marked by problems due to her explosive temper and her repeated moves around the house. The father had previously been considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of the Child Protection Act. The agency alleged that under the current arrangements the child would be placed in with the biological father residing with the parent and receiving care from a psychological father and that the biological mother would be unable to contact the child due to the mother's explosive temper.

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

He entered not guilty plea and requested the first available date (December 18, 2003) and was granted the date. It was anticipated that one full day would be required as the Defense intended to make a Charter motion and lead evidence. The length of delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. The application for stay of the proceedings was dismissed without further inquiry.

The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that the lease agreement did not fall within s. 2(ak) of the Motor Vehicle Act and that Chrysler was not acting as a servant or agent of the owner. The issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success. The issues were whether the law of vicarious liability extended to leasing companies, whether Chrysler was in the business of renting cars and whether the claim against Chrysler was vicarious. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The trial judge did not err in determining the lease was actually a rental contract pursuant to s. 62 of the Act and in failing to provide any analysis of the Bazley criteria. The lease had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s.62. The reverse onus provision did not apply.  1) The Chambers decision cited the test and found that there was no real chance of the appellants having success on the issues. 2) The lease clearly fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of owner. 3) The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the act, s.2(ak), which permit the granting of summary judgment for an unauthorized action of an unauthorized person. 4) The present administration of justice is considering whether the Act is a proper instrument for determining whether an employer is vicarially liable for an employee's wrongful conduct.  5) The Court reviewed the relevant case law and policy issues. 6) The issue of costs to the appellant was addressed."

The court was able to foresee no harm to the youth or any significant disruption in his life if the stay was lift."
c_1995canlii5671.txt,"The Mother applied to vary the custody provisions of the decree nisis for divorce which provided for joint custody of the parties' 2 children, aged 11 and 9 years. Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","An application for variation of custody given in January 1990 in which the father gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys. The mother had previously applied for interim custody and joint residence with the father. The father had previously been granted sole custody and access to the mother. The petitioner mother had now commenced an application for change in the divorce judgment which would give sole custody to both parents, with the primary residence being with the mother and the father in the summer. The primary residence was with the wife. The parties separated in 1985 and entered into a separation agreement in 1988 providing for joint custody, residence with both parents and generous access to both. The agreement provided that the father would have the primary and secondary residence of the boys, with access to his mother. In 1989 a divorce judgment was made, granting the mother sole custody with the access to her son and allowing the father to move to Ontario. The evidence indicated that the mother had been denied access for the past five years. The applicant mother applied to vary the judgment in 1990 claiming sole custody. The Court dismissed the application. The appeal court noted that this was a material and significant change in circumstances for the children and that a change in circumstance would result in a request for variation. The only change in situation was that the child would be uprooted from his home in Melfort, take the children with him/her, or move to a virtual paradise in Aurora. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The mother's application was not brought as an application under the Divorce Act s.1(6) which provides that neither party could remove the children from the jurisdiction without the express permission of the Court. 2)The father's move was to have the children move to an entirely new community. The nature of the relationship and the access between the parties was beyond reproach. The physical, psychological, social and economic needs of the children were being met by the mother; the father's support and encouragement was substantial. 3)The petitioner mother's move would be in the best interests of the young boys."
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants applied to strike out the Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. They argued that the Chambers decision erred in law in failing to properly apply the Ann's test, or in failing properly to consider policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of a duty of care on a lawyer and non-client. They also opposed the certification on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of cares between a lawyer-non-client and therefore not a class action. They sought leave to appeal from the certification order on the ground that it was devoid of merit and not one that was destined to fail. HELD: The proposed appeal was dismissed. 1)Nothing in the Chambers court's reasons or reasons for dismissing the application or for the dismissal of the Rule 173 (c) were articulated. 2)Nothing that the judge applied to the cause of action in negligence by the representative plaintiffs or to the reasons for the certification of the action was found to be deficient. 3)Nothing which the Chambers lawyer or anyone in his practice or firm did was considered prima facie destined to failure. 4)Nothing the Chambers judges did erred by failing to apply the standard of care or to consider the interplay between the Rule 6(1)(c) and s.6(c)(c)) of the Class Actions Act was considered. 5)The Chambers judge did not err in failing in his duty of justice. The issues to be considered were whether the Chambers justice applied Rule 173, or Rule 173 in his ruling on the motion to dismiss the s.173(c), application, whether the test was applicable to the individual circumstances affecting the plaintiff and whether the plaintiff should have taken appropriate steps to guard against opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. 6)The applicant had no other reasonable choice given the evidence before him was incomplete and conflicted in some respects and that a comprehensive review of expert opinions was required in the context of all evidence that may come before the court during trial. 7)The proposed appeal would have no merit to warrant a decision of the Court of Appeal. The applicant had already established that the issues before the Chambers Judge were not the only issues affecting individual members of the class. Whether the proposed appeal raised an argument or proposition worthy of consideration and not a destined to succeed were the factors to be consider."

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir dave but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and the seizure were incidental to the arrest. The Court found the accused's arrest was justified based upon her reasonable expectation of privacy. The restriction that the search must be truly incidental to a arrest means that the police must be attempting to achieve some valid purpose connected to the arrested. Whether such an objective exists will depend on what the Crown were looking for and why. The actions of the police were not unlawful with respect to either the arrest or search and seizure of the evidence."

It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified.

Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant applied for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the search. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There was sufficient reliability evidence to support the reasonable grounds for issuance of the warrant. The standard of proof for issuance is reasonable and is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The affidavit material did not meet the test in R. v. Debot (1989) 2 S.C.R. 1140, but rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge. Weaknesses in one area may be compensated by strengths in the other. However, it must be found that the evidence was compelling. The affidavit material was found to be reliable and the search conducted without a warrant did not violate the standard of review set out in R.(R. v.) Debot; 3)The evidence met the criteria set out R. (1999) S.L.R.(SCC), [1989] S.CO. 1141. 4)There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. The information predicting the commission of a criminal offence, where that information was based on a 'tip' originating from a source outside the police, was that source credible; and 5)The officer did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s stepmother had called the accused prior to the search of their home and the accused”s father had also called the police. The accused was charged with possession of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code s. 86(1) x 3)) and possession of firearms and ammunition in a prohibited manner (otherwise known as possession of ammunition in the sense of s. 9 and s. 8 of the Criminal Code). The accused“s” in the possession of the firearms and the ammunition at the home were found to be firearms. The Crown had not challenged the evidence presented by the accused and had not proven the accused guilty on any of the charges. The evidence presented was that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of two guns at the house and that the other guns were found in the master bedroom of the accused. HELD: 1)The accused was found not guilty on all charges.  2)The evidence presented did not support the accused having constructive and or joint possession or constructive possession of all of the guns. 3)The Court was unable to accept that the evidence offered by the Crown and the RCMP was not credible. 4)The Crown had established that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in the trial were the same guns. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. 5)The court was unable, without any disrespect intended, to refer to the accused as Kyle. The guilty pleas were not related to the charges against the accused nor did they have joint possession by the other accused. The joint evidence was that a sawing-off shotgun was found in a cabinet in the living room of the respondent” and that a gun found in his mother” s. 2 and a gun in the bedroom of that respondent’d in the house were found at the other end of the street.  6)The respondent“determined his constructive andor joint ownership of the firearm and ammunition by virtue of the fact that he had constructive possession and joint possession with the applicant.

The Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately preceding the commencement of the proceeding. The Court had jurisdiction under the DivorceAct but did not have jurisdiction under The Children's Law Act. The respondent took the position that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts donot have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce proceedings; that the court lacks jurisdiction under s15(1)(b); that the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta and the court should therefore exercise jurisdiction there.

There was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. One of the parties attempted to mislead the court.

First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused was charged with 21 counts under an indictment, of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused sought severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: severance on the basis that the counts would require three separate trials in all; and the potential of the accused deciding to testify on one set of counts but not the others, would result in the accused being exposed to cross-examination by the defence counsel.HELD: The application for severance was dismissed on both the bases proposed. The Court must engage in a weighing exercise of all the relevant factors in deciding whether or not severance is required in the interests of justice.  1) The absence of a true nexus between the counts (the number of counts, the complexity of the evidence and length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called); and the Potential of the Court to Cross-examine the accused on one of the counts could all be conducted back-to-back in the current time slot. 2) The interests of law encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. The obvious risk when counts are tried together is that the evidence in one count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The evidence that the gun was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on prosecution of April 8th events if it supported an inference that the accused is in possession of that firearm on April 14th. If found guilty of possession in relation to that date, certainly the evidence would be Admissible. If the accused were found not guilty of possessing the firearm on that date it would be considered severance. The case law on severance applied also applies to this application. The issue of whether the accused should be tried separately on one or more counts is one factor to be considered. The interests and common interests of the court together play a role in severance application. In this case, the interests and general interests of society do not play together. The law on the application of severance applies to the following factors: 1) the absence of evidence that establishes a prima facie connection to the gun; 2) the evidence set out in Last"

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

The sellers were not represented by legal counsel. They prepared a transfer of the property and sent it to the Land Tittles Office for registration. On August 20, 1997, a title issued in the names of the respondents and Sarauer without the words 'as joint tenants' appearing on the mortgage was registered by the lawyer. On February 15, 1998, Sarauer died in a motor vehicle accident. He was married to the respondent, Mary. The registered owners of the home opposed the requested order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicant had an alternate remedy. Not a remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation in the form of damages from the lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. Damages in the circumstances were not a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief.

HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) Lesly has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is the primary child that the child should, pending trial, live with her, Nevertheless, Kaira will need maximum contact with both parents. 2) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kairae shall, pending a trial, reside in Regina. The residence is to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241; (1996) 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321. Both Shiplack, supra and Stomp, supra are exceptions to the general approach that the status quo is to continue unless there are compelling reasons not to do so as were found in both cases. There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in this instance merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. 3) The respondent admits that there will be a trial respecting Kair's residence. He argues that the Status quo is the attachment the child has with the primaryparent and that is Lesly. He points out that the primary person who has chosen, since Lesly left with KairA, to take the child to Victoria but she has made choices which have resulted in greater expense to insure that Kairas sees both parents, therefore, the respondent shall contribute something to this cost. However it is fair that Mike contribute something. However he contributes something to the cost."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The primary issue in this case was whether the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the petitioner and to the court. The petitioner had moved from Alberta to Nova Scotia and had been placed in the supervised care of her common law partner. The respondent had previously been placed with another child protection agency, which had been approached by the Agency and had since been terminated. The applicant sought to have the supervision order dismissed as the Agency wanted to assume sole responsibility for the children. The child protection officials at the time of the hearing believed that the Agency had failed to inform the petitioner of the children's future plans. The children were placed with the common law spouse, who had since moved to Nova Scotia and who was now the guardian of the other child, L.M. The common law wife had recently returned from a dangerous common law relationship and the parties' relationship had deteriorated. L.Ms. expressed concern that the agency had failed in its responsibilities to monitor and report to the Court the children’s new residence. The consultation with the child protection professionals was ongoing and the children had moved to Alberta. HELD: The court found that the information concerning L.m.’ (the common law husband’) partner was simply not germane to the decision made by the agency. The court ordered the joint custody of the two children to be transferred to L.L.M., based on the information provided by the common-law partner. L’M.”s partner” had been a person of interest in the children and had not been properly vetted by the parents prior to being appointed guardian. L&M. had advised the parties that it would not be appropriate to transfer the children to another partner until the children were 18 and 19 years of age. The joint custody arrangement was not in place until the age of 21. The father”determined that the joint care arrangement was best for the two and the 18 year olds, and that L.F. would be responsible for the rest of the family. The mother was to assume the interim custody responsibilities of the three children."

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had worked in the Provincial Court Building for some time prior to being charged. The complainant had recently commenced employment as a clerk and the accused had made comments to her that she should not take lightly. She alleged that the accused touched her leg, touched her face and caused a bruise. The Crown sought to exclude the statement as it was not tender. The complainant testified that the defendant had asked her to take a position in the Court Department and that he had been detained. She also alleged that he touched her legs and that she felt humiliated. The defendant was convicted of sexual assault. HELD: The Court found that the statements to the Authorities were not tender and therefore, could not be used in evidence. There was no consistency as to the incidents prior to and during the trial and the court was required to consider the relationship between the witness and the defendant. The statements were not to be tender."

He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant applied for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application is opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: The application was allowed and the court found that the applicant did not have the resources to discharge this liability now, nor in the next several years. The debt in effect can be cancelled or affirmed. The AG advised that it would not question the applicant's good faith with respect to the loan. Accordingly, the court reviewed what it found to be evidence respecting the other requirement under the subsection, whether his financial difficulty was so extensive that he would be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan: whether his current income was so limited that he could contribute enough to significantly reduce the liability."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two boys. The father, who was a pediatrician, claimed that the mother, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused him of physically and sexually abusing the children. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The children had been receiving a report from the pediatrician in support of an order for home study. The report was prepared for use in family court custody proceedings and their maker was protected by law from being sued. 3)The evidence showed that the alleged abusers had been using the children's reports to attack and threaten the mother's credibility. 4)The facts were set out in a detailed report prepared by the mother. The evidence showed the alleged abuses were not credible and the report was grossly defamatory. 5)The conduct of the parents was characterised by hostility, accusations, intimidation and duress. 6)The statements of the alleged victims were found to be defamatories of the Declaration of Rights. 7)The court was not prepared to accept the mother’s admission that she had written the reports in the hope of obtaining custody for the children and that the evidence supported her allegations. 8)The defendant was found to have acted in good faith in the report and in good conscience in the execution of his duties. 9)The plaintiff was ordered to pay $600 costs to the defendant. 10)The co-defendants were ordered to forfeit any profits or assets they might have in the cause. 11)The plaintiffs were ordered not to contact the children even if they had been sued. 12)The parties agreed to a six month wait in order to have the report published. The co- defendants were ordered by the court to have their counsel assessed and then to pay the plaintiff’ s costs. 12"")The court found that the statements of fact were defamative and that they constituted malice. 13)The fact that the defendant was the mother who prepared the report did not serve to justify the six month delay.

The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of the defendants, unlawful confinement on the pilot, breach of contract by the airline and breach of the plaintiff's rights. The defendant plead guilty to conspiracy and breach and submitted to the Court that his action should be dismissed. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although no specific case law was provided to the court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with regard its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. The question to be determined is whether or not it is plain and obvious that the applicant's claim does not disclose a cause of action. HELD: The certification application was dismissed. The Court held that although the applicant would not be ousted, the test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause of actions. The test to determine whether or Not it is obvious that an applicant's allegation of negligence, breach or other non-compensatory damages is true and the Court should be reluctant to deny his or her day in court. The amended statement of claims alleges negligence on behalf the defendants and unlawful confinement by the owner of the airline, Rampersaud, and breach by the defendants MyTravel and Signature.

d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; what, pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Divorce Act, the interim spousal support order; what retroactive support should be payable by the father to the Mother; what if any retroactive spousals should be ordered in this matter; interim spOUSAL support; interim childcare costs; interim costs. HELD: 1) The Court was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father did not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the wife once he had satisfied his child support obligations. At this interim stage, the matter should not affect the right of the mother to pursue spousa support in the future. Although the father will be stretched, the mother's evidence discloses that both children, but more particularly Kody, was in need of a specialized educational program given his current problems at school. Although it is clear from the evidence that the mother has an entitlement to interim spouse support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 2) The Sylvan Learning Centre expenses were necessary and reasonable. The father's share of both childcare costs and the Sylvan learning centre expense was equal to 71% of the total cost. 3) The mother was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400 to the father pursuant to S. 15.3(1) of The DivorceAct."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in the proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the surplus. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surpluuses may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplums are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand a class of 6,000 potential claimants, none of whom have been given notice of the interpleading application or of Ag credit's application. The argument that the surpleuses are property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it is not supported by the evidence. 2) While there is an arguable case that the insurer's claim to the surplus belongs to the clients, it is concerned it is in the interests of others to participate in the recovery of the surplus. The insurer claims no interests in the subject matter in dispute other than for charges or costs; b) it does not collude with any of the claimants. The only conclusion drawn from the evidence was that the underlying issues were those of the insured clients and not between the parties. 3) While the insurer had an argent case it had to pay the premiums with its own money and thus any overpayment of premiums or surplunduses arising under the contract were its property. 4) While it claims no entitlement to surplus funds under an insurance policy, it also had a fiduciary duty to distribute the surplus to the insureds. It was not clear what the underlying underlying issues might be. 4-5) While some of the borrowers may have an argented claim to these surplias, the evidence available to the Court is that the insured client may be the persons entitled to receive the surplus or, in the alternative, that the economic realities of the litigation necessarily required an order for payment of the funds. The court shall make appropriate decisions as to the appropriate manner of payment."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1 year probation order. He appealed the conviction. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist, by making factual errors in law, by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof, and 2)Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the trial judge failed to properly consider the test for a defence of necessity. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction and an order for a new trial.  3)The court found that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries. They were immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant held an issue regarding liability for injuries suffered when she fell while shopping in a produce department of the defendant. The plaintiff had been in the store for several months and had received the first five physiotherapy treatments over a five week period. The evidence conflicted with the doctor's notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the slip and fall. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendants did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the produce department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the victim. The Evidence did not Support an inference the plaintiff’s footwear caused/ was a contributor factor to her fall. 4)There was no evidence the defendant deviated from its policy in maintaining uniform cleaning procedures in the produce store. The sweep log showed that at 2:52 pm on a puddle of water on the ground, the floors were wet and dry. 5)The plaintiff was not aware of the water on a floor of the store prior to the incident nor did she know its presence. The logs did not raise any adverse inference that either party had been negligent in maintaining the cleanliness of the premises. 6)There were no logs filed by the defendant showing any unusual danger or that the defendant did not act in a fashion that would accord with the 'usual danger' standard. 7)The affidavit evidence of two assistant managers employed at the time of the accident confirmed the cleaning regimen in place at the store. 8)Statutes filed by and evidence of the owner and occupier prior to and after the incident were not relied upon. 9)Statements filed by employees and others with respect to their employment prior to or during the incident did not disclose any of the requisite details. 10)The Court concluded that the defendants met the statutory standard of maintenance required by the Federal Trade Commission and were not liable or negligent. 11)There should have been no inference drawn by"
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter in the death of her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of three grounds: 1) the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to both the seriousness of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it; 2) the trial judge erred by failing to give appropriate weight to the aggravating features of the case and by overemphasizing the significance of the factors he found to be mitigating; and 3) the respondent was clearly alive to the seriousness Of The offence and had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Court found the respondent had a more extensive criminal record than the respondent, who was raising four children with developmental and health problems and severe problems of her own; and 4) the Court found that the respondent failed to take proper weight when it was apparent the child was injured. The Court noted that post-traumatic stress disorder (PATD) is a serious and life-threatening condition and the symptoms of it can be treated as mitigating factors. The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth as an aggravating factor. The court found that it was unlikely that the sentence would be appropriate in a society where post-secondary education is not mandatory. The sentence imposed was demonstrably fit."

He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four offences, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. The surety had signed the recognizant and the accused was released on bail. The trial date was scheduled for June 8/1999 but was subsequently adjourned due to the accused's refusal to pay a writ of fieri facias. The sheriff had attended the accused residence for a period of time but did not have an opportunity to read the recognizer before signing it. The bailiff testified that he did not get an opportunity because he had a disability and was not able to work. He said he signed the document having full knowledge of the surety's obligations and liability. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1) The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recogniazance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was unaware of that fact. The principles of judicial discretion were applied to the case of the accused. 2) The surete had no idea of his obligation under the agreement.

The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land by the City of Halifax City Council in 1993 was a resolution to expropriate the land for widening the Bedford Highway. The expropriated land was located entirely within the original street width, leaving only the footings protruding into the claimant's property. The City Council later approved the abandonment of the expropriations, which was considered a major event in the expatriation of the land. The appellant appealed the decision of the City to abandon the expository land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. At the appeal hearing in early November, the city received an appraisal report from the appellants' solicitor which concluded that the value of the property was higher than the assessed value. At that hearing, the Taxing Master made his final decision, which amounted to $5,855 in full compensation for the appellant's interest. The appellants appealed the taxing master's decision, alleging three errors. 1)The appellant's solicitor did not actually examine the completed work. The taxing Master reviewed the invoices and reviewed the documents. 2)The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the Taxation Master confirmed. 3)The appellants had been awarded solicitor-client costs in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours of time spent on the file. The solicitor-office account was taxed by the city and in a decision dated August 25, 1995 he reduced the amount to $14,000. 4)The court was bound by the decision as it is of the Court of Appeal. The determination is not solely on whether the services have actually been incurred but also to the extent to which such costs are reasonable. The interpretation of the law and the application to the taxation officer's decision extends to the interpretation of law and to the application of the tax to the purpose of the legislation. The law and application to tax and fees is a regular part of interpretation of legislation and the court was satisfied the approach was reasonable."

The refusal charge was dismissed and the appellant was convicted of impaired driving. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way. Thus, she must not have thought that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. Failure to act cannot be considered by the trial judge as part of the reasonable and probable grounds.","The appellant was charged with impaired driving contrary to the facts and contravening s.686(1)(b)(ii) and s.687(1), which respectively allows an acquittal and a new trial to be ordered. The appellant had been drinking, had a very slight accident and failed the SL-2. While driving the appellant had noted certain other features of the vehicle, prompting the police officer to request the appellant take an 'alert' on the device having read to the appellant the requisite demand. When the appellant failed the test, the police officers followed the appellant to where he parked his vehicle. The police officers accompanied the appellant back to the parked vehicle and noted certain features of his vehicle, which led the officer to ask the appellant if he had bloodshot eyes and a moderate smell of alcohol on him. The trial judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the 'Breathalyzer' demand. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. The findings of the learned trial judge do not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the accused had been driving, had been very slight, had had a Very slight accident, and failed both the SL and SL-3. However, the trial judge did address the defence evidence adduced by the defence in respect to the impaired driving charge. The operative part of the decision is that the appellant was driving a vehicle that had been observed by the police on the previous day when he was struck by the truck. The left side of the appellant's vehicle rubbed against the vehicle when the officer read to him the requisite demands. When he failed the tests, the officer requested the appellant have the Breathalyzer test, which the appellant refused.

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appealed a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in her home which was subject to periodic tenancies. She sought possession of the unit pursuant to s. 70 of The Residential Tenancy Act.

Section 20 of The residential Tenancies Act provides that to create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the landlord and tenant must enter a written tenancy agreement. The Tenant states that he signed the lease in good faith. The fact that the landlord did not know that there was a second tenant living in the home does not take the matter any further. The evidence presented by the tenants was that they did not even notify the landlord of what they intended to do and only two actually knew of the listing. The Hearing Officer found that the hearing officer made an error in law in finding that the tenants had not signed a proper tenancy agreement and that the Hearing Officer made an incorrect error in finding she had no jurisdiction to handle the matter properly. The tenants appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed with respect to the landlord's claim for possession. Section 19 of The Act provides for the hearing of any tenancy agreement between a landlord and a tenant. The tenancy agreement was not invalid. The Court held that the tenant had not shown any entitlement to the rights that the lease affords. The issue was whether the Hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession pursuant to ss. 70 and s. 80 of the Residential Tenances Act. Section 70 of the Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant, those circumstances do not exist.

The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake.

The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The buildings were an eye-sore. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal, that any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s. 24 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any proposed amendment to s. 363 must be construed in a manner that doesnot invoke s24 of the charter. If the legislators wish to have the actions of the respondent considered an offence an appropriate amendment to subsection would be necessary. 2)Any amendments must be able to meet the constitutional requirements of s.6 of the Act. 3)Any amendment must also be able, if need be, to include the exterior finishes of buildings. 4)The trial judge made no error in law.

d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the trial court based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence are based on misapprehendions of evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence of the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found that the judge's misappreciation of the law and her failure to give proper effect to it are based upon misapportunes of the record. 3) The trial judge misapplied evidence. There is no other way in which the appellant’s evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. The evidence bearing on the appellant was highly material to that critical issue and evidence bearing upon his credibility was highly relevant to that issue. The misappointment was substantial and material. The trial court ascribed the evidence to the Evidence of Services, which was relevant to the removal of the children. The inference drawn by this evidence was not supported by the record and the court found a miscarriage for justice."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position in the private sector. The employee at the time thought he could leave the company on three months notice but was offered nothing in lieu of notice. The defendant refused, claiming the clause in the agreement which required the employee to give 30 days notice was not relevant. The action was allowed in part because the defendant had not explicitly stated that the clause required the employer to give the plaintiff 30 days' notice. As the plaintiff was a high level employee and had experience in several positions, he assumed the position of project manager for the company would be more suitable. He assumed the job would be for a lower level position and the employee would receive compensation for his time in the position. The documents filed at the trial all stated that reasonable notice of termination was required initially when there was no written contract, then when the contract was extended to include additional positions. The claim that the 30 days served as notice was dismissed without cause. The court found that reasonable notices must not be given in the nature of contractually binding agreements."

The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant and respondent were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a daughter.

The applicant applied pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act to vary the spousal support provisions of their Agreement. Application allowed; the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Act and that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant.

The Respondent was to maintain in force an unencumbered policy or plan of life insurance in an amount of not less than $175,000. The Applicant's mortgage payment was increased by $500 per month and there was no evidence that she had any debt.

As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay.

He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court.

The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to dismiss the action on the basis that the defendants had prevented them from enforcing the terms of the January 1997 contract between the plaintiff and Triple P Holdings. The motion had been dismissed on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. The plaintiffs had constructed their case in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The single issue of privity was overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. HELD: The case was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City of Regina, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendant made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work and the contract between them and the City is not incorporated by a specific or general reference. 2)The single issue was overwhelmed in the larger issues as to the extent to which the contract was breached.

He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant Wal-mart Canada Corp. which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion was joined by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant. In the one motion the Union seeks an order striking and removing virtually all the material filed in support of the application. In both motions the Union applies for an order dismissing Wal- Mart's motion. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Wal-marts should be dismissed. 1) The only documents which are properly before the court are the files of the parties. The files of all the applicants and their affidavits are admissible. 2) Wal- mart's admissions that there was interference by the Department of Labour with the application are not admissible to prove that there is interference with the Board's operation. 3) The transcript of the radio broadcast is admissible but there is no admissible evidence of interference with its operation. The admissibility of the comments by the Board member on the radio was not demonstrated. There is no documentary evidence of the interference with Board members' reading of the newspapers. There was no admissiblilty or reliability to the allegations. The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon are admissibles. 4) Wal Mart's affidavit of fact and reliability are adduced. There must be no necessity for their admission.

There are no adducements of the statements of claims filed by the members of the Board. The only evidence that exists is the transcript of a radio broadcast.

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007. The Provincial Court judge had applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the incorrect legal test, and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (LGB) test is a valid form of inquiry and the test for whether an accused can communicate effectively with counsel is of the essence. The respondent met the criteria found in subsections (a) and (b) of the LGB and was found fit to stand Trial. However, the trial judge also mischaracterized the respondent's ability to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system'. The limited capacity test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. The adoption of too high a threshold for fitness will result in an increased number of cases in which the accused will be found unfit to Stand trial."

Here, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. HELD: The Crown shall make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop; (c) the reasons for each stopped; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (f) Specific information of any additional grounds for those searches that had been applied and many times. The Notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as well as some details relating to the required disclosures. The notes will presumably provide some details as to the reasons behind each stop."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.",HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. The appellant argued that the sentence should have been increased because the trial judge failed to adequately address the inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony. The court found that the inconsistencies were not consistent with the complainant’s testimony at trial and were not unreasonable. The appeal against sentence was allowed because the sentence was less than a day.

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon.

The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.",The 37 year old male was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for sexual purposes with his hand contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was ordered to provide sufficient samples of his bodily substances so that a DNA analysis could be conducted. He had not completed high school education at the time of the offence and was trying to enroll in a sex offender registrar program. He said he had plans to do so in the fall of 2009 but that he was afraid of losing his job. HELD: The accused was sentenced in the range of 6 to 9 months. The sentence was increased to 10 years from the time the order was imposed. The sentences were to be followed by a 1 year probation with an order respecting the terms of his parole. The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record and he did not previously serve time in jail. The court found that the offences were non-related to the offence.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'.

However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","The parties agreed that the case turned on the interpretation of article XIV of the joint venture agreement, s.14.01(s).

HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for access to his children at a settlement conference. The mother denied the children access and requested that they be permitted to have a one-hour hearing with the father. The father argued that his medical condition and his use of marijuana had contributed to his difficulty in driving. He requested that the hearing be moved to November 5, 2007 because he was afraid of the traffic. The conciliator met with the parents and the father and requested the access be lifted. The parties agreed to allow the father's use of drugs and the ability to access his children. The doctor also requested that a review of the child support guidelines be conducted. The assessor reviewed the evidence and found that concerns relating to the father’s medical condition, marijuana use and driving were minor concerns. The evidence showed that the father was able to drive safely on routes that permit speeds over 80 km/h. The concerns relating the father were minor and his marijuana use was not the only concern. The court found that the concerns relating his children were minor as they did not concern his medical conditions. The concern was that the marijuana use would affect his ability to drive. The administration of the marijuana policy in the province was also discussed. The Court ordered the administration of a cost award to the parents."

The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.",FIAT.

The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub- contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor.

The sub-contracted contractor arranged with All Ports Insulation and Asbestos Services Inc. to supply labour and materials. Although the respondent sent a subcontract to All Ports, no formal contract was ever executed. At issue was whether the Mechanics' Lien Act applied, and if so, if so what amount would the respondent be obliged to pay to the applicant? HELD: 1)The applicant had not proven a cause of action against the general or quasi-legal contractor. 2)The respondent had not demonstrated a cause for action against either party. 3)The letter from London Guarantee to the plaintiff contained no words of explicit promise to pay and there was no mention of something of value passing from the respondent to the respondent. 4)If the Mechanics's Lien act had been applicable, the applicant would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. 5)The only authority cited with respect to the purpose and effect of Clause 4 of the Bond was Johnson Controls Ltd. et al.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying it for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. He wants to expound on the fact that his three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: 1) The respondent’s application to reduce or expunce child support is dismissed. The arrear is $183,746. The petitioner’ s. 865 arreary was calculated based on his income. 2) The applicant had no money to spend on medical expenses. He had the ability to pay child support willingly. It was repugnant to even suggest reducing the arreARS. 3) The arsars were calculated using the respondent”s income. The respondent had not been paying child support for many, many years and had to resort to welfare to provide for the children. 4) The petitioner had no means to obtain employment that paid her an average annual income of $109,912. 5) The court calculated the arsages based on the respondent and his income over the years. 6) The Court found that the respondent had no reasonable means to reduce the arraars. 7) The fact that the petitioner had little means to spend other than to care for the child and that he did not have the ability, in all the circumstances, to pay the arrow, was an undue hardship. 8) The father’d been paying support for 25 years. The fact he had no income at the time of the order and had no assets at the present time, combined with the fact he was working in private practice, did not relieve him of the obligation. 9) The wife was not able to work as a nurse. She was on long term disability. 10) The husband was paying child and child support. The wife had no motivation to move to Milwaukee. She continued to care after she passed. 11) The parties agreed that the arREars owed by the respondent should only be expunged where the petitioner established on a balance of probabilities that he could pay the child support payable in the future.

Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment.

He also argued the attachment was intended to get reaction from the student. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The evidence of the witness who was not counsel at trial was examined. The trial judge did not enter a voir dire to determine if the witness had any relevant evidence. The Crown appealed. The appeal raised issues of admissibility of evidence, appropriateness of questions asked of the cross-examination of the appellant in cross- examination and was there sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements. The requisite intent can be framed either way. The accused was found guilty of utterning a threat in an email, to cause Death to a computer science student contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal held that the evidence of a witness who had been called as a witness was not admissible. The court found that the trial judge had no authority to determine whether the witness’s evidence was admissible or not. The issue was whether the evidence was part of the “narrative” and whether the Crown should seek an acquittal, a new trial or a conditional discharge.

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one of the break and enter witnesses to the witness box.

The Crown advised court of the intention to use the witness's name, a witness named in the disclosure given to defence, and the defence advised the Court of the Crown's intention to invite the witness to the box. The defence objected on the basis that the accused's client had been sitting in court listening to other Crown witnesses. The accused's defence lawyer should have had to sit through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness. HELD: The accused was not permitted to call the witness. The stay of proceedings was out of the question. The court found that the defence had not succeeded in intimidating the accused and that the disclosure by the Crown of the witness' intention to be called by the court seriously damaged the accused’s right to effective representation with respect to the cross examination of this witnesses. 1)The Crown had not disclosed its intention in disclosing its non-disclosure to the defence. The judge found that requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness and requiring another counsel to sit in during the trial in order be as as effective in the examination of the witnesses, and requiring the Crown to call a third lawyer to sit under the examination-in-chief would not be appropriate. That lawyer should not have sat through the whole Crown case and the entire examination in chief in order for him to be effective in that cross- examination of that witness. 2)The court found the following with respect respect to non-closure: A stay of the proceedings was ruled out; the accused was awarded judgment for breach of s.2(d)(ii) and s.3(vi) of the Charter. 3)The accused”s right of full answer and defence was prejudiced only with respect the cross cross--examination.

HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","FIAT: The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal the certification order of the defendant in the class action. The defendants sought leave to apply for appeal on only one aspect of the certification. All other aspects of the leave to appealed application, including that relating to the breach of duty of care cause of action, were dismissed. The situation that now exists is that the class Action will definitely advance, although until after the appeal concerning the CPA cause of actions is finally determined, it is not known whether the class actions will proceed on the basis of one cause of offense or two. The plaintiffs requested a conference call to discuss the next steps. The conference call was convened in September 2010 at which time the parties were given the opportunity to discuss possible moves. The matter was pending before the Court of Appeal and the matter could well advance before the appeal. The order and judgment certified the within action as a class action with the exception of the CAA cause of cause of Action. Steps can now be taken to move the matter forward concurrently with the appeal even though there is an appeal pending on only the one aspect the certification ordered. HELD: 1)Leave was granted to appeal on the portion of the certification order that pertained to the cause of investigation relating to alleged breaches of the Consumer Protection Act, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1 (the CPA) and all other aspects were dismissed by the defendants. 2)Leave should not be taken in the context of a class-action proceeding where the entire cause of conduct (the CA cause ofaction) is under review. Steps must be taken at the time of the appeal on all other matters. Steps should be taken as the matter is pending before and beyond the Court's jurisdiction. 3)Leave granted in the event that the matter was still pending before it the matter will definitely proceed, although, until after after the Appeal concerning the causeof action is finally resolved, it was not known if the class will proceed based of one causes of action or two (CPA causeof actions). 4)The plaintiffs requested further leave in the matter pending the appeal of the original certification order. A conference call convened in August 2010 at the appropriate time the defendants were given an opportunity to speak to the issue of whether it was appropriate to move this matter forward at this time given that there is also an appeal in the CCA cause of the action and that there was an appeal on one aspect in the certification Order.

The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband, who was deceased and his estate was represented by his executors. The chambers judge dismissed the application, with the result that the application would not be of sufficient importance to the Court of Queen's Bench or to the administration of justice. The application could be interpreted as setting out two grounds of appeal that would allege the chambers judge either committed an error in principle or disregarded material facts when he decided not to vacuum the certificates of pending lawsuit. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudicially upon the course or outcome of the action. 2)The applicant is a party to a class action lawsuit. It is not a new issue. Nor is it a new and controversial issue. The proposed appeal doesn't raise a class issue. It just happens that a proposed appeal may raise a question of importance to a Court of Appeal proceeding before a panel of judges. 3)The application is not of sufficient merit. The draft notice of appeal is not confined to whether the chambers court exercised its discretion within the criteria which bear upon the proper exercise of his judicial discretion. 4)The draft notice would have to be revised to frame the grounds of Appeal as falling within the adjudicative framework applicable to appeals from discretionary orders."

The complainant willingly took part in a fight club after which the accused followed him and engaged in a second physical altercation with him. During the fight, the parties fell into a dresser, onto the floor and out a window. At some stage of the fight, the complainant sustained a nasal fracture, which was the basis of the charge. Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.","Six persons shared an upstairs apartment. The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties had been drinking and had come to the conclusion that the fight club was a bonding ritual that the men did to rid themselves of their frustrations. One of the men sustained a nasal fracture while in the fight. The accused, who had invited the complainant to join them in the basement, used his arms around the complainant and they stumbled to the floor. The other sustained a broken nose. The Court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. The offence was committed against the complainant, and the offence was motivated by a desire to preserve his health. The court found that on the evidence the accused had no intention of causing bodily harm to the complainant. The assault was foreseeable and was motivated in part by the complainant's discomfort with the assault. The evidence did not support the accused's assertion that he had a reasonable apprehension that he would cause bodily harm. The trial judge found that it was reasonable to conclude that the assault was motivated primarily by the desire to protect himself. The crime was committed in a manner consistent with the principles of self-defence established in R. v. Petel 1994 CanLII 133 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R.3, [1994][1993] SCC)."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused, a young person who had been subject to release conditions in relation to a weapons offence, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of a Metis youth contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and to failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to the YCJA. The Crown applied under s. 42(9) of The Youth Criminal Justice Act for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence pursuant to s 42(8) of that Code. The accused was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and a 1:1 weapons prohibition. The young person was prohibited from possessing firearms, ammunition, knives, or guns outside of his residence. He was ordered to have a DNA sample taken as part of his sentence. HELD: The court found the accused was a serious offender and designated him a serious offence pursuant pursuant to ss 42(11) and 42(12) of this Code.  1) The accused had spent 95 days in pre--sentencing detention and he had been required to participate in a personal and anger management program.

9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appeal from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board was one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the previous two grounds of appeal. 1) Market Mall was the oldest enclosed shopping centre in Saskatoon and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1982 and 1992. As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskat, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) The appeal must be allowed on a same basis in respect of the 1997 assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskata. It was clear that the committee was not satisfied that the appellant had established that there was any excess of non-revenue producing common area, or any accepted standard as to ratio of revenue to non revenue producing areas. Nor was it satisfied that appellant had accepted that there were any lack of economic utility in the common areas or that the underground parkade was functionally obsolete. 3) Market mall was a commercial building performing that function. It had been categorized with all others in its Commercial Building neighbourhood and its Maf would have risen to 0.95."

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to review a certificate issued pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act, s. 61 of the Department of Labour, declaring that the city owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director of Labour Standards issued a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review the assessment. At the hearing the Director filed a letter reduced the assessment by $318 to $300.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the residence of the accused was issued in April 1997 primarily directed at the residences of the applicants. The Crown alleged that this action on the part of the police rendered the search unreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: 1)Leave to cross-examine was granted in the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. Leave should be left to the exercise the discretion thereof. 2)The authorization for the electronic surveillance was set aside as information obtained from the electronic monitoring was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants were derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 3)The granting of leave to cross examine was not the preserve of the court. The granting of the leave to exercise the exercise was strictly for the discretion. Leave to cross cross-amine should be limited by the trial court to questions that are directed to establish that there was no basis upon which the authorization could have been granted. 4)The Crown did not err in arguing that the authorization should not be set aside. The appeal court held that R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106, was a strong directive to that end. The court found that given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code there is no reason that the granting of a leave to examine should be the preserve OFA. The decision of R. vs. West was a reviewable decision. 5)The applicant’s evidence was admissible on an application to set off the authorization. The applicant”s counsel did not seek to call amplification evidence pursuant to s.(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. 6)The court reviewed the various breaches of the R.V. West Act and found that the Crown had not exceeded its authority in applying for the authorization and the accused were not at fault. 7)The accused were granted leave to apply for the privilege to cross question at trial pursuant to the provisions of s. 186(1)(b) of The Criminal Code and the Order of the"

Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned.

HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellant evidence had come into the possession of the appellant after trial. Some of the documents include correspondence and the appellans' notes for presentation to the council of the rural municipality. As these documents were in the possessionof the appellents, the documents could have been adduced at trial; 2)The uncertainty suggested by the appellation that the word livestock is uncertain could not be proven. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments. 3)The evidence that had come in the appellands after the trial was examined. Some documents included correspondence and notes for presentations to council of a rural municipality and a letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs. 4)The respondents did not give notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. The uncertainty suggested that the appellains rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. The respondents were in position to peruse the bylaws relating to districts labelled 'hamlet' and to learn of the rules governing their property including the rule prohibiting cattle in that zoning district. 5)The three bylaws tendered by the appellantons did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial, as the basic planning statement, not to the zoning bylaw or to the bylaws under which the appellas were convicted, and their evidence related to the meaning of livestock in the by-law. 6)The application to add new evidence on the appeal was dismissed because the uncertainty suggested could not exist under Bylaws 2-1994 and 2-1993.

This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","The father was granted custody of the child. The issue had been with translation services and obtaining a transcript from the mother. The father had moved away from Nunavut before he knew the mother was pregnant with their child. For the past two years, the child had resided with his mother. Access was granted to the child every summer from the second week in July until the fourth week in August which is seven full weeks. There was an unreasonable period of time from the date of the application to the decision of the Family Court. The problem had been the unavailability of a translator in Nova Scotia. The mother had reason for sending the child to Nova Scotia, to learn more about the Inuit culture and to be with his father. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the Child would require the Court to consider. Access would be every summer in the year 2001, starting on Sunday and ends on Saturday and reaching the end of October in year 2001. This would be in the context of answering the question with whom would the best interests and welfare of the son be most likely achieved. The Court had sympathy for the mother and her situation. The child had been in the mother's home for a few months and had been doing well in school. The family had a new relationship and the child was doing well with his school program. The applicant mother had expressed a wish for the child's return to her native country, to be able to learn some Inuktitut.

Access will be every day in the city of Barrington from the endof October until the beginning of November which is 7 full weeks and will take place in the years 2001. Given the time period, it is only one of a number of factors to be considered in arriving at what is best for the son. The other factors are the mother, the environment, the father, the cultural aspects which include an Inuit extended family and physical environment to enhance this and the Inuktiut language and the willingness of the mother to facilitate contact with the other parent. The court reviewed the relevant section of the FAMMA and found that although the mother had a difficult time adjusting to the new environment, it was important that she be given custody. The issues were: 1) the best wishes of the young child; 2) the mother who had a permanent residence and a steady income; 3) the father who had permanent residence"

There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs were associated in the practice of law and one of the defendants was a solicitor of record. The Originating Statement of Claims was filed in 2006. The plaintiffs alleged that RBC and its representative, Patrick O'Neill, counselled them to make investments in listed companies despite their possession of information about the companies that was not communicated to the plaintiffs. RBC denied any wrongdoing, and argued that the delay was entirely due to the plaintiff's solicitor and not any other individual. Ruling, the delay is of inordinate and inexcusable. There can be no injustice in bearing the consequences of his own fault. Ruled out in Savoie v. Chipman, J.A., the Court held that the delays are entirely due in part to the negligence of the plaintiff’s solicitor and his failure to take appropriate action. The action was dismissed for want of prosecution in 2008. The Court held in Moir that a delay of three years is not inordinate. It is not an inordinate period of time in which to bring a case. The delay is entirely due the negligenceof the plaintiff, whose solicitor and he were blameless. It might be unjust to deprive him of the chance of recovering the damages he could otherwise have received. Rounding out the factors in this case were the delay caused by the death of the original solicitor, the difficulty in determining relevance, the quantity of documents to review, the need to review documents carefully to identify confidential information on non-party investors, and the time required to review some 20 communications for privilege."
8_2003nsfc1.txt,"The mother of a child applied to have the court set aside its decision granting permanent care and custody of the child to the Agency. When the applicant did not appear at the original hearing, her counsel withdrew as solicitor of record. She now argued that she had made a mistake in the hearing date. Application allowed; previous order set aside and matter set down for disposition review hearing. In order to protect the best interests of the child, the court must take jurisdiction and set aside the previous order to allow the applicant another disposition review hearing.","The applicant mother applied for interim care and custody of her child, born in 1993. She had previously been granted access to the applicant's home and had made an application to set aside the permanent care and control order made in respect of the child's biological father. Application to set-off order for permanent care dismissed; child custody granted to the Agency with access on November 12, 2002. The mother withdrew from the application and requested that the court set aside its order for interim custody and permanent care. The applicant failed to recognize and take control of the problem and had failed to provide adequate instructions to the father as to when and where she would receive the necessary medical attention and the proper medication. She withdrew from all contact with the father and did not provide any written instructions. The father was granted access by a judge appointed to review the father's application and the child care and care orders. The court found that because the applicant had failed in her responsibilities under the child protection order, the court had set aside permanent care, custody and access to allow her to have another disposition review hearing."

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

c_2010nssc41.txt,"The bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of approximately $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans. Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act directing that Paragraph 178(2)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loans. The Bankrupt had outstanding studentloans of about $39,000. The proposal was made by the Government of Nova Scotia through the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations Debtor Assistance. The debts date back 13 years. She made her proposal in 2000 and was no further ahead. Another five years have passed. She completed the Consumer Proposal in 2005 and was advised that it would discharge in five years. Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. Relief was granted. The Court considered the factors above in their totality; the Bank's application was dismissed; the court was not required to order the application to be dropped. The court found that the Bank was acting in good faith in its approach and did not act in a fashion inconsistent with the objectives of the BIA. The applicant had acted with good faith. She had applied for interest relief, which was ineffective against the student loans, but then learned it was ineffective. The repayment of the loans would take 10 or more years. The creditor appeared at the hearing to oppose the application. The application was adjourned to February 4, 2010.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused was charged with possession of stolen goods and conspiracy to sell drugs. The accused was to appear on a charge under s.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982. The defence asked for full disclosure in a usable format. The Crown argued that since the accused had the skill, sophistication and equipment to obtain the information requested, the disclosure should be provided in a reasonably accessible manner. Defence sought to have the disclosure in usable format and the issue dealt with by 'Laporte inventory'. HELD: The accused is to be provided with full disclosure pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24. The issue is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  1) There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. There is. 2) There was no need to provide hard copies of all documents. There was. 3) The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date was appropriate in that it has been reasonably accessible and did not detract from the right of the accused in the circumstances to make full answer. The disclosure provided in this case would have to be in usable form. 4) The disclosure was appropriate because of the time and format it had been provided to the defence. The access to the documents was limited to the RCMP officer. The RCMP provided a copy of the officer's notes dealing with the investigation and matters ancillary thereto. The officer's notebook format was appropriate as well. The Office of the Crown Counsel requested that the documents be in a format that was reasonably accessible to the accused. The Court ordered that the RCMP supply the same documents in the same format to be utilized by the Crown and, in some situations, to the Defence in hard copies. The Laporte Inventory was named for the procedure in R. v. Laportes. 5) The use of hard copies (e.g. PDFs, CDs, audio files, and other files) was a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. The use and format provided to support the defence's argument that the accused's disclosure should have been in a meaningful fashion and that the disclosure material would be beneficial to the Court's ability to review the documents and to the officer in the position of assuming responsibility for the investigation.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to declare him a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The Crown had applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an Order remanding him for an Assessment. The Court found that the accused demonstrated such indifference to the officers and to the public that an order of this magnitude was warranted. The court found that given the accused's lengthy criminal record and the fact that he had been involved in several violent offences over a period of time, it would appear that the predicate offence of this offence is one which is prerequisite to ordering an assessment. The offender did not show such indifference. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by s.752. The threshold is low and the accused did not engage in conduct that would result in serious harm or severe psychological damage. The offences were violent and the impact on the officer was significant. The fact that the officer had a gun with a bullet in it and used it on the accused when he was cornered by the police and the officer fired his weapon at the accused and the police officer was struck by the officer. As the accused had committed violent offences and was in the process of breaking up a family, one of the factors that led to his convictions was his desire to kill his wife. The victim had a history of violent offences, including one where he had threatened to stab the officer in the face. The evidence showed that the offender had a serious psychological injury offence, which was the basis of his criminal record. The judge concluded that the prospect of the accused being found to be a dangerous or long-term offender was within the realm of possibility or beyond it. The order should not be made as the predicate offense is not a serious injury offence and it is not within the realms of possibility that the person who is convicted of this would be a person of interest under s.786(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of that Code. The crime was a'serious personal injury' offence as determined by the Court. The sentences were set out in R. v. Peters, 2009 SKQB 350 (CanLII). The Crown and the Crown had agreed that a penitentiary sentence was warranted given the serious nature of the offence, the level of risk of harm, the accused’s past behaviour and the court’d hope that deterrence would outweigh the risk of a dangerous and long"
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the certificate of analyses, which held the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) and s. 7(b)(iv) of the Charter of Rights to be acquitted. The respondent's waiver of rights under the Charter was not valid. The trial judge erred in finding that the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal advice. The Crown appealed. HELD: 1) The trial court found that the lack of Prosper warning did not mean that the Respondent gave an unconditional waiver. The Respondent had not rebutted the Crown's assertion that he had a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer once he changed mind and wished to contact one. The Court also found that in some circumstances a waiver of a right may be necessary to obtain legal advice, but the respondent failed to do so by failing to do it explicitly. The Certificate of Analysis was excluded. 2) The Respondents had not challenged the validity of the Crown’s waiver. 3) The respondent was found to have given an unequiv unequivocal and unequivocal verbal waiver. There was no breach of the Respondents’ rights under ss. 10 and 10(a) of The Charter. The police were required to tell the detainee of his right to reasonable opportunity and of the obligation on the part of the police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 4) The Crown was found not to have breached the respondent’ s. 9(b). 5) The Court noted that the failure of the RCMP to provide adequate assistance to the Respondant in changing his mind on the issue of whether he should have sought legal advice from a private lawyer was a factor to be considered. 6) The failure of police to provide sufficient assistance to a detainee in circumstances where there was no duty counsel available and where the detainee had not obtained the waiver was a serious concern. The failure to provide appropriate assistance to an accused who had changed his minds was a major factor to consider. The holding-off requirement was not applicable in this case. The receipt of the breathalyzer certificate was a direct result of the breach. 7) The police should not have been required to disclose the rights of a detainee to obtain advice. They were not required to inform the detainee that they had changed their mind. The certificate was excluded from the evidence. 8) The lack of a Prosper warning does not mean the Respondand gave an unambiguous waiver."

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until acquired from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the securityinterest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner ofthe vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of the car. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner access to the family home and supervised access only for the respondent father. The Court held that the evidence suggested that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it not in the best interests of the children and that their father had only supervised access to them. The respondent was to assume the role of primary caregiver. The court considered the allegations with care and caution. The magnitude of the latter harm far exceeded the probability adjusted risk of the harm the children might suffer if they were forced to suffer the loss of a normal relationship with a loving father. Therefore, the Court ordered the primary residence of the family and supervised supervised access for the father."

The Respondent takes steps to secure payment of their debenture by means of an application to this Court. The application to convert the application into an action is dismissed. The Court found that the application to be converted by way of an action was not appropriate and that the reasons for the delay in the application were various. The reasons for this delay are the application of the Respondents and the Court's concern that the Respondants may lose time in the enforcement process. In addition, the RespondENTS have commenced separate action for damages against the Respondant, Medusic. The actions they are taking will further diminish Medusa's ability to secure repayment of its debenturedures. The applications to be commenced in the meantime are being considered by the Court on a balance of probabilities."

Two health care institutions, one a residential and one a hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed.","This was an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the applicant. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. The appellant brought an application to quash the order setting off the vote to determine whether the two unions were appropriate. The Labour Relations board and chamber judge both focused on facts they found to be significant. The Chamber judge took a less rigorous and legalistic view of successor in s. 37 than that ultimately taken by the Labour Board. The Board's analysis and rejection of the evidence before the Board was based on more strict and rigorous definition of what constitutes successor employer under s.37. The Court of Appeal quashed the order for vote as premature. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Board was not prepared to limit itself to indicia of transfer of title or assets of nature which might be more pertinent in the context of, for example, financing arrangements, insurance contracts or other such matters. 2)The Chamber judge did not fail to address the fundamental question of whether the Board's interpretation of successor was patently unreasonable. 3)The test set out in the decision of the LRB was not patently unreasonably unreasonable. 4)The evidence before both the L&WB and the Chamber judge was not in dispute.

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The Court commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs claim. The parties exchanged the affidavits filed in support of their claims as well as their affidavit of documents and witnesses and the matter was set down for a simplified trial in May 2012. At that time, Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial. The Court ordered that the plaintiff should make herself available for cross-examination if the defendant wants to file her affidavit in support. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit. HELD: The simplified trial will continue in September.  1)It is clear that there is a case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. The court is not prepared to follow the decisions of other provinces but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation the Court made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. 2)The Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by counsel for the plaintiffs on September 5, 2012, that the Court accept the plaintiff's affidavit. If the plaintiff still wants to participate in the trial, she should make her presence known. If she still wants, the court will disregard her affidavit as well. 3)The simplified trial must continue on September5, 2012 in compliance with the provisions of Part 40."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the home in 1999. The realtor, who had recently purchased a new home, was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The parties agreed to a building permit for the home which was to be issued in 1999 and were to be operated by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park. The construction permit was never issued. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the home. The Court found that the defendants, who were not the realtor purchasers of the home, had breached the terms of the contract by failing to inform the plaintiff that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company. The defendant, STC, admitted to dismissing the plaintiff without cause or notice in breach of its contract of service with him. The plaintiff obtained a judgment for damages in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles (the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law. Was this error? Even if it were, and it was, not in substance at least, too much can be made of it. The severance terms of the plaintiff's contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service with the corporation.

d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by a judge who found that the warrant was invalid. The Crown alleged that the judge misapplied established legal principles in ordering the warrant to be quashed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court found that reasonable and probable grounds to obtain a search were created when there was evidence of a marijuana grow operation in the basement of the home and when the police were able to observe it from a distance. The evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and the result would not have been the same. The trial judge properly applied the test that establishes the existence of reasonable and likely grounds for obtaining a search: whether there is a reasonable and reasonable chance that the evidence obtained will lead to the arrest of the person who is charged with the offence; whether there was a breach of the Crown's and the JP's duty to protect the accused; whether the judge applied the proper standard of review and whether the evidence gathered was sufficiently probative to support the arrest and conviction; whether all of these factors constituted sufficient bases for the warrant; whether reasonable and possibly probable grounds could be drawn, but without the necessity of a review of the evidence, the court could not conclude that the search warrants could be issued.

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession for trafficking and the other charge was stayed. Brooks applied pursuant pursuant to S. 20(4) of The Controlled Drug & Substances Authority for an Order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln is not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed. The sentence imposed would be grossly disproportionate to the offence and the offender would be sentenced to a standard of punishment not available to the general public but to the extent that the offender received the punishment prescribed in s. 11 of the Charter. The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property was stated in R. v. Gisby. The offender deserves the punishment that is available to her. The criminal justice system does not allow the granting of a standard punishment, but rather an order of forfeiture, which is the standard for successful forfeiture applications. The administration of justice is served by the court applying the s. 20 provision of the act. The provisions of the Criminal Drug and Substance Act (CDSA) provide the court with the tools to obtain relief from forfeiture. The CDSA does so both through punishment and deterrence. The driver of the Lincoln was found innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offence and Brooks was found not guilty. The judge concluded that the standard of treatment available to offenders is not available in the context of s. 12 of the charter. The court concluded that it would be appropriate to grant the relief sought by the applicant in this application, but not in this case, that the relief was only available to an accused who had been convicted of the designated substances offence and who exercised all reasonable care to avoid punishment.

There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.",The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue was the child's status immediately prior to the accident. The respondent had indicated to the father that she had informed the father of the child. The father had since moved out of his parent's home and was now living with his mother. The evidence showed that the child had not withdrawn from the parent's charge at the time of the accident and was taking a hiatus from work to pursue post-secondary studies. The support was terminated by agreement with the consent order providing that the son would be in the father's custody for a period of time to further his education. The issues were not the issue of whether the child should have withdrawn or was unable to withdraw from the parents' charge at that time. The child had been a dependant child prior to this point and was doing well in his online courses.
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and that their action was inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15 and s7 of the charter and that they be reinstated as full-time members of the faculty of the respondent immediately and that the respondent pay all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest and costs.  This was an attempt to short-circuit the anticipated lengthy process under the Charter."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. The father takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. He seeks an interim order that he have custody of them. HELD: 1) The grandmother is a person of sufficient interest. She should have sufficient interest in the matter. 2) The issues must be determined. The first issue is whether the grandmother can show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the child. 3) The second issue is the nature of the relationship between the grandmother and the children. She must consider whether the applicant can show both a significant relationship with the child (e.g. with respect to medical care and counselling), how the relationship with other parties was represented to the world and whether the father provided financially for the children 4) The third party should have obtained an order for substitutional service on the grandmother."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act. The plaintiff argued that SGI had prior knowledge that he was suffering from depression and that he should seek treatment from an experienced physiotherapist. The defendant applied for an order setting aside the termination. Application for order setting off the termination dismissed. The deceased was a farmer and pursuant to the Act, received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he could not perform some farming duties. Following the accident, the plaintiff was forced to seek treatment at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton and was denied employment for a time. He argued that he had lost his ability to farm and that his injuries prevented him from continuing his farming operation. HELD: The plaintiff's benefits were terminated. The court found that under the terms of s. 185 it was not prepared to find that the deceased caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment in September. The Court found that SGE was not entitled to terminate the plaintiff' benefits pursuantto s. 184(d), (e), (f) or (g) of s185. Accordingly, pursuant to ss. 198(3)(a), the termination of the plaintiff’s benefits was set aside."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The application was opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor 2301042 Dominion Bank. The appellants wished to add as ground that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not alawful plaintiff and, therefore, not entitled to security for cost. The point raised by the appellant and the respondent in opposition to the amendment is for a panel and not a chambers judge to consider. The amendment will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He displayed a high profile contributor to a website during the time in question and argued that his writings were 'wishful fulfillment fantasies of what wish had done with those two girls when they were under my roof'. The defendant argued that he did not know such stories were unlawful in Canada and that he would benefit from one-on-one individual counselling by a professional person appropriately trained in sex offender treatment. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order of counselling through mental health services as directed to do so by the supervisor. 1)The defendant had no criminal record. He abided by release conditions over the past two and halfyears, had no previous criminal record, and was now serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lived on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. 2)The sentences imposed were significantly longer than the sentences set out in the Criminal code. The maximum sentence for distributing child porn was 15 months. The sentences were considerably shorter than the range set out for the offences of distributing childpornography. The fact that the defendant had given short written stories to a group of aboriginal men who were seeking out the youngest looking female to fulfil their sexual needs did not outweigh the other factors. 3)The sentence was considerably longer than what was imposed for the offence of distributing the child pornography. The offences were committed against an estimated age of 14 years. 4)The maximum sentence of incarceration was a term in the range of 12 months to 3 years. The sentencing guidelines were met."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The defendant was granted a summons to argue a portion of the 18 claims submitted by the plaintiff. The summons was refused on the grounds the plaintiff was not entitled to a summons. The plaintiff argued that the judge had failed to provide sufficient notice to the other potential defendants and had failed, in addition to failing to provide proper service on the Federal Crown. The defendant was ordered to return to court on September 16, 2011 for a hearing on the issues. The issues were decided on September 17, 2011. The return date for the summons was set two months later. The issue was whether or not the defendant should be issued a summons under s. 7(4) of The Small Claims Act. The applicant had submitted 18 claims for issuing. The judge had refused to issue a summons, and had then refused to provide notice to other potential claimants. The application for declaratory relief was not made in the meantime and the court was satisfied that the applicant had not demonstrated a clear understanding of the issues raised."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The application for relief from the respondent had been brought by the petitioner. HELD: Relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousal support. The petitioner had the means to pay $500 per month. The respondent was 52 years old and was unemployed. He had three sources of income: a CPP disability pension, Disability Insurance, and Pension for the children. HOLD: The respondent's monthly expenses were $595. There was another source of revenue and property which the petitioner had de facto possession of. The difference in value relates to a section of land which was rented out. The property value is $293,874. The 46 year old father who qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan was also granted $500. The court found that the petitioner and the children had the ability to pay the $500 monthly stipend. The fact that the respondent was unable to obtain a suitable shelter on his own was a deplorable condition."

The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15). The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries. As the applicant had not understood that evidence from another action could not be considered by the court on this application, the applicant was also required to file further affidavit evidence.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties were previously divorced and had been together for seven years. The petitioner now sought access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties had been married for seven months. The child had a brother and sister. The father had previously been convicted and incarcerated for sexually assaulting the complainant. The mother had recently moved out of the residence with the parties' two youngest children. The daughter had a close relationship with her biological father, who had provided care and attention to her for the past seven years (including one year in a new residence). The parties' relationship had spanned the years 2000 to 2007. The relationship spanned time when the mother was living with the father of the children and their two younger children. Although the father had been previously convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, the conditions attached to the sentence included a community based sentence. Access to the petitioner was not in the best interests of the child. The issues were as follows: 1) The petitioner had a near perfect relationship with the respondent. He provided care for her and provided support when the parties lived together. The respondent had two older half-siblings who he believed were his children. 2) The respondent demonstrated he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the child by proposing that the petitioner have access with him. The evidence showed that the respondent had a reasonable expectation that the child would have access to him. It was also clear that the relationship with his children had not been temporary. The court was concerned that access to the respondent would result in a negative impact on the child and the petitioner's relationship with them both. Access was not granted to the applicant because of the respondent's criminal record. The Court was concerned about the relationship between the parties’ two youngest child, who at the time of the relationship were in the mother’s house and not with the petitioner’ s mother. The applicant had a high threshold for access based on the circumstances of the situation. The access denied by the petitioner raises serious concerns about the petitioner. HELD: Access was denied. 1) Access was dismissed. The essence of the petitioner and the child’S best interests were in harmony with the home and with the principles of family law applicable to all persons. The fact that the applicant had not established that she was a step-parent and that access was denied to the appellant was enough to cause the action to be dismissed.  2) Access to this child was conditional on the petitioner establishing that she had a settled intention to bring this application to trial."

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The court found that the injuries were not serious enough to be consideredaggravated. The issues were as follows: 1) the accused's perception of the situation is subjective; the accused’s belief must be objectively reasonable on the basis of the situations that he perceives. 2) the Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Code. The Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt, subject to whether the defence of self- defence has application, that the attack on the victim constituted an aggravated assault within the meaning of the Criminal Code. 3) the court found it necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of the accused from the acts of other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries. The terms “aid” and “abet” refer to assist or assist and the accused believes on reasonable grounds that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm. 4) the Court found that in all of the circumstances the accused had established that bodily harm to the victim was objectively foreseeable by him as a result of the plot to which he was a party. The accused had been charged with common assault, but the Crown had not established that it was the accused who caused the injuries."

The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of his Breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District on the date in question with 'ride along'. He testified that the 'ridealong' had no duties and was simply with him. He chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. HELD: The accused was convicted of refusal to provide breath sample contrary to s 254(5) of The Code. 1)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5)(a)(c) consists of intentional non-compliance. 2)The accused testified that he did not intentionally try to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. The officer's cander in giving his evidence raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness. 3)The police officer did not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. The police officer's lack of cander was raised doubts as to forthright accuracy. 4)The court preferred the testimony of the accused over that of the officer where there was discrepancy. The court provided adequate instructions to the accused on what day the sample should be provided. The information provided by the police officer was adequate. 5)The Court provided adequate instruction to the officer as to how to provide an adequate breath sample and the appropriate instructions on how to give an adequate and adequate sample of the breath.

5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant."
