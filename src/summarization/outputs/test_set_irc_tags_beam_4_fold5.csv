The offences were premeditated, and directed against trusting and well-intentioned organizations. Sentencing the offender to four months consecutive imprisonment on each count, for a total of twenty months, and ordering restitution to the victims,  that the sentence must serve as a message of deterrence to all individuals who hold positions of trust and authority.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent’s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office and continued to date as Interest Registration No. 106597705. The notice of extension had expired on the expiry of 150 days from the date of its service on February 28, 2006. The limitation period had substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention and it expired within the day. The applicant was awarded the taxable costs of her application against the respondent."

Part of the order sought provided for the payment of solicitor fees by way of a contingency fee agreement negotiated with the applicant. The contingency fee agreement was never filed with the prothonotary. Granting the order relating to the settlement amount, but setting aside the contingency fee agreement, that Civil Procedure Rule 63.19(1) requires that all contingency fee agreements be filed with the prothonotary. As this was not done, the applicant's solicitor is only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of the contingency agreement.","The applicant sought approval of the Court for a settlement on behalf of the infant plaintiff. The issue before the Court was the amount of a Contingency Fee Agreement which the respondent had registered with the Prothonotary's Office as required. HELD: The Court approved the $17,000 settlement. The respondent was only entitled to compensation as would have been payable in the absence of any contingency arrangement and without regard to the contingency. The Court held that the money should be paid in installments rather than disbursements.

9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given that the presumption of care and control was rebutted, the trial judge next considered whether the accused had 'de facto control' as defined by Boudreault (2012 SKPC 129), [2012] SCR 157, and found that he did. 2) The trial judge found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the appellant did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as rebutting the statutory presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction, and raised numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds did the appellant take the position that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and was actively involved in the referendum process. He was a member of the Students' Union during the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. When faced with a result (rendered by procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, he simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and, secondly, with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the breathalyzer readings and the accused offered an innocent explanation for them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the trial judge found that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The accused's driving pattern may well have been combination of alcohol and a very hurting ankle but certainly some of the driving was result of his impairment. The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit.' The judge accepted that the accused's unsteadyiness could have been function of the hurt ankle. Consequently, the conditional stay becomes permanent and equivalent to an acquittal for both appeal purposes and autrefois acquit."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had not appealed. The issue on appeal was the interpretation adopted by the board of the word 'published' asused in s. 5(1)(b) of the Education and Health Tax Act. If, as the board found, the purchase of the documents was an independenttransaction, was it exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1(f)) of the Act? 1) The evidence before the board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase than documentation charges. 2) The respondent did not pay taxon what is referred to as Documentation charges. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which the book or technical paper is produced, distributed or available to sufficiently broad an audience. 3) On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. 4) The Court's role is supervisory in nature. Questions of law are within the purview of the Court. On a case of fact the Court is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact made by the Board. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 5) The appeal is allowed. The decision of Board reversed. 6) The appellant shall have costs of the appeal."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The court found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The trial judge did not refer to the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused and did not address the respondent's belief that he was being threatened; and the proportionality of his response. The appellant's mistake of fact was reasonable and he did not focus on the fact there were two officers present. It is not unreasonable for the appellant to believe that he is in imminent danger of death or grievous bodily harm and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable. However, the appeal judge did err in the ways he did in failing to consider the factors of the three witnesses."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the City was responsible for the discrimination against the applicant on the basis of his disability. CUPE had no claim to the right to be recalled into the position of permanent employee based on seniority. 2) The tribunal failed to take into account the applicant's disability. The fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy made his complaint within the Code's limitation period irrelevant. It was impossible for the applicant to gain employment with the City because of the entry-level position. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the Applicant. The tribunal was negligent in failing to find the City accommodated the Applicant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship. The Applicant's numerous attempts to gain permanent status were unsuccessful. His frustration with the city and its administration for failing to provide him with employment insurance heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after him, passing him on the seniority list. 3) The Applicant had no standing to challenge the tribunal on any issue."
9_2009nssc420.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use of a weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and breach of a recognizance.

When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused, who was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance related to alcohol and weapon possession, was given his Charter rights. He was asked if he understood his right to have counsel then and there, and his response was that he was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day. The police had been aware that he had returned to the porch some time after 6:00 p.m. and that he, too, was in a state of shock. He went to the hospital, where he was treated for a head injury, and was released by ambulance. During the course of his detention, the accused made several incoherent ramblings about Paul McCartney but then turned to the accused and said, 'Is he dead? He beat me so beat him back.' The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial and he did not understand his rights. His response created enough uncertainty for the court to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us'. It would be egregious to allow admission of the videotaped statement into evidence. There was a low threshold in the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive retroactive pay. The appellant had argued that the phrase 'any employer' referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the agreement. The arbitrator found the phrase to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded in his ratio that: 1) these competing aids to interpretation did not find an unambiguous one. The phrase referred to any employer in the context of the collective agreement, was an ambiguous one. However, the arbitrator used one of the appropriate and, indeed, first tools of statutory interpretation for an ambiguous phrase that is to interpret it in thecontext of the entire agreement. 2) The appeal was dismissed (orally) with the exception of the patently unreasonable error of law which was not a legal analysis but a fact of fact. 3) The entire agreement was subject to the Arbitrator's analysis and interpretation, and the phrase in question was ambiguous. It could have been any combination of tools, extrinsic evidence and the onus would have been a sufficient ratio to support his conclusion he was in error and patently unreasonably error. 4) The Arbitrator was unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history."

The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

4_1994canlii5226.txt,"The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. Matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. The university pension of the former wife was divided as follows: (a) the share vested in the applicant was not now in any way under the control of the applicant; (b) the university was to make monthly pension payments directly from the pension plan to the applicant. Whether this was converted to a lump sum payment or continues as monthly payments is exclusively the concern of the University of Regina and the applicant HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The court preferred to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order and consequential declarations and directions. Paragraph 14(a) provides that the applicant is to receive 'a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in this order' which is the sum of $2,314.69 or 60% of the total pension payable. 2) The order of December 19, 1985 does not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly, the 40% share, having vested in JeanZacharuk, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, Russell. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care, which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the appellant had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The husband reported the problem to the Agency, which sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The appellant sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Rule 1.04 of the Family Court Rules. Dismissing the application without costs, that the procedure adopted is an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her present circumstances. If the court is wrong in that regard, the court cannot find it is in S.'s best interest to issue a retroactive custody order under the Family Maintenance Act."
b_2001canlii2619.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","A 21 year old friend of the accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death after she observed a white vehicle go over the centre line of the highway by a few inches for approximately 20 seconds. The accused was later found to be the operator of the vehicle. Viva voce evidence was heard at that time regarding the contact point between the driver's vehicle and the oncoming vehicle. HELD: The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the person's ability to operate motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drugs.  1)It was assumed that the white vehicle was not speeding but it was coming into collision with oncoming traffic travelling in the proper lane and thus causing an accident. 2)The blood alcohol reading taken from the victim was accurately recorded as 216 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which was within the range of background interference for the test equipment.  3)Although the accused's condition may have affected her ability to drive, the initial reading of her blood alcohol level at 12:10 p.m. was accurate, as was the extrapolation of that reading back to the time of the operation of the motor vehicle in the same day.  4)The accused was found to have been inebriated. 5)The Court rejected the defence's submission that the hospital laboratory analysis was derived from blood serum rather than whole blood as there was no evidence at trial to prove the fact assumed.  6)The evidence did not support the admission of the expert's opinion as to the blood alcohol concentration in the victim's body."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the defendant, who did not appear at trial and entered a defence in defence of the allegations in the statement of claim. The issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1993 until February 11, 1994. HELD: The plaintiff's claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against the defendant was not proven and the portion of the claim dismissed. The defendant, Hyndman, was awarded taxable costs.  1)It was clear from the defendant's notes and the evidence at trial that there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that the plaintiff might not be paid on the leases. 2)The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff in an attempt to keep the company operational were taken for the benefit of the company. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor the plaintiff benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money. The facts of this case did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  3)Costs. Although there was no specific contract regarding the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard in respect to some work orders that were issued by Redhead. Both parties were responsible for ensuring that the vehicles were operational. Both companies benefited.  4)The only evidence was that the payments by the defendant for work related to the repairs were made either under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where a specific purchase order number was supplied by Hyno. The plaintiff was prepared to assume that risk.  5)There was no evidence of a breach of contract between the parties. There was no discussion about the contractual terms of the lease. No verbal agreement was made. It is clear from Cox's notes that the discussions covered the idea that the repairs would continue for as long as the trucks were in the possession of Standard or operating under the authority of the insurer. The evidence indicates that there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors of the payment of these accounts. In addition, all of the invoices marked unpaid and claimed at trial continued to be sent to the address for Standard at 417 Maxwell Crescent in Regina and there was evidence that these accounts were forwarded to the defendant.  6)The defendant was"
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal and damages for breach of contract and insubordination. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He was awarded his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year as a guidance counsellor. He taught upgrading and university entrance courses and supervised other teaching and support staff. His employment was terminated in the summer of 1996 when he was terminated by the chief and band council. He remained in that position until May 1997, at which time he was reinstated. His damages were limited to $12,394.22 and he was awarded pre-judgment interest on that amount. 2)There was no evidence that some members of the board created an environment that made it impossible for the plaintiff to perform his duties to their satisfaction. It was as though they were determined to see him gone and set about to find a way that he could not.  He was treated unfairly and wrongfully dismissed."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running a mixed grain and cattle operation. They have not settled a division of the matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is $29,983 and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn Knudson, born December 1998; in 2004, there will be added back income in the amount of $10,000 for non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The Court is not prepared to add back to income in any of the three years the capital cost allowance is payable.  2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital Cost allowance on personal property owned in the partnership. The analysis of add-back becomes appropriate only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the overpayment has been extinguished. 3) The Court will deal with the individual amounts on a year-by-year basis. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is one of those files where it appeared that the holding of trial, in fact, was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There was nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to conclude that the Capital Cost Allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed, that any expenses or accounting functions used by partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. Therefore, the Court was unable to find that the respondent has been making maintenance payments at an appropriate level for three years. The adjustment can be made at this time."

In admitting into evidence a statement by the appellant to an RCMP constable without holding a voir dire, the judge agreed with Crown's submission that the conversation should not be admitted into evidence because of an alleged inducement. The RCMP had advised the appellant of several places that they should look for stolen lobsters based on information received from the appellant. The appellant advised the constable of axes used in the commission of the offence and told the officers that crates were in the ocean near the scene. The constable made notes of a conversation he had with the appellant respecting some of the circumstances surrounding the offence. The trial judge in effect permitted into evidence what he previously said he would not allow: the conversation between the appellant and the appellant without a voirs dire.

1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing byBawolin, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawol as he now says, at the time of the contempt. Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the trial judge on the matter of costs. 3)The judge might conclude that once the whole story is revealed, that the legal costs incurred to enforce production are out of proportion to any gain Siemens could have expected to achieve in the years since Siemens' acquisition of the company. 4)The court was satisfied that the defendant's contempt for the plaintiff arises from the sorry state of his records. The contempt has been purged sufficiently to permit the Court to withdraw from further intervention. Proper identification of assets has resulted largely through production orders against third parties, but also, through belated efforts by the defendant. Additional information demanded by Siemens can be obtained through the normal discovery process.  5)Solicitor and client costs to be taxed. 1)Immediately after the third party order was sought, there appeared to be an urgent need to preserve the plaintiff's property.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning the applicants' physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Department of Corrections declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by the applicants is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus and these remedies fall outside the Exclusive jurisdiction of The Federal Court through a review process such as judicial review. 3) In the unique circumstances of this case, with the consent of both parties and the respondent not really taking issue with the applicant's request, the Court allowed the applicants to make submissions to the Court on their behalf as well as his own. That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument the applicant had to be assisted by court official for blood sugar related situation that had culminated in the application. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants's situations have changed."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; in dealing with maintenance under the Divorce Act; the wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so that she could retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of the net proceeds if it were to be sold in the future; the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconscionable and harsh to bind the wife to such a agreement. Both parties acknowledge that there are no factors that have been established under s 13 of the Act to warrant the creation of a division such as this; in fact there is no reference to independent legal advice in our statute. A divorce judgment is granted based on the finding that there was no possibility of a reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing. The wife's application for a share in the value of her Matrimonial Home (net equity) was dismissed. Husband and wife separation agreement set aside; maintenance to be increased in the amount of $1,000 per month; wife to pay monthly maintenance of $600; husband to pay child support of $800 per month until age 65; if the courts are not prepared to enforce the maintenance provisions of the contract they will make an order varying the terms of the agreement as the court sees fit."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable the issue will finally put an End to the Action.  1)The judge must be able to assess the conflicting opinions of the accident reconstruction experts as to how the accident itself occurred. Such evidence will be required to establish the origin and cause of the causation of the injuries. Such a determination will necessitate a re-examining of injuries and the evidence to be heard will be easily segregated and will not require repetition of the evidence. 2)A jury, after discharge, cannot be reconstituted. There was no evidence that such a jury could be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial.  3)The plaintiff was not to be harassed at the instance of the defendant by series of trials, each trial taking issue on every link of the plaintiff's case. That is not the meaning of the rule as understand it, but it may properly be applied in such case as that have stated, where the judge has serious reason to believe the trial will end the action and cannot afford to delay it. 4)No jury, whether discharged or not, can be returned to carryon with the first part of a trial. The injuries sustained by the plaintiff are consistent with the causal relationship between the injuries sustained and the causal effect of the collision."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children, with the primary responsibility being to pay child support based on the difference between what the husband would normally pay to the wife and what she would otherwise pay for the children's support. The former wife operated her own business and earned negligible income. She asked the court to review the amount of child support paid by the husband, arguing that she was limited in what she could do due to an injury she suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident in November 2004. She sought to have the payments based on her RRSP income, which was a recurring income figure over the past four years, including 2008, be deducted as an adjustment pursuant to the Child Support Guidelines, and to have spousal support paid back to the date of the last order effective on any date before that date. The previous variation order was a consent order. Both parties agreed to its terms and both parties had legal advice prior to agreeing to it. The order was approved by the court and was not appealed.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and possession of fish except in accordance with s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within s. 27 of The Act. The fact that the accused was prohibited from obtaining a fishing licence at the relevant times and from applying for or obtaining a licence by mistake did not disqualify him from applying. The Act does not give the accused the power to revoke or revoke the licence. Exhibit P1 is not a document valid on its face. It purports to revoke Mr. Paulsen’s licence and prohibit him from apply for or obtain a licence because of a specific conviction. It is signed by an unknown person. This is not collateral attack on a ministerial order, valid on it face. Nor was he served by registered mail, in which case it would take effect on the delivery date or on the date the signed post office receipt is returned to the sender."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge did not consider the definition of a weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. HELD: Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed but that it was weapon as defined in the Code 2.0. That is question for the trial judge, considering all the circumstances. 2)The Court disagreed with the argument that there was no inference of the appellant's intent in having the concealed push dagger on his person might be drawn. It would be inappropriate to enter an acquittal. 3)The sentence imposed was, in fact, fit."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti, in January 2007. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for variation of child support in September 2006. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The mother's poor treatment and disdain of the father and his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with him misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.  2) The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has been set at 1)."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide, on 'call out', repair services for Super Save. In the relationship, the defendant paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged to its detriment. The defendant properly points out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared, and that it has therefore incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 2) The plaintiff has received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought, but the defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money sought. The plaintiff asks that the court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonably price for goods. 3) There is no evidence of detriment reliance. The law demands, that in the absence of an express term in a contract, or an implied term that the parties agreed to charge a fair or reasonable price for those goods and/or services, the parties agree to charge and pay a fair/reasonable price. There is only an assertion which has been denied by the defendant."" 4) It is clear that prior to November of 2015 the parties did not take issue with the invoicing. Some of the parties have given evidence that this is precisely because the defendant thought the prices were within the confines of the agreement that it signed off on. The Court cannot attribute the discounted price to the plaintiff. It would be unfair and unjust to allow the plaintiff, as it did in the first instance, to charge anything that is in excess of the amount it should have been charged, and in turn to deny the plaintiff that it is entitled to the quantum of damages it seeks."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during road work which had caused extensive damage to her property. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court. The applicant submitted that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. Application granted; the defendant had 90 days to file its defence. Although the Court could order otherwise, find the position of the defendant met the test for the Court to strike the default judgement under the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 12.06; and find the defendant did not have the jurisdiction to sign the order for default judgment. The default judgment should be set aside based on Rule 3.04 and the plaintiff was entitled to her costs of obtaining the default."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy under s.172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. His assets were $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. His statement of affairs showed that he had $50,000 in assets at the time of his assignment, but that amount was reduced to $8,000 as a result of the combined forces of drought and BSE. The bankrupt argued that he purchased cattle for $1,000 per head prior to bankruptcy but could only sell them at his expense. He alleged that he sold cattle post-bankruptcy to save his farm. SCU brought an application to compel the bankrupt to consent to judgment on s.173(1)(a) and sought payment of the cost award of $12,000 coupled with a conditional order of consent of half of their judgment. The bankruptcy judge did not report on this ground and the bankrupt's demeanour was much the same as that of a bankrupt. HELD: The bankrupt's discharge was granted conditional upon payment of $10,250 composed of $2,250 for surplus income and a further $800 for payment to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. The Court found that this ground had been met and that the bankrupt should be able to comply with it within three years which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with such a condition. There was no question that his assets were less than.50 cents on the dollar when he commenced farming in 2001 and they had increased over the years. This ground was substantiated by SCU's expert evidence that showed the bankrupt was prone to errors in law and had made poor decisions in his farming operation but had made the right decisions in the right circumstances."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary. He must have found one-half (i.e., five) of these extracurricular activities were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 2) The appellant appeals only this aspect of the fiat, arguing that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the costs associated with the children's activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses'. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73% of Ashley's Tae Kwon Do and soccer costs, Mitchell's soccer costs and Makayla's voice and soccer. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not 'prepared to make the agreement retroactive'. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The employer was a merchant. His products are priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. 2) The Board denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. 3) The importance of a wage rise, retroactive and to a point where a rehearing would seem counter productive. 4) It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. 5) To be patently unreasonable it must be clearly irrational, absurd, ridiculous so beyond the bounds of reason as to amount to a fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it. The Court found that the motion failed."
d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA prohibition order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIra compliance order which is mandatory in these circumstances. 1)The Court of Appeal reviewed the relevant case law and found the accused guilty of all four charges and that his order must be set aside and replaced by one of a lifetime quota compliance order for sexually assault offences. 2)The trial judge in Provincial Court agreed with the Crown appeal that the accused complied with the terms of the sentencing order but did not agree with the trial judge's interpretation of the second amendment to the Sex offender Registration Act."
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, [HELD:]. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that, in addition to the usual fines of $500,000, the sentence was also demonstrably unfit. It was not an error of law that the convictions were so harsh as to be disproportionate to the offence committed; given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, this sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' to be imposed. Oppositely, it was both appropriate and fit."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. 2) The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour for a six-week period averaging 34.25 hours. The average work week was 34.75 hours. 3) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB set the respondent's gross yearly employment income at the time of the accident is much lower than that used for employment insurance benefits. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which it is derived. 4) The issue is determining the time that Montgrand would have actually been employed and that finding has been made."
6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the child have been resolved. The child is the biological son of the parties. He was born July 31, 1996 and lived with the mother until 2006, when he started living with the father again. The mother now sought child support for him from the father. This is an important decision. The threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in a substantial substitution for that of a natural parent. This was not the case in Chartier v. Chartier (1999) Carswell Man 25 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the issue.

The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On August 16, 2006, six days shy of the two year limitation period, the plaintiffs claimed that DDH, the female plaintiff had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. HELD: The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery. The defendants may require their own medical examinations by request to the plaintiff or court.  1) There is substantive and legitimate purpose served by the defendants' request for better and current particulars and disclosure of documents. 2) The defendants must know with more particularly, garnered from the passage of time and therapeutic treatment and healing of the plaintiff, the extent of her injury and whether there will be chronic disability the extent to which the plaintiff has not yet fully recovered for her injuries. There may be other reasons as to why the plaintiffs need more particulars in order to prepare for discovery.  3) The plaintiffs need to tap into the legitimate resources available to them. The medical opinions of the leading experts in their field are meaningful and can be interpreted to mean that they can assist in the discovery process. To be able to assist in that meaningful and meaningful way, they need more than just a request for particulars. These experts may also be of assistance to the plaintiffs in making further discoveries. These are real and meaningful resources that can be used to advance the defence. To tap into those resources is a legitimate and legitimate application."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.",The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent father pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether s. 7 expenses met the requirements set out in The Family Maintenance Act; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements for retroactive child support. The respondent father's contribution to the child's school expenses should be 59% being his proportionate share; and 4) if the respondent child continued to have independent needs he should pay his 59% share of those expenses within 10 days of receiving them.

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. Deloitte & Touche applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the applicant trustee to sell it. The mortgagee, HSBC Bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the real property. Notice of this application was served upon counsel for the registered owner and no opposition on its part has been taken to this application. The application for the vesting orders applied for is granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue. Because the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, R.R.S. 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c. L-5.1, and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vestings orders, the jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of The Land Titlestles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new regulations. Rather, the court has reintroduced the provisions of s. 7 of the Act, which encumbrances, competing creditors, and the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected if the order is granted as there were no prior encumbrance, competing creditor, or survivor of the interest in the common equity rights (there was none) were adversely affected."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were to be in joint custody of the children. Their access to the matrimonial home was largely divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. Their desire to eventually relocate to Alberta to marry a speech language pathologist had resulted in the children residing an equal amount of time in each parent's home. Although their relationship was strained and they suffered from a lack of structure and support in their educational endeavours, the children were doing well in their father's home and it was in their best interests to remain in that home. The uncontradicted evidence of the mother indicated that the most important consideration for the children now was stability. That stability was found in their home and they received the most structured and support system in the province. The evidence showed that the move to Clareshorn, six hours drive from Saskatoon would have a significant impact on the children's quality of contract."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The deceased was employed at a grain terminal near Rosetown, Saskatchewan. He entered a grain receiving pit in the terminal, where he was engulfed in grain and died of suffocation. Viterra is charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure the health and safety of every person employed by it, including the deceased, was protected. The Court of Appeal does not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the Health and Safety of an employee. HELD: The deceased was not charged with any of the counts except for the one concerning the deceased. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the deceased had not yet received hands-on training in confined space did not directly affect the accuracy of the deceased's evidence. The deceased's death does not necessarily mean that the appellant failed to provide due care and diligence to the employee.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, who were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The motor vehicle accident occurred in October 1998 and both Johansson and Johansson were paid their damages as result of the releases given to Citadel General Assurance Company (Citadel). Both parties brought a Statement of Claim on behalf of all three plaintiffs alleging that the motor Vehicle accident was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being used by the plaintiff. Both conditions were satisfied and the plaintiff was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel.

1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part.  1)The applicants spoke of the public interest, it appears to be intimately entwined with their personal self-interest. 2)The Town Council took certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. They held a tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. 3)In each instance the fact of the 'in camera' meeting was recorded and the Council's consequent action was made part of the Public Record. 4)There was a specific complaint of unfair advantage or discrimination by reason of the fact that the proposed hotel would be connected to the EverGreen Centre. The authorities were clear that the onus of proving these allegations rests upon the applicant. 5)Had the respondent met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting? The applicants were aggrieved that the Town Council conducted further business on May 25 and June 14, 1999 after the applicants had departed. It was the practice of the council to move to the Committee-of-the-Whole and then return to open session to complete its business. 6)The applicant sought to have the status quo declared null and void.  7)A public hearing was held on July 12, 1999 at which the applicants were excused from the council meeting and then returned to the meeting. The issues to be determined were: (a)whether the proceedings in respect to this proposed hotel was in the public best interest; (b)whether there was a breach of contract between the applicant and the developer; and (c)whether it was necessary for the applicant to obtain a deposit in trust in order to carry on negotiations with the developers on the proposed walkway.  8)The respondents were responsible for all legal, survey and service costs to the applicant, including legal and survey costs; and(b)to make a presentation for a new business venture in out (sic) town which will involve an existing public facility.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court's standard of review is that of whether s. 36 is justiciable per se, or whether the appellant's allegations against the government have merit. In this case, the claim must survive unless the court makes a finding that the government has breached its constitutional commitment to properly distribute this federal funding. The Court reviewed the applicable legal principles surrounding applications to strike and the heavy burden faced by the appellant as an applicant for an order to strike."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of fixed commission between the parties. The plaintiff retained a lawyer to help with the legal issues of the project. In the absence of an enforceable agreement, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was granted. The court was satisfied someone was honestly in error. 1)There was no oral agreement. If there was, it was enforceable but in the alternative an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. 2)The plaintiff carries on business as a licensed real estate broker with an office in Lunenburg. He is retired heart surgeon and resides with his wife. His company began to build a reputation for innovative ideas. 3)The commission is 10% commission inclusive of project management, with the provision that if at any time you were not satisfied with the project, the fee would be 10% of the total sales. 4)The court was required to determine the appropriate amount of costs."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan"

A reasonable cause of action is disclosed. 2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made.

The application is brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action as the case may be; (c) it is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and may otherwise be an abuse of process; (d) the plaintiff must be afforded an opportunity to establish that. The statements made by the defendant, May Henderson, were malicious, highhanded and calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his profession, calling and trade carried on by him at the time they were made and to undermine his intention to seek an elected position as a member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff will have his costs fixed at $400 in any event of the cause. 1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant all the essential elements of a claim in defamatory are set out. That being so, a reasonable Cause of action is disclosed and the quoted test has not been met. 2) The plaintiff must establish that the words spoken or written were published on lawful occasion, that is one 'fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency' such that there must be some mutuality of interest or duty between the publisher and recipient. This must be reciprocal of interest. It must not involve the satisfaction of some duty or interest which is unlawful or contrary to the public interest. The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant. 3) There may be merit to the defendant's claim but it cannot be dealt with in this application. While several affidavits were filed, none of them speak to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the plaintiff that the remarks were received in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty. The Plaintiff fails to plead any facts as to the dates on which these statements were made thus depriving the Plaintiff of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. The statement of claim alleges malice. It cannot be said that she fits within a situation like that in the Mitchell case."

Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other young men who joined the attack on the accused were also sentenced to probation. In this sentence, the Court imposed a two-year probation order. The Court also imposed a 10 year prohibition from possessing firearms following his release. The accused appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found that the accused was at a crossroads. He had some talent and some motivation to become a productive member of the community. 2)Pursuant to the principles of sentencing in crimes of violence, deterrence of the public was given the greatest emphasis. 3)The accused had a record of high levels of education and had been shunned by his peers and gang members for his poor grades. This was a case where it was clear that he had little chance of reintegration into society."
6_1993canlii4548.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","The plaintiff, Sign-O-Lite, sought damages for breach of contract of a written contract between the parties. The defendant, Nova, counterclaimed for damages based on negligent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff. The defendants argued that the contract should be interpreted in a 'purposive' manner to give effect to the intention of the parties, notwithstanding that the 6' 15' sign was not strong enough to act as a free-standing sign. Nova refused to pay the plaintiff the sum of $875.00 per month, plus any provincial sales tax, less any deductions and copious amounts of monies paid. The alternative claim was that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment since it supplied a sign which had been used for the benefit of the defendants since May 1987. Dismissing the counterclaim without costs, that the evidence showed that the defendants did not misrepresentation."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonet and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) and (16).Gari's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPPA. HELD: The appeal was allowed. It was common ground that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal evidence that the building had been sold to a third party in the spring and was not removed from the property until the fall resulted in a determination that the Building was not properly removed. The plaintiff had not established its claim for damages until it had paid rent and received a security deposit. The court found that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to removal the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail.  1) The trial court reviewed the relevant statutes and found that s.36 of the Act does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. 2) The analysis of the positions of the parties must proceed on that same basis, i.e. on the same basis that, as of September 1, 2017, the building was removed, the site returned to its original state and the $3,500 security deposit returned to Gari. Gari paid a total of $6,227.88 in property taxes during the time period when it says the Building remained on the Property after it should have been removed. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town. 3) The Court reviewed the circumstances and found there was no evidence that Lakeland intended to seize the building unless it paid a specified amount for disposal. It did not establish that the"
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown argues that the learned trial judge relied on irrelevant evidence and failed to consider other more relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.  1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The appellant's driving actions, including the illegal U-turn, were found to be in violation of s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights. 2) The evidence from the arresting officer and the breathalyzer technician on the scene suggested that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that, in fact, he was impaired by alcohol. The officer testified that he had walked slowly but without stumbling and was unable to locate his documentation in the truck. The accused sat in his vehicle with the door open and his left leg out while he unsuccessfully searched for his driver's licence and registration. This is not a position from which swaying would normally be observed. The court found that these otherwise normal driving actions do not negate the otherwise illegal driving, being the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial and an order for a new trial. During the trial, defence counsel disclosed to the court that the Crown had obtained instructions to allow them to continue reviewing the documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day because of the complexity of the documents, the number of documents available, the time it would take for the Crown to review the documents and, importantly, the disclosure of some of the previously disclosed documents. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the appropriate remedy to address the late and non-disclosure issue was to set aside the trial outright and allow the documents to remain undisclosed. As the court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that we are not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle. The plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred because the defendant's headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection. The defendant testified that he had just finished a police call in Cherry Brook and he had been requested by attending police officers to undergo breathalyser. The plaintiff also testified that she had had two White Russians during the evening that she thought were inoperatives of the vehicle's lights. At issue was whether the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. A.M.P. Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, Section 2, Section 3, Section 4, Section 5, Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 of the Traffic Accident Investigation Manual. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1) The evidence of the accident reconstructionist convinced the defendant he was not qualified to express an opinion. The evidence from the plaintiff's lawyer convinced him that the defendant gave detailed evidence of where he was on the highway and finite details as to his speed at those locations. He found that evidence unrealistic. 2) The plaintiff did not see the police vehicle approaching the intersection when it turned right in front of her vehicle. There was a lapse of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 minutes between the time she heard the screech of tires until she reached the officer's vehicle.  3) The defendant was found to be contributory to the accident and the plaintiff is entitled to recover the damages she suffered."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife had been left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to the judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.00. The husband was given one-half of the matrimonial home valued at $8,358.00 and an accrual to a Standard Life policy during the same period of $2,200 for $890.00 plus an additional $4,445.00 for the home. The father was to claim an exemption for his own house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' property. Such a division would mean that the father was being given one half of the only asset the wife had during the marriage and he was to have to assume a large mortgage or move out of his modest $60,000 home or to a rental accommodation. Both parties had the benefit of the home during their marriage. The wife had no savings, no pension and had little financial problems. She was to be awarded the $25,000 or so that she claimed against the home under the Act. Although the wife's claim was inequitable and had she not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from his employment without notice in 1988 for his 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a fifteen minute break for breakfast and an unpaid supper break for lunch. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to comply with company policy regarding breaks and overtime. Awarding the plaintiff $15.00 for an hour of work over an eight hour period, that day's break was $5.00 less an hour than normal and included breaks of 15 and 40 minutes. The plaintiff contended that his breaks were for his meal and he was awarded a $3.00 supper allowance. Dismissing the claim, that there was no reasonable excuse for the dismissal of the plaintiff. It was apparent from the evidence that the drivers and helpers had broken the rules by making the commutes to and from the warehouse, even though they were not paid at the time they were working. The fact that the breaks were often longer than they should have been and the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. On the evidence, the plaintiff testified that he stopped in at the Seabreeze Inn on most Thursdays when he did the Hubbards run and claimed overtime for the time he spent there. At his corrective interview in September, 1988, the driver and his helper were each given a 15 minute break in the morning and forty-five minute break during the afternoon. They claimed that they were entitled to breaks for lunch and that they had been given extra breaks for their breaks on the nights they were in the warehouse. As the plaintiff had not followed the company's rules, he was dismissed without notice. He claimed that his break was excessive and that he should have taken more breaks during the day. He also claimed that extra breaks were not included in his calculation for lunch break time. The only reasonable explanation given by the plaintiff was that he had been told by his supervisors that these breaks were part of his job. The Court did not find that reasonable explanation for his dismissal. On appeal the Court found that the defendant had satisfied the onus on the plaintiff to prove there was a just cause for him dismissal."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The estate applied for solicitor and client costs out of the estate. The father sought party and party costs. The issues were not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the implied promise against revocation, which his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. The issue was whether the father was required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of a condominium to his son. The central issue in the father's application was not about his father's Will but about his mother. It involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the Estate and the wills he drafted. Considering the present position of the father and his daughter, the three parties will bear their own costs. HELD: The representatives of the estates should be entitled to recover their solicitor, client and sues from the estate pursuant to the general practice and two principles.  1) The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to a client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. 2) In light of the present situation and the family's determination not to order costs against the father, those three parties WILL bear their costs.  3) It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved a question about the value of the property, the question about its value, its use and the manner in which it was presented to the deceased. There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of Mrs Hand's estate to provide an accounting. That was resolved only as the hearing began.  4) In respect to the father the estate will bear its own costs in light of this present position. The deceased clearly made a gift to him that failed. The possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the deceased before she executed the will. However, the issue was not between the father (who was represented in his personal claim by the father) and the deceased (who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting). The purpose is to give the successful a partial amount of indemnity from legal fees. Alternatively, the parties will pay their costs in their own capacity."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The plaintiff took four years post-graduate course in Illinois and received a Master of Science in 1984. In 1984, he started work at the University of Saskatchewan as an assistant professor. He received his full professorship in 1991. He was appointed director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in 2002. During the long weekend, the part of the hospital was closed to the public. During and after the renovation to the building, the plaintiff kept a log of his work log from May 2005 to January 2006. It appears that the notice was posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and by posting on the CUPE website. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. The privilege extends to all communications made by high executive officers acting in the performance of their official duties relating to matters of state, such as the creation of a grievance procedure or an arbitration procedure. Counsel for the plaintiff is awarded costs. 1) The Court accepts the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 2) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. The words of the grievance were found to be highly impugned in the sense that they would tend to lower the plaintiff’s reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person and to the words in fact referred to the plaintiff. It is not necessary for the tribunal to have all the powers of an ordinary Court. The tort is one of strict liability. Jurisdiction is one in which strict liability prevails. The court found that the plaintiff had not only refused to prevent the harassment but had been an active participant and contributor to the harassment himself. 3) The plaintiff was found to have been defamed by the wording of the respondent in his grievance. The respondent was found not to have acted in a negligent or intentional manner in failing to prevent or to seek the assistance of the defendants in this matter. The claim was dismissed with costs. 4) The court accepted the defendants’ defence in qualified privilege on the basis that the respondent had not established jurisdiction as required by s. 16 of the Trade Union Act. The Court found that jurisdiction is not the only determinative factor in determining whether a claim has been made pursuant to s. 21 of the Act. It was also found in the Court of Appeal that jurisdiction does not lie with the respondent."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was driving a motor vehicle that was operating in the manner dangerous to the public. The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive a vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his consumption of alcohol appeared to be a contributing factor. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. 1)A sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and would be consistent with the principles of general deterrence, specific deterrence, denunciation, and rehabilitation. 2)The accused was prohibited from driving for 15 months. 3)Electronic monitoring would not maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.  4)The Court of Appeal was of the view that a conditional sentence would not be appropriate."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants asked that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and sought an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 215(1) for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages and the issue of damages to be determined. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertained to the plaintiffs and the defendants' claim against them and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. The entitlement to sue for the disgorgement of profits hinges on whether Wolff, as its former employee, was in a position of fiduciary. The documents seized under the Anton Piller order had provided full disclosure to the plaintiff, and the plaintiffs would not seek any further order to restrain the defendants from competing with them. There was no evidence of breach of contract or improper interference by the defendants. The plaintiff's application to strike these portions of the claim was dismissed.  1)The defendants had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This joint venture required confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain their confidentiality. 2)The plaintiff was not disadvantaged in her claim by allowing the defendants to withhold their work product at this stage because the plaintiffs already had an immediate remedy should the defendants poach their clients. It follows that the plaintiffs can easily discern if the defendants are breaching that order. No breach has been alleged."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court testified that it was common for persons accessing the centralized server model to access the same server, same Internet address, and obtain the same information from the same physical location. In contrast, the peer to peer system is much different set up. It would contact a network that would contact other peers, people that had files that they might want and they could share files from many different sources. The software can't put those pieces together. The result is that if two people, in the same house downloaded Shareaza on their separate computers, they would have different G.U.I.D. numbers on their installation. The court was satisfied that the accused had a very good understanding of how computers work. The first issue on appeal was whether the accused, who was at the residence following a night shift, could have changed his address so that he could access the address of the person he wanted to contact. HELD: The Court granted the application for a search warrant and authorized the search of the entire duplex located within the RCMP campground. There were three computers seized. One computer had three hard drives, three of which were non-password protected. Examination of his computer did not yield any child pornography. The second computer, which was a laptop computer, had been tampered with so that it could not be accessed without a password. The third computer, a desktop computer, and an external hard drive were all seized. During the course of the search, the accused was subject to numerous requests for change of his IP address. During his investigation, the Court was also required to determine the physical address and name of the subscriber because two hours later that would be when the search warrant was executed."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. Following separation, the petitioner was making mortgage payments and paying utilities. In May 2012, he advised she would no longer contribute to the mortgage payment and would be reducing the child support payments to $926. He also indicated that he would reduce his utility payments. The respondent brought a motion returnable October 19, 2012 claiming child and spousal support together with exclusive possession of the family home. HELD: 1) The parties shall have joint custody of the children pursuant to a shared parenting arrangement. The parties agree that all outstanding issues are resolved at the settlement meeting. 2) The respondent seeks an order for interim exclusive possession (SSAG). The petitioner does not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggests it should terminate June 27, 2013. There is a need and ability to pay.  3) The Court reviewed the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant applied for damages in a jury trial for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The trial judge awarded damages in the amount of $409,251.18. The defendant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)Since liability was admitted by the defendant the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. 2)The evidence of the past loss of income was so inordinately high that it is perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 3)The plaintiff was not seeking to avoid the presentation of argument through the mouth of this witness and to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries. She was on the evidence far from being totally disabled. Accordingly, she would not be able to continue to provide useful service as a nurse."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence. The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","The young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault claimed that the Youth Court judge erred in law in concluding that the statements taken from him by the R.C.M.P. in March 1992 were voluntary statements. He appealed the convictions on two of the charges and a new trial was ordered on the basis that if the statements were not admissible, the Crown would have failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they were voluntary. The failure by the trial judge to make any finding with respect to this issue was a palpable and overriding error. The statement given to police officer was only admissible if it is a voluntary statement."
e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.","The owner of a single family home applied for a variance to convert the existing use to a two unit dwelling so that it could have two units without changing the side yard requirements. The proposal failed and the owner was imprisoned for 10 days. The owner appealed the order and sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the court in the amount of $25,000. The fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution and the plaintiff was entitled to proceed with the taxation of its costs and disbursements. 1)The dwelling was in contravention of the Halifax Regional Municipality's Land Use By-laws. The Court found that the owner had intentionally failed to comply with the order by failing to disclose certain provisions of the Order. 2)The inspection revealed that the entire structure and building was only to be occupied as a single dwelling. 3)The door at the rear of the kitchen in the 'old house' connected the two dwelling units by a door. The door had no locking mechanism. The manner of payment of rental should be subject to the contractual determination between the landlord and any tenant. 4)The owner was to provide a copy of any lease signed by him prior to entry of occupation or any alternation in the lease or tenants to it. There was nothing in his Affidavit or the Affidavits of any of his tenants to indicate any concrete steps had been taken to rectify the situation. He may have told the students to remove the items of the 'partial kitchen' but nowhere was it suggested that they had been removed or that he had told them to remove them. 5)Random inspections were to be limited to twice a month with bi-monthly inspections to continue until the City was satisfied that the Order had been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff's officials would be entitled to inspect at random once a month while the owner of the property was the owner."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and Tenant and the operator of the Oshawa Group contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents? 2) Was the loss covered by insurance and whether insurance should have covered the damage; 3) Did estoppel apply? The arbitrator was not limited to the interpretation of the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage and whether the amount of damages. The disputes were with respect to two sets of clauses: repair and loss of rental opportunity. The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions. The decision to award damages was patently unreasonable. Both parties agreed that the standard of review was correctness and that it should be extended to the determination of the facts and to the effect of the legislation statutory tribunal is empowered to administer. The issue on appeal was whether this expanded scope of judicial review should apply to the awards of consensual arbitrators. HELD: The award would withstand judicial review.  1) It was the conduct of the parties that caused the error. They did not have jurisdiction to deal with it outside of their jurisdiction. The conduct of their employees and the manner in which they communicated to the other parties was beyond their jurisdiction to interfere with the award. 2) The arbitrators were not limited simply to interpreting the words in the lease and to giving the clauses an interpretation the language will reasonably bear. They were there in the commercial context and they were done expeditiously. 3) There was no breach of the tenants' rights by virtue of the use of the term arbitration. 4) In exercising their jurisdiction, an arbitrator must comply with the recognized tenets of procedural fairness. 5) The Court should only intervene if they find a genuine excess of jurisdiction by the arbitration clause, not simply where they disagree with his findings. The Court must look carefully at the decision. The decisions of arbitrators are often subject to judicial review outside the jurisdiction of the Court. In this case the Court was not satisfied that the standards of curial deference, and judicial restraint, applied to the decisions of a consensual arbitrator, but rather that they were broadly applicable and the Court could not ignore the fact that the agreement"
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The law firm's counsel had received confidential information from her clients during the course of her employment. The lawyer had advised the client that she would not discuss the files with anyone within the firm with whom she had worked for and that measures were being taken to ensure that no disclosure to any member of the new law firm of the former client's confidential information would occur. The client had not had any contact with anyone associated with the previous law firm concerning the Magnes and L. files nor had she had any knowledge of their existence. The evidence showed that all the screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation occurred prior to the client's arrival and that the instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to. The court was satisfied that the screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case and that there was not a risk of real mischief. There were numerous independently verifiable steps that the lawyer should have taken in order to ensure no disclosure of confidential information occurred."
e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a)) of the Code. As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the officer was called on voir dire. His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer. The impact on the accused was also at the lower end of the spectrum. Although the onus lies upon an accused to establish a Charter violation on a balance of probabilities, demand for breath samples amounts to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The more serious the Charter breach the more likely the Court will be to disassociate from that conduct by weighing in favour of exclusion."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the applicant and her employees (which seems likely) and the employer were to ask the employer whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchisor. The adjudicator rejected the applicant's submission that the employer had frustrated or breached her employment contract, thereby releasing the appellant from any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. The employer then launched an appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as found by the appellant. His decision outlined some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some of the evidence upon Which He Could Have arrived at His conclusions.  2)It is not patently unreasonable to appeal on the basis of an essential event. An event which would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that contemplated by the agreement was not reasonably supported by the evidence. In this case, the event was not trivial. It was an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations. 3)In this case the employer acted reasonably in finding that the applicant had not frustrated or been inconsistent in the employment contract and thus had not fulfilled its obligations. The appeal based on the submission the employer erred in law by ruling that the employee had not been inconvenienced by the employer's conduct is dismissed."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order of Justice Simon J. MacDonald refusing to appoint a court expert and refusing to order the appellant to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. The appellant argues that the chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the appellant was a subsequently treating physician who had not previously treated a person such that he was required to answer interrogatories seeking to determine his opinion at the time he treated the appellant as to what would have happened to him if he had not treated him as he did. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part.  1)The appellant was correct in stating that CPR 19 does not state that a party witness can object to an interrogator on the basis of opinion. It is not sufficient for Dr. Miller to have objected to answer the balance of the interrogatories by simply stating they require an opinion. This is dangerous because it may result in unreliable temporary opinions given by people without all of the relevant information. The safeguards provided in CPR 19.08 will not allow interrogatories to usurp this function without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, and would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  2)It would be unfair to allow interrogatory to usurper the function of an expert witness and to allow them to be used to obtain opinion evidence without the proper safeguards in place, such as the disclosure of expert opinion material, the fairness of the trial judge's preparation time, and the costs associated with such an application.  3)While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions, the appellant should attempt to use language that can be understood by the appellant, his counsel and the Court. The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. In this case the appellant is entitled to have these questions answered, even if this requires the physician to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant during this period of time. The physician is also required to provide the appellant with the names of three other urologists whose names were provided. These opinions relate to the treatment provided.  4)"
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The stated grounds of appeal were that the conviction was against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence; that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight; and that, given the evidence, it was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, Sparrow, which was used in R. v. Grumbo and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The conclusion that night hunting with artificial lights, so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right was justifiable. The appellants had failed to show any error in law by applying the Sparrow test. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not necessary to set aside the decision on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The issue on this appeal was whether the regulations were a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and, if so, whether they were justifiable pursuant to Sparrow. 1)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights; the Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. 2)The trial judge did go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification. That is where the safety purpose of the legislation ought to be considered. 3)The evidence did not show that the accused Indians were Indians under s. 3 of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) but that they had moved to Meadow Lake and now only embark upon traditional Metis way of life during the summer months or other times when their children are not in school. 4)It was not proven that the people of Sapwagamik, who took the scrip in 1906, preferred as a community to hunt in the dark. The Aboriginal group was consulted. 5)It could not be said that the appellantants, like everyone else, were subject to the Saskatchewan regulation that prohibits night hunting by means of an artificial light. They were not seeking food or shelter on un"

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director allowing the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director and it appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals. HELD: The damages are set at $862.50. The plaintiff's claim for general damages is dismissed. 1) The Court rejected the landlord's denial of liability. The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and that her discounting of the value of the furniture, $50 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing went a little too far. It was impossible to believe that the landlord, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed the plaintiff as credible, the Court could not believe that she would have engaged in such a tactics. 2) The damages were set a revised amount of $1,000,000. There was no credible evidence that the plaintiff's original belongings were ruined. The general damages estimate was based on four years of age, which could not be reconciled with the evidence of four or five years old. Jurisdiction was divided between two versions of the facts. The first version was more challenging, had the bylaw inspector's findings been independently confirmed. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The second version was impossible because he could not have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. The landlord testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. The tenant spoke at length about what she regarded as the poor condition of the premises left by the tenant, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She wondered aloud why if there was mould that it only affected the tenant's furniture and area rug, and was not obvious on the other carpeting. This is a legitimate question which, while relevant, is not really answerable at this time. The two versions were as far apart as they could be. The applicant's task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging had I not been able and inclined to rely on the Bylaw Inspector's findings. He was able to detect mould and to detect the presence of mould in the premises."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, arguing that it was based on the deceased's gross income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: The respondent's decision was set aside and the estate was directed to recalculate and pay the respondent the Death Benefit to her as a surviving spouse and her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this Court. 1)The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $603.25 per week for 14 days, payable every 14 days.  2)The only income replacement benefit available to the surviving spouse in s.146(1) was $500 per week until the date of her death. The death benefit was one-half the 'income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 4. The meaning of this payment was that the payment was made to the survivor on a weekly basis."

HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender which was awarded to another tenderer who had less experience in the area and got favourable reports. The Plaintiff sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of the contract is that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give any of them an unfair advantage over the others. 2)Curniski used reliable independent sources for his information. The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant. This clause does not entitle the defendant to disregard its obligation to treat the tender system and no tenders to accept. 3)Cuziski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.  4)Had it been an event of fact, the plaintiff would have been more successful. The unfavourable report on the plaintiff's planes doomed the tender. It now appears that the plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor. A fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation.  5)The plaintiff was treated fairly and opposed to its loss of a tender.  6)Costs usually follow the result, but this was an appropriate case to exercise discretion to disallow costs to the successful party."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The children were to reside with the mother H.H. and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems. 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. 2) The father was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both the mother and the father were in care for most of their lives. The permanency committee had explored resources with the Indian Band, A.A. and Narcotics Anonymous once per week. The parents had weekly two hour supervised visits with the social service worker. The evidence showed that the mother was often late for parenting classes, sometimes late for one or both parenting sessions and sometimes late at night. The father indicated that he was not looking forward to going to bed at night because he was afraid of the attention of the Ministry staff. 3) The evidence did not support the father's position on the Harm Reduction Methadone Program notes but the father proposed that he would continue living with the Mother while she first attended anger management class and took anger management courses and he would first attend a parenting class and provide all drug screen results. The mother supported the father on the grounds that he had failed to provide proper programming to the children and that he should continue to live with his mother while he was at the Ministry.  4) H. H. was the mother of two children born in October 2005 and was nearly four years old at the time of this hearing. The two children have been in the care of the Minister for Social Services for the past 12 months and H.O.S. was apprehended at birth as was the father. Both of the parents have had children of their own since they were born. Although the father has had a substantial criminal record, the mother has been on the methadone program for some time and the evidence shows that the father had not followed through with his programming. The issues with the evidence and the parents' failure to follow through with their probation and parole conditions are complex and the"
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

The Crown now applies for third recognition. HELD: The accused is granted a security deposit of $1,000.00.  1) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP officer in charge of the High Risk Offender Response Unit and Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that the accused be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. 2) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal justice system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence, drugs and alcohol he suffered while incarcerated. There were no less than 20 failures to comply with lawful court orders. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as they provide an insight to the accused's degree of impulsivity and inability to telegraph his behaviour. The accused's security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions while in prison. There is a reasonably grounded fear of serious and imminent danger which must be proved on a balance of probabilities."

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. She is also alleged that her condition is a result of negligence attributed to the defendants. The defendant denies the allegations. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. 1)There was no causal connection between the defendant, Dow Chemical, and the plaintiff's damages. Rather, the pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability between the defendants, the Dow Chemical Company and one of the other defendants, namely, Dowcorning Corporation. 2)The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. As result, that defendant cannot be served with the Statement of Claim within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. 3)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages both in contract and tort. The statements of claim do not disclose an actionable wrong on the part of the defendant. It is argued that such a relationship exists because of the relationship such as an employer, employee, or principal agent. 4)The Court was asked to assume jurisdiction in respect to the claim as it relates to the defendant in Saskatchewan under Queen's Bench Rule 31(1)(f) and following what was stated in Moran v. Pyle National (1975) S.C.R. 393. This Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary, although any uncertainty or doubt is to be resolved in favour of the corporate defendant."

The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery.","The applicant power company applied for summary judgment against the defendant's supplier of coal under a Coal Supply Agreement.

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the ground that the judge either overlooked or failed to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give credit to the appellant for his one-half share of them.  1)It was common ground in the trial judge's discretion to adjust the value of the matrimonial property based on 20.4 months of future earnings. If the severance pay is additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to the extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship. 2)The court was unable to find any basis upon which to change the disposition.  3)The judgment was expressly approved by the Court of Appeal as applicable to all such cases, the result was well within his discretionary power and was reasonable result. 4)The appellant was acquitted of all charges."

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and a waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws). The claim also seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'low sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that they have made deceptive and misleading advertisement and representation by selling 'Low the Low Sodium' beverages which the Defendants knew or should have known were no higher or appreciably lowers in sodium, and that the plaintiffs' argument set out in their brief has no factual basis. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted.  1)The Court was comfortable with following this judicial authority and determining the defendants’ summary judgment application prior to having to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification. There was no genuine issue for trial and the expert evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was uncontroverted. 2)It is common practice to place a lot of weight on the evidence of others. The Court would be open to the possibility of other representative plaintiffs to come forward by issuing a new claim under the class action act. 3)While there may be a genuine issue requiring trial in a class action context, the Court would not require it to be tried in a conventional trial. In this case, the facts were undisputed. Consumers would expect a product from others in the line as being meanfully [sic] higher in sodium. The messaging was not that it was low, and so are other similar products, but that it is meanfully lower. 4)There was no evidence to support the assertion that the defendants had misrepresented their product. The Facts were undisputable. The evidence did not rest on the assertion by the defendants that the products were low-sodium and that they did not intend to be 'low- sodium'. The evidence was consistent with what the Court had heard in other class actions cases. 5)It would be possible for the Court to order summary judgment in favour of the claim, but only after the certification hearing had been set."

This provision was fundamental element in the contract.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence.

Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The Crown appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. As for the federal legislation, it has been assumed by both parties that it is in pith and Substance criminal law as decided in relation to its predecessor statute by majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v.

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent was charged with failing a breath test. The stop was part of a spot check program (R.I.D.E.) whose principal aim is to detect, deter and reduce impaired driving. The officer asked to see the appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance and found that there was nothing improper about his driving. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser and gave him a breath sample without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The respondent refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. At trial, the RCMP officer testified that he was stopped because he thought the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The trial judge concluded that the stop was justified because it was urgent that the breath sample be obtained quickly in order to be effective. She found that s. 119 of the Alberta Highway Traffic Act, which authorizes police officers to stop vehicles, to require the driver to surrender his licence on demand, to 'bring his vehicle to a stop and furnish any information respecting the driver and vehicle that the peace officer requires'. The Crown appeal dismissed.  1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It was clear from the cases that when the execution of these general duties involves interference with a person's liberty or property, the powers of a police officer are not unlimited. The use of the word 'forthwith', that is immediately, and at the same time require the defendant to be subject to detention which is sufficiently lengthy to provide an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. Once vehicle comes to a halt, further authorization must be sought elsewhere in the Act. An impaired driver is a potentially lethal hazard that must be detected and removed from the road as quickly as possible. The ability to administer the test immediately helps to protect the public by detecting those who may be danger. The more accurate breath sample will correct the ALERT error. 2)The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyszer demand.

The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault and whether she should have been convicted of assault causing bodily harm.

As far back as the case of R. v. Lepaski, [1989] S.C.R. 844, the Court spoke of the intent required for various assault provisions. The accused was convicted of mischief.

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard.

The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.

He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000 from the account. The next day, he deposited another cheque into his bank account and withdrew $20,000 in cash. This time, the money was lost by the bank. A Provincial Court judge granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work and a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The accused had no criminal record and asked that a conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 100 hours ofcommunity service work. The Crown appealed the conditional sentence. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal was allowed. A conditional sentence was substituted in place of the conditional discharge. A 12 month conditional sentence is ordered with a 1 year probation order and a 2 year restitution order. In R. v. Elsharawy (1997), the Court of Appeal for Newfoundland commented on the prerequisites to valid discharge. The conditional discharge is granted only if that disposition is both in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and a 200 hour community service requirement. The restitution order will remain in place."
e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a year to year lease in which they were allowed to increase the rent on three months written notice. The landlord refused on the grounds that the increase was not for the benefit of the tenants. A Residential Tenancies Board hearing was held on July 10, 1990 and rendered its decision without costs to the parties. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the decision of the Board and the decision and order set aside by the court, that the interpretation of the Act, the Rent Review Act and the Standard Form of Lease is clear. The tenants only gave three months notice of the increase. The Board did not interpret these provisions as granting the landlord the right to demand an increase in rent in the middle of the term. The notice must come at least three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. The board could not say that the standard form of lease really provides a rent increase, since neither the time nor amount are specified."
d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement to be constructed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and sought rectification. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for rectification was dismissed. The court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events.  1) The defendant knew the price of the RTM did not come with a basement. It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the basement. 2) The plaintiff is entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on $1,716.28.  3) The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the Court was not satisfied that there was an agreement reached."
3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The application for an injunction restraining the respondents from soliciting, contacting, making contact with or providing service on equipment that was sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc. (Danka); 3) Injunctive relief until trial was necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough; and 4) The Court found that the respondent had put at least some of its former employees on notice of what its expectations were with respect to confidentiality and competition. These employees took with them proprietary and confidential information which will then be used by them and Brennan to further erode Danka's market share and solicit its clientele."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office have rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded in March 2015. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The length of time between the appointment of a bill for assessment and the actual payment is outside of the 30 day time period provided by the Act. There are accounts outstanding that have not been paid in full, totaling $53,059.71. 2) The information put forward here on a substantial number of files should be much more specific. The information presented is not from her own direct observations and conflicts with the evidence provided from sources who had the opportunity to directly observe. It is not sufficient to make a general complaint that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect the same things to thereafter be scrutinized in detail. 3) The notion of 'block billings arising in argument and not being based on concerns expressed by the applicant is problematic. It attempts, in essence, to assess an ongoing relationship rather than the provision of services on a particular matter. A review of the recent case law highlights a number of factors that judges have used to determine whether to abridge the time for applications to assess legal bills. The requirements set out in the Act are considerably less stringent in the present legislation than it was in the replaced legislation. The applicant is entitled to rely on the evidence put forward."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a social worker as a witness. She testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in allowing such evidence and treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence of the social worker was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After consideration of the entire record, it was concluded that it did not."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant plead guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s.334 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and an 18 month period of probation. He appealed on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was inadequate. The appellant had received no useful information about his past or present substance use. The evidence did not show a significant change in the appellant since his release on bail. It was not in society's interest for the appellant to be removed from his present positive environment and placed in custody."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The issue was whether the parties had cohabitated for more than 90 days and whether this constituted a breach of their agreement to live separate and apart. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the separation agreement was between the parties and that they would not cohabit for longer than 90 day periods. The respondent was evasive, argumentative and untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. JUDGMENT: 1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave for the cohabitation; 2) The untrue statements set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to his residency; and 3) His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The petitioner swore the parties cohabited for ten days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until June 30, 1997. The Respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitations extended from June 30 1997 until September 18. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the co-habitation would have extended for at least 95 days. The appellant was awarded costs of the trial in the amount of $10,000."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. 2270/97 pending the petitioner's application or further court order;(b)restricts the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive; and(d)restrorbs the respondent with the costs of any application or hearing pending his application or any court order.HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the Act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. This $40,000 figure is purely arbitrary and either party may at any time apply to raise or lower it based on evidence available at the time of such application. 1)It was not satisfied that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order were identical to those that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. 2)The respondent had failed to meet the tests set out in The Interpretation Act. The legislature had apparently determined that the protection of dependants outweighs an individual's rights in property. The strength of the plaintiff's case, whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted, versus the probability of harm to the defendant if it is granted.

2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. She sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. The husband had previously filed an application for consolidation so that one hearing would be possible. The wife's application sought to strike or amend the husband’s application for child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement was that the wife had agreed to pay child support based on the information contained in the loan agreement. There was no evidence that this agreement had materially changed since the date of the loans. It was also clear that neither the wife nor the husband treated these obligations as child support and that neither of them declared it as income. The applicant had not been required to pay any of the outstanding debts. The indemnity agreement may be something that could be relied on as a promise made to the wife in the event that she was called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. The parties had entered into an agreement that the loans would be repaid in full by the wife. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the retroactive order."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: In this application, one of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity at the time of making his Will. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for trial to establish the 2013 will in solemn Form. The Court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. 2) There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on the defendant. It is presumed that the testator knew the contents of the will, freely approved of those contents and possessed the necessary testamentaries to the Will in question. However, the presumption, short-lived, may affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption. 3) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. In this case, the test is whether the evidence presented is sufficient to meet the tests contemplated within the procedural framework. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances of the defendant's estate and its history with respect to its five adult daughters. It was found that, in contrast to the present day, the defendant had been very emotional and appeared to be unable to deal with the concerns raised by the daughter particularly regarding her lack of mental capacity. 5) The defendant's conduct during the visits at the nursing home and at the hospital was of little or no importance to the Court as the issues were complex and did not accord with the standard of proof set out in the Ritchie judgment. The defendant had not shown sufficient initiative on the part of the Court to challenge the will in such a fashion as to require trial."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied on the ground that he failed to provide requested information as to his income. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was heard by the Assistance Board on September 6, 2007. The Department refused to cooperate with the application board and the applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $750.00 exclusive of disbursements. The Applicant intended to appeal the Board's decision based on non-disclosure. However, the Department was provided further information in October 2007 and the application was not reinstated until June 2007. If the applicant had the right to ignore decisions of the Appeal Board, the appeal board's function would be meaningless, as the Board had clearly stated in its decision to grant the application. In Dewolf v. Rent Review Commission (1982), 56 N.S.R. (2d) 403(N.S.)T.D.) where the court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Board enforced. There was also a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and a duty owed must not be discretionary in nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The board so erred that it could not properly exercise its judicial functions under the Act in making determination of whether the DeWolf's were 'persons in need' under the Social Assistance Act. Even if it meant in this case complete refusal and rejection of the appellant's decision, the Court would have to order the appellant to implement the Appeal board's decision."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.

The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the applicant's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the Statement of Claim to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. There are good policy reasons in support of the conclusion that a victim who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. However, this is not the case in every case. The plaintiff bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the appellant, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in the proceeding. He bears the cross-examination and cross-examining evidence which is presented throughout the proceeding to prove his self- defence.  3) In Sagon v. Royal Bank of Canada et al (1992), 1992 CanLII 8287 (SK QB), 89 Sask R. 16 (Q.B.) Grotsky J. wrote at p. 24. A verdict in a Criminal trial is in admissible as proof of the party's failure to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 4) In Montgomery v. Black, [1989] B.C.J. No. 1800 QL Melvin J. faced a similar circumstance. He relied on s12 and 14 of the Partnership Act. The outcome in each proceeding is irrelevant since the parties, issues, and proof are somewhat different. One who is convicted of a criminal assault is not immune from later civil action for the damages resulting from that assault but he will be excused from paying punitive damages to his victim."
d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal","The Police Review Board conducted a hearing de novo and reached the same conclusion as the investigating officer regarding the complainant's 'guilt' of the alleged misconduct, specifically that she had permission of the Chief of the Police to attend a meeting. The Board found that the complainant had not given permission for her to be present at the meeting and that the penalty imposed was a reprimand. The applicant appealed. Dismissing the application, that the Board's decision to not refer to what the Review Board considered a 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only and did not materially affect the procedural fairness of the proceedings."
4_1994canlii3885.txt,"The Respondents contracted with the Department to care for a child and his Mother who was mentally disabled. After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in the home of the respondent. The mother was placed with the appellant and the respondent [M.H.] and the child was placed solely with the respondent (A.H.). The relationship between the mother and the children broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. The appellant further contends the trial judge misconstrued important evidence and misinterpreted important facts. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access by the mother. 1)The trial judge was correct in his statement of the law that his duty was to determine what custodial arrangement was in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in clause (i) of s.8. The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist, as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for the child and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time. 2)The respondent cross-appealed for costs on the Queen's Bench tariff on trial below and on double Column on appeal."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is ordered for a total of eight months. There is no dispute that the applicant and the respondent cohabited for in excess of 2 years. However, the fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. The fact that the respondent and the petitioner cohabitated for some time and that the petitioner is a'spouse' by virtue of the Act means that she is entitled to interim spousals in the amount of $20,000, however given the short-term relationship and given the issues resolved sooner rather than later, these payments should be paid. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make interim child support orders in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. It is now clear that the Court can make interim orders in this case in relation to family property in favor of the applicant. 2)The fact that this Court may order person to provide maintenance for his or her child, in accordance with need, is somewhat cloudy. During the course of the chambers hearing, counsel for the petitioner further refined her request to an interim distribution of $2,349. This is the amount that counsel for Ms. McPhail holds in trust after certain property was sold. It was never contemplated that the items sold would be of significant value to the petitioner. The respondent, at this interim stage, ought not be responsible for paying child support and, if so, an indirect way to claim child support from her."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits payable under the Act were payable in the amount of $47,427.00 being the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3). The deceased's children were entitled to such benefits as was the case here with the exception of the youngest child, who was not attending school."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

The defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of the plaintiff for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. The question posed was whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry; if so, how is it claimed and are such documents privileged as between the Plaintiff and Defendants? Who is responsible for the cost of production of any documents? HELD: 1) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. These questions, together with the disparate positions taken by the participants in their written submissions, demonstrate confusion and misunderstanding as to the nature of the act and consequently of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.  2) Questions 3 and 4, and the first branch of fall to be resolved on the basis of the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having been demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant modification of the rules."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been referred to as an 'information to be searched' by the RCMP. The applicant alleged that these documents were found at his place of business, located in his and Ms. Taylor's residence, and in any storage facilities occupied by the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant's own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. Unless real bias can be shown, such prior contact is not sufficient to raise an appearance of bias. The issues were as follows: 1) There were no court proceedings under the Divorce Act or the Matrimonial Property Act.  2) The interactions between the applicant and the lawyer giving rise to reasonable apprehension of bias are too indirect or inconsequential to raise the issue of bias; and 3) The respondent was more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the Court was satisfied that the respondent's evidence supported the inference, which he should not have taken for granted."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant was not entitled to any more than nominal damages. The court erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. As the defendant had not elected to treat the contract as being at an end when given notice of her dismissal, the employment contract had not terminated until after they had secured the contract for their own benefit. The employer has not abandoned its duty of good faith. The Court of Appeal held that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although the plaintiff gave notice that she would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, she was still employed at the time she made her proposal.

In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.

Such inconvenience as was suffered during the year following the accident will be adequately compensated. 3)The plaintiff shall have her costs taxed."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent was entitled to child support in the amount of $181 per month. The Court was not prepared to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts."

The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen. The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time. One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen. He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who believed there were dead tuna in a tuna pen. He used diving equipment borrowed from the defendant and another individual who was not present on the day of the accident. After a medical examination, it was determined that he died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. The court found that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the defendant's boat and that the others were his crew members. The defendant had a profit-sharing agreement pursuant to which 10% of the gross was paid to the defendant, 10% to the plaintiff and 26% to Harnish as boat share. After expenses, the net profits would be divided equally among the four. The plaintiff was not entitled to any kind of authority over the other fishers."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the amount of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. 1) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) The respondent claims that he owned several machines prior to the marriage. Over the years he has owned mostly machinery of significant value. However, when consider the testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, it is my conclusion that the father is the actual owner of the tractor. He is not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it. 3) The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court will not take them into account. 4) There is a claim for $16,500 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. The petitioner can hardly be heard to say he owes money for it. However the legislation does not permit such in the circumstances of this case. 5) The father is entitled to register a judgment as charge against the family home."

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their 3-year-old son, and awarded child support to the appellant of $2,726 per month. The appellant appeals only portions of the interim order relating to spousals and exclusive possession. HELD: The application to lift a stay of proceeding is allowed. It is understood that the purpose of lifting a stay is to minimize prejudice pending the appeal and to balance the competing interests of the respondent who has been successful against those of an appellant who ought not to be prejudiced simply by appealing."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree in Accounting. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. She suffered a miscarriage while in the marriage. She sought a lump sum or periodic term of maintenance to allow her to upgrade her education so that she could become financially independent. The respondent denied entitlement. Allowing the application and awarding the sum of $100 per month interim maintenance, that there was some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to obtain a new motor vehicle and the fact that she did not upgrade herself as a result of her marriage.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. See Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. v. Gozanski, et al, (1994) for example.  1) The registered owners have had ample since their separation to resolve their family property dispute. The foreclosure proceedings have been in progress for six months. The registered owner believes that it can be sold in four to six weeks for between $124,000 and $125,000 if shown to prospective buyers. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement. 2) The application is dismissed. 3) Border Credit is entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. Any further delay that does not result in sale and payment of the mortgage in full, will result in lost security value for the Credit Union. 4) The applicant is not entitled, in these proceedings, to a possession order."

The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until a further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until further order. 1)The applicant raised a substantial question to be tried. The Court established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right that the applicant might have. The applicant has shown more than the mere prospect or anapprehension of injury. It has shown that the defendants in doing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights are doing so in a manner which is in breach of that right. 2)The balance of convenience in the matter favours the applicant. The applications were granted. They were granted in the amount of $1,000.00. 3)Interim injunctions were granted against the defendants and any person acting under their instruction or behest or members of said Unions. 4)An interim order was granted in respect of the unlawful picketing which had occurred at various of the applicant's premises, places of operation and work sites."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. The Crown put a street value of between $2000 and $2000 on the drugs and the respondent valued the drugs at slightly under $2000. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. However, the sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. Upon conviction, the first step he ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was “offence property” within the meaning of the Act and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission and the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. The trial judge found that “basically all of the money” to pay for the truck came from the parents’ bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. 2) The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The judge was satisfied he was relatively young and had no prior record. The father was depressed and remorseful. 3) The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. 4) There is nothing turning on the failure to give notice as the parents were fully aware of the proceedings and their interests were dealt with by the judge although he was wrong in his decision. This section allows innocent parties who have valid interest in the property to apply for an order of forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that it had correctly decided that compensable gradual onset stress required that there have been work-related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The issue was whether the Policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. WCAT did not err by considering whether stressors experienced by the worker had been unusual or excessive on an objective basis in the sense required under the Policy. This reflects the law which was in place before 2005. The Board exercised its policy-making authority to bring clarity to these issues. The Policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The only issue which arose was whether gradual onset trauma was compensable as a result of the policy. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level and found that GECA reflects the present state of our law. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having accepted that there were 'unusual or excessive' workplace stressors in the workplace, and faced with the evidence of a 'personal conflict and ineffective management' evidence supporting a causal link between those stressors and his stress injury, she failed to draw that causal link. There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. The question is whether the policy applied the correct legal test in light of the evidence in this record (the issue raised by the second and third grounds of appeal) is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. This is consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick."

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood; and having been found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine. The accused testified that he did not intend to drive the vehicle. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence.  1) The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80 might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2) The only issue on which requested briefs from the Crown and Defence was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time."

During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.

HELD: The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. 1)Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b)to be informed of that right; and (c)to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful. 2)In R. v. Ryland, 2010 SCC 36 (CanLII), the accused alleged a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b). As well, he had claimed that his rights under the Charter against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained had been breached. 3)The Court reviewed the relevant authorities and found that at no point was there evidence that there was a waiver of the right to reasonable opportunity. The officer had no involvement with the accused in respect to the issue of choice of counsel and ensuring the accused had ample time for that to occur because that would normally be the duty of the officer. 4)The self-incriminating evidence against the accused was excluded from the evidence in accord with s. 24 of the Charter. The police must provide the detainee with reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The detainee is in the control of the police and he cannot exercise the right unless the police provide him with a reasonably opportunity to do so. 5)The officer has a duty not to request an accused to provide samples of his breath unless and until the police officer has obtained a clear and unequivocal waiver from the accused that he is aware of all his rights and no longer wishes to contact counsel. In the absence of that duty the Court must determine whether the Crown met any onus on it to establish that the accused waived his rights."
e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss253(b) and 255(1), and driving while disqualified contrary so s 259(4), all of Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and at all material times. There was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the impugned conduct."

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005. The Trustee was appointed as trustee in bankruptcy. During the trustee's stay of proceedings, the Trustee discovered that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession. The trustee refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an interim injunction. Pricewaterhouse retained Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors. When he attended at the premises, he found that there was a rental of the premises to Mr. Muller personally and no lease agreement was made. He instructed his staff to remove the inventory to another location and they began to carry out their instructions before the trustee arrived. HELD: The application for summary judgment was continued.  1)There was no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the claim or the defence. The mere statement by the defendant that that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issues issue exists. 2)County Realty Limited was entitled to summary judgment. 3)The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff had established a bona fide issue and that his claim was supported by the evidence of County Realty Ltd. employees. 4)Costs were to be determined on the basis of the determination by the Court of Appeal as to the amount of costs."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay at 6 percent per annum. 1)Had the plaintiff made continuing and diligent efforts to find employment, she would have been awarded damages in the amount of $924,000.00. 2)Had there been any doubt as to the nature of the employer's proposal, there was no doubt that the plaintiff had been rebutted by the employer. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of the proposed changes. There was no question that the employer put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her and it was one that she obviously could not accept. No doubt the employer wanted to get rid of the plaintiff. However, no reasonable person would have thought that such a proposal was insulting, an insult or degrading to an employee of six years whom the defendant had acknowledged merited the highest recommendation. 4)No reasonable person could have expected that the six month notice period offered by the defendant in relation to the length of employment would be extended to eight months.

6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and were married in 2001. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the parties' relationship was traditional, the father had abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. The result was that the father was not entitled to the child tax benefits and had been overpaid. It is important to give the child a consistent source of income so that they can transition easily between homes. 2) The father has bounced from home to home. The boys receive minimal direction or discipline. There are three bedrooms in the basement one for Damion, one for Seth and one for Johnathan. There is a further bedroom in the master bedroom. The parties' home continues to be under renovation and occupied by the father. Despite his physical injuries, he is assisting with the renovations. He will plead not guilty to all charges, including driving over.08. 3) The parties had an agreement that the parties would continue to receive the Child Tax Credit and child support but that the payments would be based on 90 per cent of the father's income. There were no boarders at the present time."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: 1) The original order was correct at the time it was made. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned an average of $55,120 per annum. This actual situation does constitute material change. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then he has avoided paying anything for a considerable period of time. In light of his recalcitrant approach to his support obligation, neither the passage of time nor the quantum of the arrearars should deter him from the fact he's avoided providing any meaningful financial support to his children and his former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place. 3) The Court must accept the original Order was correct and it was not made in 2005. It must then determine whether it should be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income that was said to have been earned by the respondent. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is unclear why he discontinued any interest in this invention, but it appears he was not able to find employment in his chosen field, or otherwise to continue to earn an income. It appears he has had little ability to continue with the manufacture of the invention. While this recognition is of assistance, it is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent, who is now earning $88,808.88 per year. The children have each attended post-secondary education. The Court therefore determined that the payor has the ability to pay. The Arrears from 2013 to date will be adjusted to accord with the income as found by the Court for the reasons stated in Trang Trang, 2013 ONSC 1980 (2d Supp) 364, and there will be no variation of the order"

The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law.

The procedure to be followed in dealing with an application for adducing fresh evidence should be as established in [1988] S.C.R. 480. 1) The fresh evidence rule has been stated many times and is summed up in [1980] SCC. The same rule should apply with respect to an order refusing to terminate an order for permanent care and custody. 2) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases. 3) On special grounds inspect or view any place or thing."

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she sought exclusion of evidence or a mistrial. Mistrial ordered. The accused was relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings regarding trial process, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence at trial. She was entitled to re-elect. There was no mistrial and the accused was acquitted. The court was satisfied that the accused had succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence and that she had been prejudiced. The new evidence can be used by the Crown to impeach the accused's testimony and contradict things she had told to Sergeant Kelly in her video taped statement. There is no suggestion Crown disclosure is incomplete. The complainant made significant decisions regarding the conduct of her defence during her re-election process that affected her credibility. She made important tactical decisions on the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements to elect trial by judge and jury and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case. This would frustrate the truth-seeking function of the court when Crown non-disclosure was inadvertent. This is an important case because it could lead to the creation of new evidence which could be used to discredit the accused’S credibility. A mistrial would be unfair to the Crown because the new evidence would go to the mens rea element of the offences alleged against the accused and would affect her ability to defend her rights."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.

The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

Specifically that they had not within the required time frame meet the requirements set out in the legislation. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs of the action. 1) The legislation requires an unconditional and unequivocal commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance a purchase of land. 2) In Saskatchewan farm land context, the commitment to finance referred to in the Act means mortgage financing for the vast majority of persons who would be seeking to exercise right of First refusal. To interpret the letter of commitment as a declaration in the act in a manner that would exclude mortgagefinancing, would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of refusal. 3) It is against the grain that most farmers who have recently experienced difficult financial circumstances, for the simple reason that banks do not issue letters of credit unless they are already secured or satisfied that the person on whose letter is to be issued is good for the money on an unsecured basis."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death could found a conviction; (2) instructing the jury they could return a first degree murder conviction on the basis of s.231(5) of the Criminal Code; and (3) failing to give adequate instructions on the defence of drunkenness. The court also found errors in the jury selection process.","This was an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder. The trial judge's instruction to the jury contained several serious errors, the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder.

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the respondent voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother seeks sole custody, allowing her to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence of the doctors. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The medical examiners did not meet the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. The doctor's opinion was based upon the knowledge that the plaintiff was impaled on an iron fence for approximately 25 minutes and that the injury was a 'through and through' wound. 2)The plaintiff did not reveal any of the possible signs of infection or of what to look for if infection set in. 3)The pain and suffering was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in the manner prescribed by the medical doctors. The medical evidence showed that antibiotics should have been prescribed, the plaintiff should have seen his family doctor the next day, and the would should not have been closed. 4)On the totality of the evidence, it was clear that the subsequent infection was caused, in part, by the injuries themselves. The defendants failed to take the necessary steps to best manage the wound. The plaintiff suffered from mild to moderate pain and significant scarring, which was the direct result of the injury. 5)Although the medical reports and the discharge advice were adequate, the real fault lies with the plaintiff who, for whatever reason, failed to reveal fully what had happened to him. He was not negligent in not giving adequate instructions."
2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff set at $1,000. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $4,000 that he paid to the defendant. 1) The Court was satisfied that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. However, the defendant simply forgot about the discussion and the work was done. 2) The plaintiff was liable to pay for all extras which he requested. He was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. Only an estimate was provided and some tolerance should be allowed. 3) Costs of Performance were to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value. The Court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any of the extras and dismissed the claim against him."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
6_2004skca168.txt,The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.,"The appellant appeals from an order which directed that the daughter of the parties attend kindergarten during the seven week period before trial. The application for variation does not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. The respondent's motion under Rule 15 is now moot. Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party. The real issue is where the child will attend kindergarten. Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there shall be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004. Commencing in January 2005, the child shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon. The move to Saskatoon will affect the terms of the final order with regard to the parenting issue. Danelle's primary residence and where she will attend school will need to be resolved prior to her entering Grade 1. That is a matter that should be left to the trial judge. Applying a discretionary power, fact that serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal, is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month in order to preserve the farmlands in specie for conveyance to the children at age twenty one. The Executors did not oppose the application under the Wident's Relief Act but the petitioner's new spouse applied for a reduction in the amount owing on the farm machinery, grain and livestock expenses. HELD: The maintenance was to be varied annually from $250 per month to $500 per month. Pursuant to an order of February 25, 1991 granting corollary relief in divorce proceedings the child would be entitled to share equally with his brother, Bruce, in the estate. 1)Personal effects were physical chattels having some personal connection with the deceased such as articles of personal or domestic use or ornaments, clothing, furniture or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm.  2)The term 'personal effects' did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery or equipment or other immovable assets.  3)The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. These calculations were only crude estimation but had attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate could reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances, while still giving effect to the Testator's intentions to preserve farmlands for their age."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and had admitted in their evidence at trial that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets, that the only aboriginal right the Court should consider was an aboriginal right to fish for food. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Territory Order passed in s. 146 and s. 35. The accused offered a constitutional defence based on the evidence of his clients, Elders of the Metis, who had conducted interviews with number of people in the area, and expert evidence from Professor Frank Tough, Associate Professor of Native Studies at the University of University of Saskatchewan. The defence counsel for the accused served notice of the constitutional question they intended to raise on behalf of the accused on the Attorney General. The notice identified their aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada and included references to s. 91(24) and 146 of theConstitutional Act. In issue was commercial fishing. It was open to the defence to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginal right to Fish for Commercial purposes as opposed to fishing for food only. HELD: It was the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for commercial purposes because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purpose. The appeal on this point is limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4). It is the defence's prerogative to argue the case on the basis of the Aboriginal right that is in issue. 1) Commercial fishing is not an issue in this case. The facts at trial clearly established that your clients intended to sell any fish that they caught at Moberly Lake or Fox Lake. Therefore, the fishing is a valid aboriginal right. 2) The Crown at no time intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion. 3) It is not necessary for the Crown to prove anything"

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer.

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The appellant argued that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that it was against the interest of other members of the Association to allow a person, who has been convicted of serious charges, to indefinitely postpone the imposition of penalty. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. He appealed the decision of the I.D.A.'s disciplinary panel. Application for interim injunction granted; the appeal Division found that the applicant would not have satisfied the requirements for a interim injunction in the circumstances described in the application for the interim injunction; the Court of Appeal did not permit the application to proceed in any fashion other than in very special circumstances. The applicant's medical evidence was flimsy and it was premature to say at this stage that the respondent would not receive a fair hearing under the Constitution."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and cocaine and a knapsack with a large amount of cash. At a subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale and a black wallet were found in the accused's car and he was driving erratically. The accused was a student the previous year and was unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source. The police had found a backpack stuffed with cocaine and cash which the accused had placed at his feet in the back of his car. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of all three charges before the court.  1) The Court accepted the uncontroverted expert evidence that the amounts of both marijuana and cocaine were found at the street value of $100 and all of the circumstances establish that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking and so find. Possession of property obtained by crime (Criminal Code s. 4(3)) The evidence was circumstantial, which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from was that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. 2) The Crown did not call evidence, but argued that this was an admissible case in which the Court could not draw a direct inference from the evidence to draw a reasonable inference. The Court was satisfied that the three rolls of cash in the amount of $1000 were in his possession and that, because they were in small denominations, found on the same bag as large amounts and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was not present on the wharf at the time of the investigation they were seized knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. 3) The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused. The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt (as it did in this case) that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its presence and had some measure of control over it. It is also obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. 4) The accused is guilty of the following charges: personal, where a person has something"
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The defendant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the defendant or to the plaintiff. The defendant denied living in the basement and denied being a seller of methamphetamine. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.  1) The defendant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who, indeed, represents him before the Court. 2) The evidence of the plaintiff and her friend fails the test for admission for slightly different reasons. The Court is aware that the appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. No notice was given to the Crown of the application for fresh evidence and the original notice of appeal did not make reference to the possibility of an Application to Adduce Fresh Evidence. 3) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos, who was a fellow methamphetamine user, she does not swear that the defendant was selling methamphetamine on April 17, 2003, the date when the offence was alleged to have been committed. She was in the open portion of the basement of the duplex and did not give him a place to stay. There being no new evidence, the Court would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems."

The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

A solicitor for the applicant took the position that no solicitor-client relationship existed and, therefore, Chapters IV and of the Code of Professional Conduct have no application. No solicitor client relationship was created between the applicant and the law firm in 1995. Its interests were then adverse to those of Lois Hudson who had her own lawyer. Whatever documents delivered to his lawyer in 1995 were not needed to support his legal proceedings. They were sent to Lois Hudson's lawyer. The fact that the applicant now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not, in my opinion, change the situation that existed in 1995HELD: There was no solicitor client confidentiality and no fiduciary duty resulting from the acceptance by the applicant of documents from her. Whatever duty was owed by her was to the applicant. Lois was not required to take any action or to refrain from doing anything. Neither was the lawyer a party to the action. No breach of confidentiality occurred or a conflict of interests arose as contemplated by Chapters III and V of the CofP Conduct. To extend the confidentiality of solicitor client relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in the view, lead to unreasonable results."

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was 3 years of age. The third child (R.M.) was born in 1997 and lived with the mother and her grandparents until December 2001, when the Agency services were terminated. The Agency continued to visit the children and in January 2001, the Agency provided transport and money to secure the child's diaper rash lotion and product. In February 2001, two of the children separated again. The police made a referral to Children's Aid when N.D. was expecting her second child. There is no more information on this referral. It appeared to be based on caution, given the actual cause of K.D.'s death was never determined. All four children have been in temporary care with the Agency since December 2001. A further child (O.D.) has been placed in the supervised care of the Agency. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency conducted a summary or discussion based on all of the findings. In April 2003, a Child Abuse Test was conducted and the results of the Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test were published. In May 2002, a Family Skills Worker was appointed as expert witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. The child had a slight five code type. This code type is relatively infrequent and occurs more in women than men. These individuals are very comfortable with themselves and their behavior. As consequence they report mainly emotional distress and are relatively free of any disabling anxieties or guilt. They are in good physical health. They report they do not abuse substances. It is unclear when one looks under the heading, 'N.D's mental status' why it was necessary for the assessor chronicle whether or not she had tattoos and the nature of the tattoos. I am at a loss to see how that would have an effect on any determination that have to make, or that he had to make."

He was remanded until his sentencing, which was scheduled for December 4, 1995. The Crown opposed the application for bail pending appeal. The appellant had the onus of satisfying the three conditions of s.679(3). He abided by the terms of the pre-trial release and had strong economic and family ties to his community. The real issue was the question of the public interest. The cases referred to where bail was sought prior to sentencing and in R. v. Smale (1980), 1979 CanLII 2925 (ON CA), 51 C.C. (2d) 126; and Osolin (Ont. C.A.). HELD: The appellant was released from custody pending his sentencing on the grounds that his detention was not necessary to the public good. The grounds of his appeal were not frivolous nor did it seem that there was much risk he would not appear in court when ordered. The court distinguished between the two cases and noted that the fact that the appellant had a lengthy record as a result of his convictions did not make this decision more strenuous than it would have."

The parents sought custody, or alternatively, to have the child remain with the present foster family. HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years. The natural parents were to have reasonable access. 1)The child was in need of protection. The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department. She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm. The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly. The child's special needs resulting from attention deficit disorder required enormous amounts of care and attention on a daily basis. 2)It was in the child's best interests to remain where she was and to continue to have contact with her natural parents.","The Department was requesting a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act. The foster parents had cared for the four and one-half year old for nearly 3 years with the assistance of parent aide [F.S]. The father was abusive and physically abusive to the mother and to her. The mother was hospitalized for attention deficit hyperactive disorder and the child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. HELD: The child was in need of protection and the natural parents were unable to care for the child particularly given her special needs. 1)It was absolutely clear to me that it was in the child's best interest to remain where she was and tocontinue to have contact with her natural parents. Given the special needs of the child, it was unlikely that an adoption plan would be made, and indeed to remove the child from the foster home could be extremely damaging and emotionally traumatic for the parents. 2)The natural parents, [L.C.] and her husband, were committed to the child and would care for her until she was 18. The natural parents testified that they love the child like our own and will not take in any other foster children as long as they have her.

2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.

The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the Husband would have interim sole custody and the Wife had access to the child through reasonable notice. The respondent brought an interim custody and access agreement in 1997. At that time the applicant was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a long-distance truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now worked day job in Saskatoon and the applicant changed jobs. She now lived in the home with her sister and had just recently been discharged from hospital. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of any evidence that the child or children are in some way at risk or other compelling reason. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk of a child exists), but proceed to a final order. 2)The applicant was granted access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:00 pm. Every other day until 8:00 am until 12:00 at which point access will be restricted to the applicant who commences kindergarten each morning and is with the respondent's sister each afternoon. 3)The alternative variation in access she has to Jacob would have the effect of decreasing the risk of an emotional breakdown and would not cause needless disruption to the children."

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the Canadian Armed Forces between 1951 and 1972 and who was discharged in March of 1972. The Plaintiff was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either under the Indian Act or any other relevant Act or Statute in force under the Canada Pension Act or other applicable legislation. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. All claims brought pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act are subject to a limitation period of 6 years. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that were individual to the class members. The Court was reluctant to deny a class member's day in court. 1) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England, if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. There is no suggestion that Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits after 1953. There was nothing before the court to indicate that they were properly informed of their right to do so. 2) The Court found that there was no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. There were no errors in law, the facts as stated in the pleadings disclosed no reasonable cause of action.  3) The Act reflects an increasing recognition of the important advantages that the class action offers as a procedural tool. It is essential that courts not take an overly restrictive approach to the legislation, but rather interpret the Act in way that gives full effect to the benefits foreseen by the drafters. The benefits which the plaintiffs say were not paid to Indian war veterans in the 'Class Period' are set-up for a class proceeding and will be available to all members of the proposed class. The continuation of the action in those circumstances would be inconsistent with the clear legislative requirement that the representative plaintiff be anchored in the proceeding as class member with no stake in the potential outcome."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the respondent was deemed not to be serving the youth sentence he was serving. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the Youth Court is the same as that of R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.). However, the youth justice court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision in the community. This is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) is only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. 2) Section 107(1) provides for an order under s102(1)(b) with any modifications that the circumstances require. It is not an order for review under s103. In fact, it is an analysis of the meaning of the word 'presence' in the context of rehabilitation and reintegration. The essence of the appeal lies in the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of sentence."

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on the proposal he made because it is not his to waive. 2) The respondent exhibited an affidavit that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. It was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My client has instructed me to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; Few would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment. 'What sensible man would attempt settlement if it could be used against him at trial?' This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote."

This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.

The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The application is granted. 1) There has been a breach of the accused's Charter rights. Fairness to the accused requires that even for offences such as these that trials be held within reasonable period of time so that the accused does not suffer undue prejudice and so that her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and to properly defend against the charges can also be defended. On the other hand, there have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. 2) There is no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused any delays. The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's canola crop on one occasion but denies liability. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiff and the defendants together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions. They did not measure, estimate or make note of the number of bushels or tonnes of crop lost. The evidence of wildlife damage was not accepted. Overall the damages were reduced by 5%. The plaintiff's losses were reduced due to poor drainage, poor soil quality, lack of access to the farm and extensive wildlife damage. The defendants were obliged to keep the fence in good repair. The damages sustained by the plaintiff were reduced as a consequence of the defendants' refusal to allow the plaintiff to access his property."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt, who was in bankruptcy for 28 months, objected to the automatic discharge of his former business, Revenue Canada. The bankrupt's claim fell into two parts; $166,359.72 representing net goods and services tax assessed for the period January 1, 1991 to July 31, 1992 and $14,223.30 for unpaid personal income tax for the 1991 taxation year. The claim of the Michalukis was for $58,720.34. Both creditors represented the vast majority of claims of unsecured creditors in this bankruptcy. There was also an issue regarding the use of tax information concerning the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company she was sole director and shareholder of. HELD: 1)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. The Court cannot accept that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of certain portions of the applicant's affidavit. 2)The bankrupt's application for a discharge was opposed by certain creditors. 3)The applicant argued that s.241 of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. 4)Application for a conditional order of discharge was dismissed. 5)The Court was not convinced that these proceedings were final in nature. The determination of the proper order was difficult. The objecting creditor requested a substantial conditional order over a three year period.  6)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 was confidential and non-disclosure was improper."

The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. HELD: The Court accepted the submission that a $25,000 penalty was a significant penalty for Sutherland. Sutherland's failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time.

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The father sought costs of $3,000 based on an application of a scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The court imputed an income level to the father that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000) and assigned additional time to resolve disagreements between the parties. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the father was the appropriate primary care parent. The applicant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed to the applicant by the Court. The Court imputed a level to be determined by the respondent that would correspond to the parties total income. The respondent's submissions needlessly resulted in the expenditure of time and effort by all involved and delayed the issuance of an order herein."
7_2006skpc48.txt,"The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained. The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court, before her trial, before anyone had given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law, and before she had had a chance to defend herself at a trial. HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial was completed. The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the injuries to the victim and determined that the appropriate sentence would be imposed. The Crown had argued that its case was strong, the offence was horrible, and that the public in La Ronge and area were so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public. The accused youth was not related to the current charges or accused youth in any way.  The court agreed with the Crown's position that because several persons have told the police that this youth committed a serious offence, I should confine her in custody even before she has a trial, even before anyone has given evidence in a Court of Law, and after she has had a trial to ensure that she had a proper chance to present her evidence in court. They also agreed that the release would create a negative attitude in the community because of the occurrence of unrelated crimes by unrelated persons.

9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. There is limited evidence with respect to the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with the responsibility of listing the property as to the steps taken. The amount owing under the mortgage was described as being the arrears of principal, $29,994,98 and interest at $995.03 or a total of $30,990.01.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs also sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act in my view precludes this type of pre-certification notice. However, the plaintiff's request is novel. The affidavit was filed for the sole purpose of providing the evidence that the Roussys had settled with the defendant and therefore could not be viable parties to this action. 2) It is important to remember that we are in the pre- certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. An action is defined under s. 8 of the class action as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998' and Class Action is defined as an action certified not as a class action pursuant to Part II' and the defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there is no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The Court is not prepared to broaden the scope of the Judge's decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and implementation of The Rules of Court do not permit a cross-examination of a plaintiff on an affidavit as they do in other cases. In this case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potentially class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. That could result in further motions arising out of this examination."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989. After the separation, the respondent had continued to live with the appellant, who was a full time student. She had recently taken a job which would allow her to work 30 hours week at minimum wage but would require sleep and antidepressant medication. The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours a week at a minimum wage and testified that she was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. This was an error as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000 and the couple's daughter Catherine was still living with him and going to university full time."
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the school board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the Cape Breton Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The school board submits there is an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver the basic public school program, to lease buildings from a third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. The board does not seek reimbursement for rental costs in respect to leases for buildings used in delivering other than the basic Public school Program. The request is based on the submission the Province is statutorily mandated to provide free of cost the buildings that is now before the Court."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears of approximately $14,600 was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. A further order was ordered to be paid in full immediately after the father commenced work as pipe-fitter. The father was to pay child support of $300 per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150.00 per month per child when he is less than $2200. Arrears were reduced by $7,000 and a further $200 was ordered on the ex parte payment of $25,600. 1)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been a material change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant characterizes herself as the successful litigant. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)It is incumbent upon the Court not to permit unnecessary litigation to be paid for by the estate. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor & client costs claimed by the applicant; there is a needs-based approach to assess maintenance, as dictated by The Dependants' Relief Act, 1996. The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be ordered out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. In this situation, however, it is appropriate for the Court to fix the costs to the applicant in lump sum."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order which determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case."
6_2002nssc288.txt,"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01. The sole issue is whether the plaintiff is barred from suing in the province of Quebec because of a motor vehicle accident in Pictou, Nova Scotia. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non conveniens and at the same time the applicants have not provided lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether any of them are resident; whether there are police reports; whether they were seen by doctors; if so, where they are located. If there is a procedural problem, a problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of the place where the injury occurs. The court looked at the factors set out in O'Brien vs. Attorney General of Canada and Oakley vs. Barrie and found that Nova Scotia is forum conveniens. HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. It is an entirely different question, as I said, as to what law will apply to a trial in a Nova Scotia and, as the respondent has stated in his affidavit, the Court concluded that the law is the substantive law that governs will be the law in the Province of Quebec. The Court awarded costs to the applicant in the amount of $400.00 per month for the first two issues and $400 on the third issue. If the plaintiff has chosen Nova Scotia, following the next rule, unless the defendant, that is the applicants here, can show that the question of jurisdiction of the forum will govern, the plaintiff's choice of jurisdiction will govern. In the absence of so many facts, circumstances, and witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant the plaintiff will be unable to tell the Court what law applies to this case. In this situation, the only forum that seems to be forum convenien is Nova Scotia."" The Court found that the applicants had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice and this right was subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non existiens and that more convenient forum exists elsewhere."
6_2010skqb264.txt,Defendants brought an application for an order setting a date for the plaintiffs' application for certification of the class action. The plaintiffs had failed to meet the litigation schedule by failing to deliver their written arguments and authorities and had not applied for an extension. HELD: The order of the Court established a timeline for the plaintiffs certification application and set a hearing date.,"FIAT: The defendants apply for an order setting a date for the hearing of the plaintiffs' application for an Order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to The Class Actions Act as am. HELD: Although the time lines established by the court have expired, there will be an order granting leave to the plaintiffs to serve and file an application extending the times within which steps may be taken leading up to the Hearing of the Plaintiffs' certification motion. If such an application is made, it shall be directed to:(a) Served and filed on or before August 27, 2010;(b) Made returnable on September 23, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. or other date as may be designated by the Court on application by the plaintiffs; and(c) Provide a hearing for the certification motion to be held in February 18, 2011."
e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: The court was of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her privacy and security interests. The court found an order should have been made."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive the ATV. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving a vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. At trial, the Court held that it was not that simple, but the defence was clearly not exempting ATV's from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the motor vehicle Act. They were words used in s.11 of the Act to include an all-terrain vehicle, which was a prohibited vehicle under s. 11, but that is not the charge before the Court at this trial."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was acquitted of all other charges. The Court reviewed the evidence and found the accused guilty of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The trial judge focused on the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her toward the side of the road and deliberately cut her off. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness and refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested she took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the circumstances. The evidence showed that the incident occurred on a residential street and that, apart from two parked cars, no other vehicles, pedestrians or children were present at the time of the incident. It was a case where the accused's manner of driving was dangerous to the public, contrary to the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent driver."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. In August of 2013 the plaintiffs, as represented by the lawyer, applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF and their failure to encourage the children’s learning in French and to encourage their participation in the French immersion program. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its discretion.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw in s. 25 of The Education Act and found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not been discriminated against because of their disability. The Court awarded special damages to the plaintiffs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the application to dismiss the claim, the cost of training and re-training the service dog, notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff under the Animal Protection Act; and general damages for out of pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, costs of the training and refreshment for the children."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts, the application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in finding the application incomplete. The Applicant took issue with the development officer's decision to declare the application complete. HELD: The applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete.  1) the applicant received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, which was in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time it received the application. This decision is set aside. 2) It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The municipality relies upon subsections 278(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide as follows: an application for subdivision approval shall be approved if the proposed subdivision meets the road standards as they existed before it was received. The second requirement appears to be inconsequential. The grounds of appeal would have to be broader and arguably not covered under s. 250(3). The applicant insists that as a matter of law it had a right to have the final approval granted without meeting the higher road standard. However, the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received a tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes is opposed by the applicant."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay 50% of the energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the agreement and brought a motion to stay the action on the basis of forum non conveniens. In this action, the plaintiff paid the defendant what the plaintiff terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The defendant argued that there were triable issues between the parties and the plaintiff's failure to file a defence was merely an excuse for its failure to do so. Dismissing the application, that the default judgment is not a mistake or an oversight. It is, in fact, a deliberate decision by the defendant to fail to meet the requirements set out in the Rule 12.06 of the Court of Appeal. In fact, it is the failure to act within the meaning of the Rule that allows the Court to exercise its discretion to set aside the judgment."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce and custody was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was also disposed of. The petitioner claimed an interest in the standing crops but the respondent closed his case without further argument about calling evidence on the tax implication. HELD: 1) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declines to order any spousal support. 2) The respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the three natural children of the marriage. His income from his farming operation is $101,967 and he is responsible for $50,000 of farm income. 3) The farm partnership had the following debts as of June 9, 1999. The respondent is to pay one-half of the $96,600 paid to the petitioner by the respondent in his percentage based on the Guidelines. 4) The Court is of the view that capital cost allowance taken on machinery should generally not be added back for purposes of determining the income for the purposes of the Guideline purposes. The Court of Appeal agrees that $24,000 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase of the equity in the six quarters. 5) In the event the respondent fails to pay the amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the the petitioner, the petitioner may apply for judgment against the respondent for the amount remaining unpaid. The total costs of the van are to be paid by the petitioner in their respective percentage. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent\'s personal land."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. HELD: In the circumstances, the court was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings support a claim for damages for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.  1) The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. If he does not have particulars the Court must go to the parties. 2) There is no evidence of a statutory or regulatory responsibility within the meaning of the Act. The Act is not an instrument for establishing, operating, or maintaining a school. The common law causes of action may arise from the same relationship and circumstances. The Government relies on R.E.L. v. J.G.S. (2000), 191 Sask. R. 204 (Sask. Q.B.) and the Public Officers' Protection Act which sets forth certain limitation periods depending on the nature of the claim.  3) In the circumstance here, the conduct of discovery and undertaking could provide the plaintiff with particulars to be make its allegations. The practice of law in negligence and contract the parties are taken to be independent and equal actors, concerned primarily with their own self-interest. However, as the defendant was in charge of the residential school at the time, the legislation governs its operation and maintenance. The defendant knew or ought to have known that the claim would be proven at trial, but did not. If there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, the defendant should not be driven from the judgment seat. 4) The evidence of past and future performance by the defendant in relation to all matters of this kind will be ascertained at trial. The evidence is conclusive that the Government is obliged to pay costs to the plaintiff for services performed within the knowledge and peruse of the statute. It is not necessary that the defendant know the law and regulations governing its operation or maintenance in order for the claim to be properly defended."
