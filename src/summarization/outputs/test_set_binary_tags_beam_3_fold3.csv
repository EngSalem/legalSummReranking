d_1994canlii7605.txt,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no error on the part of the trial judge in weighing the evidence.","The accused was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two young complainants were living with their mother. He denied the assaults and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment for the assault on the complainant. The other count was 1 month consecutive. The accused appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge carefully considered the evidence. The evidence did not support the accused's allegations. The inconsistencies in the evidence led to the convictions. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that there was no error on the part of the trial court in conducting the trial or in weighing the evidence, and that the appeal was dismissed without prejudice to the credibility of the witnesses."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1)There are certain procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. These procedures were not followed. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","One of the defendants in the main proceeding moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threats and interfering with the workers conducting the harvest operation. The plaintiff argued the attachment order should be terminated because it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 49.01(1), and that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. HELD: The attachment order was terminated. 1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. 2)Sterling Farm did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions. 4)Costs awarded to the applicant of $1,000 in any event in the cause."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01. There is a total of alterations of preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks. Of the five initialled changes, four are initialled. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(1(g)(i) that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. If Parliament had intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that an approved instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be afforded the Crown, it must be set out in the certificate or proven by other evidence. 2)There was insufficient evidence to identify the alleged approved instrument. It was not sufficiently advanced in the circumstances to advance the case beyond the weight of the certificate. 3)The accused's model did not adequately or adequately describe the instrument. There was no evidence of the model's ability to accurately or adequately identify the instrument or its model. 4)No weight was given to the model in the Certificate of Analysis and the accused was acquitted of all three charges."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim custody with specified access. The petitioner requested that the child support be based on his 2005 income. Given the age and circumstances of the children and the fact that the respondent had not seen the children for ten months, it was uncontroverted that the father's previous ten month income for 2004 was $112,064. When the parties separated, the petitioner unilaterally decreased child support. The respondent did not make any child support payments following that separation. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties that the living allowance ($9,600) would be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. 2) Retroactive child support was warranted. The parties had verbal agreement that the petitioner would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday as that was the basis for the original October 2005 agreement. The verbal agreement was not changed in any event. 3) The petitioner was awarded retroactive support of $185 per month directly to the child care provider, representing one-half of the current child care costs for employment purposes. Retroactive support was not warranted in the circumstances. 4) The Court found nothing in the evidence that rebutted the presumption that a presumption of joint custody is a presumption on an interim basis."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner for reasons beyond the control of either party. The landlord has the advantage of the Landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination. Also, the Tenant has the ability to sublet, if and when he determines he wants to leave early. In the unique circumstances of this case, it was appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary a child support order made in May 2002 because his income had decreased as a result of his being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing the layoff was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage and that she had no obligation to contribute to the child's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1) The husband was to pay child support of $534 per month for the two children and $60 per month in hockey, golf and baseball expenses. 2) The wife's income had increased since the May 2002 order because he was laid off his employment and the child had received employment insurance less his union dues. There was no change in circumstance that would warrant a variation of the support order. The parties' current income was $37,219 as of May 2002 and the wife's annual net income of $29,917 was $54 per month. 3) The child had not commenced post-secondary education by the time the order was granted. Should the wife follow through with her plan and actually commence post-primary education she may requalify as a 'child of marriage' within s. 14 of the Act. The unreasonableness of the husband's disbursements to the wife for child support purposes has not been covered by the material. 4) Husband's contribution for horse riding lessons was not increased. 5) The mother's application to increase husband's contributions for her son's sports and hockey expenses was dismissed. 6) The father was ordered to pay half of the child support payable in the amount of $250. 7) The court could not find that the wife had any obligation to pay for the children's sports, golf, baseball, and tennis expenses. 8) The applicant's obligation to provide financial support for Jasmine was terminated effective March 31, 2003. The court ordered the husband to contribute for the expenses in the fall of 2003."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

The issues relate to 15 properties. 15 properties were decided on one appeal and one property was decided on the other. The test in such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment. The door may still be opened but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure as it may relate to the general. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant."

A Provincial Court Judge sentenced him to 5 months closed custody concurrent with a sentence of 9 months open custody which he was serving at the time of his escape. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences.

9_1996canlii5086.txt,"The 21 year old appealed his conviction of armed robbery, the sentence of three years imprisonment and a ten year s.100 order. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed, the sentence appeal was allowed and one year incarceration with a ten year s100 order were imposed. The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment and a ten year s. 100 order. After being pulled back into the store by the clerk, an altercation occurred between the clerk and the appellant. In the course of the dispute the appellant, while on his knees, was struck several times with a baseball bat and ended up on the floor. The clerk sustained no physical injuries. The Crown concedes this was a 'technically robbery' and the incident was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","Both litigants sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal. The wife took issue with the division of assets and alleged that the judge misapplied the value of the assets held by the parties. She also sought a more favourable division of Assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The respondent husband cross-appealed. He also sought credit for certain receivables he claimed were family debts he should collect and share. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without costs. 1)The judge made certain factual findings that supported his conclusion. 2)The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon decisive or potentially decisive issue. 3)The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Palmer v. The Queen. 4)Although the judge committed no reversible error, the court was unable to find the amount owed for the proceeds was approximately half way between what the wife was claiming and what the respondent was claiming was owed. The judge also found that the accounting errors were either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both. 5)The Court would not order a cash equalization payment as sought by the wife."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","In dealing with the first application, the petitioner sought to vary the child support order granted by the court in 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wished to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 1990 CanLII 6863 (SK QB), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.)Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the court to the 'wishes of the children' issue is to take into account all the circumstances, including the child's wish to change from father to mother. 2)There was no evidence to suggest that this was no longer in the children's best interests. As no material change was demonstrated, the application must be dismissed."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal.

The defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench arguing the trial decision was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with the plaintiff's cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. 2)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking the same question multiple times.

9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike two affidavits filed by the applicant regarding the applicant's failure to attend a hearing before the Council regarding their differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The applicant sought to have the affidavits struck as an attempt to put evidence to the Court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council in its adjudicative setting. The issues were whether affidavits were admissible on an application for certiorari, whether the applicant has the authority to revoke the license of the applicant, if so, what evidence may be attached to them, and whether the Court should restrict itself to considering the record as produced by the tribunal. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There must be a real dispute. The fact that there was an ongoing and clear dispute with respect to the authority of the Board to suspend and deal with licenses and the authority the Council has to be the exclusive administrative body to cancel or revoke or suspend licenses is a real issue. Affidavits are admissible but not always admissible. If the issue is a jurisdictional dispute by tribunal, the application to strike affidavits as admissible will not form authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits. If it is to be denied on the basis of error of law on the face of the record, then affidavits will be admissable to complete the records. 2)The applicant had failed to attend the oral hearing by the Board and to file affidavits relating to the applicant’s positions on the management proposal and the license suspension. It was argued that the applicant had misrepresented its position on the substance of each affidavits and that the affidavit evidence would not be admissible in the circumstances. 3)The court reviewed the history of this case and found that although there had been an error in law by the legislature, this was not an appeal process. 4)There was no evidence of a cause of action on the part of either party. The affidavits would not assist the Court in determining the extent to which the legislature had delegated jurisdiction to the parties."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for damages in the amount of $270,307.05 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract. Roper appealed, arguing that the judge erred in finding that the defendant was in breach of the contract and in holding that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in the contract. Allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, that both parties had breached the contract, Roper by failing to perform and Devco by not providing the approximate tonnages set out therein. Further, the plaintiff failed to establish that the plaintiff would have continued to operate at loss. The trial judge found that even if the defendant had performed the contract effectively, it would not have been able to claim damages as it did. All of the plaintiff's damages related mainly to the costs incurred by the defendant in obtaining substituted performance performance and the refund of overpayments made to the plaintiff for which no work had been performed. Furthermore, most damages related to the defendant's additional effort, costs and expenses beyond that contemplated by the contract in all of the circumstances."

The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"FIAT: The applicants ask the Court to remove the respondent as executor of the estate. They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) This is a case in which the Court should exercise its jurisdiction to remove Evan as an executor. The Court found that Evan had not rebutted the validity of the Will, was refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Will.  2) In an application seeking revocation of a Grant of Probate, and an Order removing the respondent from his position of executor, it is incumbent on the respondent to act promptly in respect of his application, should he decide to proceed with that application.  3) In the case of Whitworth Estate Whitworth, the Court ordered that the respondent be removed as a executor pursuant to a grant to probate. The direction for Kent and Rodney to take no steps to distribute assets in the estate until February 15, 2018 is an extension of that grant. There is no evidence that either of them have acted contrary to their obligations in administering the estate in accordance with the directions in the will."
8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence. The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The Court cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay is insufficient to deny Key its day in court. The application is granted. Costs shall follow the cause."
6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana contrary to s. 4(2) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act. At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that they only had a mere suspicion, and that the warrantless search violated their s. 8 Charter rights. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of that offence, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that it was too late to amend the Information. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were inadequate and did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they did not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered. Although the trial judge erred on the issue of whether the information was an essential element, the reasons were inadequate. There was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused."
1994canlii4187.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce and maintenance for herself and the couple's five-year old child. The wife was working and earned a modest income; the husband a substantial one. Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years, and had been together for 10 years. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment. The husband did not oppose the divorce nor did he deny his responsibility to provide financial support for his daughter. The mother was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. The daughter was the sole owner of the household and the primary caregiver of the child. Although the husband had recently retired from his work as a bar manager, the wife had only a grade education and was working as a minimum wage worker. For the past five years, the husband has paid maintenance to the wife in the amount of $1,500 monthly for an indefinite period and, if the court awards spousal support, the combined maintenance should not exceed $2,200 and cease in June 1995 and continue for the child at the rate of $600.  The mother sought tax relief on the basis of her income. The father, who had recently purchased a house and was paying tax on the proceeds of the sale of the petitioner's automobile, argued that he did not have the financial means to pay for the maintenance.

2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The defendant had issued a consent order in 1999 which authorized the appointment of a Band Councillor as the proper representative of Ochapowace to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. The consent order was amended in 2002 to order that the defendant return the $40,000 paid by Ochampowace and McDiarmid to Mcdiarmid. In addition to the consent order, the defendant brought an application seeking to have the plaintiff examine for discovery for the first time. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and argued that the delay was excusable. Application for dismissal granted; the plaintiff was responsible for an inordinate and legally inexcusable delay in pursuing its claim and the public interest was at stake. The plaintiff was awarded costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the delay and the costs may ultimately be ordered payable in the cause. Although neither party had undertaken extensive communications with the other, both parties appeared to have agreed that Laird Allary, the designated representative of the Defendant, was the appropriate person for the examination in order to determine whether the defendant would suffer serious prejudice if the matter proceeded to trial. The affidavit filed by Bellanger does not satisfy the court that the issue of prejudice should be considered when determining whether it is in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the delayed time. However, the affidavit deposes that the Defendant was aware of the delay in bringing the matter to trial and that it did nothing to encourage a more timely disposition of the case until 2009. The Defendant, either because it considered the matter settled or because it was content to wait for the case to go away, to do nothing in the way of further investigation until 2009, is not blameless respecting its contribution to the delay. HELD: The application for dismissal was granted and the defendant was ordered to complete the undertakings at the examination within 30 days.  1)The delay in this case is comparable to that experienced in the ICC case. 2)There is no evidence to support the conclusion that the defendants' delay in exercising their discretion in bringing this matter forward to trial was entirely foreseeable. 3)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, including Bellanger, had any direct involvement with the contract negotiations. 4)It was in the interest of justice to allow the plaintiff to pursue its claim without delay. 5)Costs awarded to the plaintiff."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused argued that since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting off a driving error, the court need not enter the analysis of whether the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperative motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person that was occupying the driver's seat was incapable of providing a sample of his breath and that he required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2)D.B. was the first person to come upon the accident scene. He found the accused alone in the vehicle with his seat belt on. Upon approaching the vehicle he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. The ambulance attendance and police officers arrived within a few minutes and saw the accused in the driver’s seat and with the vehicle keys in his hand. He made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer. After that, the accused made no further requests to further speak to him. 3)All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused and he wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any demand."

At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted. The proposal was deemed to be annulled. PWC was responsible for making the payments on a monthly basis and were to be distributed to the debtor's creditors. The Superintendent objected on the taxation indicating that this court should review the trustee's fee given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment.

HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of yet another and more serious assault which has lead to the accused remaining in custody for the last months.","The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release.

He is now charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September. He was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of another violent assault which is said to occur in September and another serious assault that is suspected to occur within three months. The accused submits that he will attend court on February 12, and if alcohol can be eliminated from his life that protection and safety of the public will not be an issue."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(2); and 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having retired or of any pension benefit payment arising as outlined in the Plan Contract. The applicant's request for a direct transfer did not comply with s.7.03 as the provision set out in the plan contract prohibiting the taking of any security interest under the plan. Since the applicant was not a bank director, Crown Life was not entitled to the order directing a transfer of her interest. 3)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such a provision would violate s 146(12) as well as s.8.03. 4)The application for a restraining order was denied. 5)Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired the applicant cannot establish a pension entitlement or a share in a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) unless a proper request for the transfer has been made by her.  6)Since the applicant has not been a party to the plan Contract and there has been no suggestion that Crown Life is profiting from it, it is entitled to use the proceeds of the sale of the assets in its possession to pay a pension to her or to assist in the registration of the RRIF pursuant to s.168(2). 7)Allowing the application in summary and assuming security interest at the table, that the loan agreement is similar to the security arrangements discussed in McMahon v.

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the mother. The petitioner wishes to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. The issues on the proposed relocation are whether it is in the children's best interests to relocate the child to Edmonton with the respondent; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child; if not, can the respondent relocate with the petitioner to Edmonton? HELD: 1) The child's psychological parent and psychological home is with the parent. The relationship between the child and the parent has long been recognized. The child will no longer benefit from the parent's co-parenting. 2) The respondent's current access schedule (based on the petitioner's now-retired employment and the fact that she has a roommate) is not consistent with the best interests of the children. The respondent will lose contact with his extended family in Edmonton as Charlene's move to Edmonton will cause the respondent to lose the bond he now has with Harley. 3) The evidence on the respondent's reasons for relocating to Edmonton is that the respondent has expressed an intention to have the child live with him for several months. There is no evidence that this will result in a permanent relocation of the respondent and the child will lose the psychological bond between the petitioner and Harley. 4) The applicant's plans on the child moving to Edmonton are vague. If the respondent is allowed to relocate, he will lose access to the child for extended periods of time. 5) Based on the loss of Harley as an active parent coupled with Charlene’s vague and uncertain plans for the children, what was an appropriateaccess schedule for Harley to be with the applicant? 6) The Court reviewed the various factors that may be relevant to the decision to move the child such that it was not in the best interest of the applicant to allow the relocation to Edmonton. 7) The petitioner has no means of transportation to Edmonton including the ability to access the child in person. The applicant will lose a significant psychological bond that was lost if the respondent were allowed to move to Alberta. 8) The court reviewed the respondent in Gordon v. Goertz and concluded that the petitioner would be best served to relocate to Edmonton where she would be able to contact her extended family. The court concluded that supervised access was not appropriate in the circumstances where the respondent would become an access parent and would lose the benefits of a shared parenting arrangement."

The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother. The Department had been very much involved and the decision by the Minister to make the present application was not taken in haste. The mother, who had separated from the husband and was much too irresponsible to have the care and control of all of their children, had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) since the birth of the oldest child. She had been relying on the husband for support throughout the years. He had been sentenced to prison for sexual assault, and the wife had pleaded guilty to domestic disharmony charges. HELD: The children were permanently committed to the mother. 1)An application was made under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing the mother to the father. 2)The mother was not able or unwilling to take action to protect the children. She was in denial of this or to excuse it. 3)The evidence showed that the mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children and that her failure to do so would result in further harm to the children emotionally. She did not have the competency to care for all three children on her own."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The audio evidence showed that the parties were involved in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and that the mother was mentally ill and abusive. The court found that the tapes had the opposite effect from the audio evidence as the father was adamant that he would never get an honest opinion from the children and the court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words. The tapes contained hour after hour of the father interrogating the children about the mother's parenting habits, suggesting they were being abused, prompting the children to make unfavourable comments about their mother, and suggesting the children should get out of the house and go to their father's. The tape recordings were inadmissible unless their authenticity was established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the brothers that they should become involved, found that the petitioner had failed or refused to pay the indebtedness owed to them. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due. It was common ground that the respondent had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. No adequate explanation had been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay. 2)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court to refuse to grant a receiving order.  3)As the petitioner was awealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million in his last four years as a professional hockey player in the NHL and had claimed significant tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships. He expected to derive tax advantages from being involved in them. He should be required to pay his debts."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645 and costs of $1,500. The issues on appeal were whether the defendant had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order, by varying it, to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines, and whether the trial judge had the authority to order the payment of retroactive support both before and after that date. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The jurisprudence that questions the defendant is founded on case authority that predates such authorities as the Court of Queen's Bench. Given the wording of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order, which does not direct that an adjustment should be made as of a particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal. 2) The defendant has always been able to vary his child support orders on a final order basis. In this appeal, the court relies on common law principles and does not rely on the liberalization of child support order to the extent that the defendant has now obtained a retroactive order. The court has not been asked to overrule the defendant on this issue. The defendant filed an application for variation of the 2011 variation order. It is important not to confuse the two lines of authority. The 2008 variation order varied the interim order granted December 2008. Neither the 2008 or 2011 variation orders varied the provision of the child support that the parties would endeavour to adjust annually to take into account the change in custody. 3) In light of the multiple variation orders made by the defendant in the past few years, it has become accepted that the Court in Frey held that there is no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The Court in Hall also held that the 2008 and 2009 variation orders, except for the one made under the 2006 variation order, have been in conflict with each other. 4) In the case of the defendant suing for arrears arising pursuant to a previous consent order, it is important to note that this case involved a variation of a variation order issued under the defendant's prior agreement in accordance with the parties' agreement and not under the terms of that consent order. 5) In this case, the defendant failed to comply with his financial information obligations by failing to find any unreasonable delay."

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found guilty of both charges. 1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There was no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the defendant. This was threatening behaviour and the defendant said he felt threatened. As the complainant said in his testimony, the defendant was not there to apologize. The accused both admitted to breaking the front passenger window and breaking the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. There being no evidence of an essential element of the offence, the Court found the accused not guilty of the second count on information 24414281. 2) The Court found both accused guilty of assault upon the complainant.

c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal was dismissed as there was ample evidence which supported the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the appellant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt."

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms.

The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services).

b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal a decision dismissing its summary judgment application. The chambers judge found that the plaintiff had met the test for summary judgment and then that the plaintiffs met the onus on them to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The affidavit was severely deficient and did not comply with the law in Nova Scotia respecting the form and contents of affidavits. 2)The affidavits of the defendants' lawyer and the Chambers judge were all found to be inadmissible. 3)The Chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test. The affidavit was unnecessary to consider the second step. 4)All of the evidence referred to in the chambers decision was considered. 5)The plaintiff did not have to prove the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit.  6)The onus was not on the plaintiff to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit."

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The father was ordered to pay maintenance for himself under the Family Maintenance Act. The mother was granted interim shared custody.

He had previously filed an answer and counter-petition in January 2013 contesting the mother's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The petitioner argued that the parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that the father would have sole custody and supervised access of the mother and the father for a period of time. She alleged that this did not provide sufficient protection for the child as he was in constant pain and would not be able to get out of bed at night. HELD: 1) The evidence from the mother who had custody of the child at the time of the original application was that her son had been kept from her for two weeks. She telephoned the father the next morning principally to try and get the child out of the father’s house. 2) There was nothing wrong with the state of mind of the petitioner. The child had a normal life, lived with his mother every afternoon and sometimes went to sleep with her. 3) The father had access to the computer and the Internet. 4) The parties’ communication was limited by the fact that the child had not seen his mother for two months. 5) The parents were unable to contact each other for several days because of the restrictions placed upon them by the father. 6) The child was not able to participate in activities with his father. The parents’ inability to contact him during the day resulted in a lack of communication with each other. There was a high level of hostility between the parties that resulted in the imposition of conditions upon the father such that his access was limited to one day per week for six months. There were a number of incidents that led the father to believe that he was abandoning the child and that the mother needed to end the relationship."

The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price.

Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.

Counsel for the respondent took issue with the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of the judgment of November had ever been issued. 4)An order requiring the respondent to return the list of items referred to above as well as any outstanding liability payments and any losses experienced as a result of no insurance coverage between September 28 1993 and December 29 1993. 5)The respondent was ordered not to dispose of any of the said items without leave of Court.  6)The balance of the issues was that the respondent had taken great number of assets with him.

b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered at their expense the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff later retained new counsel, who represented him at trial. At trial the Crown alleged that the plaintiff should have objected to the admission into evidence of the police officer's opinion on the stopping distance as it was based on a stationary Chrysler theory. The defence argued that the video re-enactment and related photos did not accurately depict the scene at the time of the collision and that the evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. HELD: The appeal court held that it would have been reasonable exercise of judgment if the video had been admitted into evidence and the still photographs had been admissible. The court found that the R.C.M.P. analyst's opinion was highly prejudicial and, together with the inference that the Crown's methodology in creating the video was unfair, it should have been objected to by way of pre-trial motion and during trial. However, the video and the photographs were all admissible and the issue of the defendant's competency in representing the plaintiff was not raised during the appeal."
c_2006skpc93.txt,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance.

The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S., Ch. 11 as amended and states that the Plaintiff's only possible claim is for workers compensation benefits from the WCC. The Defendant further states the Claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. SaskTel was awarded costs."
d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude them. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Charter; whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence leading to such a demand; and whether the certificate of analysis could be relied upon to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. HELD: The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. Based upon the evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle, the Court was persuaded that the words 'has alcohol in your body' were insufficient to determine that the police officer had the reasonable suspicion that the accused motorist had consumed alcohol. Based on the previous admission by the accused that she consumed alcohol, together with the other evidence he had on hand, he believed he was justified in making the breath demand. The Court was also persuaded that there was insufficient evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, which was also a Charter breach."

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent did not have to pay retroactive child support and that the petitioner’s position on the matter was not blameworthy.

The parties had agreed upon a division of the Canada Child Tax Benefit and GST, the manner in which the tax credits were calculated and the amount of special and/or extraordinary costs which were borne by the petitioner. 2)The respondent had not breached his or her 2003 agreement with respect to monthly child support. 3)The petitioner had not engaged in blamed conduct. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice' as set out in the DBS definition. 4)The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum were not so significant that the mother would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children.  5)A material change in circumstance did not permit the court to pursue the application for a variation of the child support ordered in the years 2002 to 2003.  6)The court was required to draw any improper or unwarranted inferences from the evidence."

Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant and not the driver of the white Tempo, this would have been the situation six years earlier. It was open to the jury to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver. 3) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was undercut by numerous considerations. The R.C.M.P. sergeant who was in the patrol car with the appellant testified that he had seen the appellant driving the Tempo and that he was not convinced the appellant had been involved in the grow-op.

The defendant appealed the assessment decision and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upholding the utility and review board's assessment. In September 1997, HRM issued a property tax refund cheque to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia court upheld the reduced assessment but in March 1997, the Utility and Review Board upheld the assessment determination. Within five months, the assessment was reduced and this had the ramification of an overpayment when the taxes were recalculated. HRM earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. It sought to recover the overpayment as soon as it could. HELD: 1)The Judicial Act does not create debt. There was no right to a full refund of overpaid taxes until the disposition of any appeal of the assessment. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75) is an appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the hearing of the Assessment decision in March/97 and the payment of the property tax refunds in September/98 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment.  2)Costs of the appeal were calculated using the date the plaintiff paid the taxes until March 1997. 3)There was no cause of action for return of any overpayment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted.

He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment, the Crown stayed counts and granted a credit of two for one for the full remand time. The accused pled guilty to three counts. The sentences were imposed: COUNT 2 incarceration for two years and three months consecutive to the preceding sentences; COUNT 3 Incarceration of 1 year and 6 months, concurrent with the previous sentences; and COUNT 4 Incorporation for one year and six months, both of which were concurrent to the new sentences. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The accused was sentenced to four years and nine months and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly. 1) The offence was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offences were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. The place from which the crimes originated was a place that had no effect on the accused. 2) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is more important is the dollar value of the goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted. 3) The gravity of the offences is very high. There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several other people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued many times and involved hundreds of transactions and many individuals. 4) The credit remains with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. 5) The Court must strive to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: denounce unlawful conduct; to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; to separate offenders from society, where necessary; to assist in rehabilitation; to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and to promote sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm inflicted. To do so it must be with a priority. Denunciation and deterrence, both accused and others, must be emphasized and obtain a priority; any other approach would be counterproductive."
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Chambers judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The learned judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. He also held that the respondent had priority over the other claimants based on the dates of registration. Allowing the appeal and ordering the payment of the sum to the Eskasoni Band, that the failure of the respondent to give notice to the Band in August 1991 was grounds for an Interpleader."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location and destroyed the plaintiff's building. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The defendant moved out of the building in May of 2010 and moved to a new location. The plaintiff sought production of all documents relating to the second fire. Specifically: a complete copy of any investigative files prepared by government authorities including the Fire Marshall and the Town of Stellarton Fire Department; any photographs of the aftermath of the fire; any internal investigation, any of the file of any insurers who carried out investigations; and all of the relevant documents. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings 2 years apart did not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating the second blaze."
e_2004skca31.txt,"This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, I decline to do so for these reasons. The Court of Appeal has not lifted the stay and, in light of the fact that the chambers judge did not have the authority to make such an order, the decision parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, on an interim basis prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift it, and to maintain the schedule existing prior to its decision under appeal. Accordingly, the parties are to be governed by the order of Wright J. unless otherwise agreed and until further order.

5_2009nssc218.txt,"The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar. He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings committed in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The two accused remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. HELD: The sentence is one of years, months incarceration.  1) An aggravating factor is that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The offender was acquitted of the two counts and he is not being sentenced for those offences today. 2) Another aggravating factors is that a bullet found its way into an occupied residence across the road from the after-hours bar. There was a serious threat to the safety and security of those living in that residence as well as those who were congregated on the outside porch of the bar shortly before the shooting. The accused had been prohibited from possessing firearms in the area where the shootings occurred. The evidence in the present case points to the presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired at him. The defendant possessed a firearm at the time of the offence and used it to commit the offence. The presence of 2 handguns were found to be a significant mitigating factor in the trial.  3) The defendant had a prior criminal record for non-violent offences such as fraud, possession of a controlled substance and careless storage of a weapon. While he was on bail, the defendant did not accept responsibility for the offence, as he had served 17 months in pre- trial custody and was not a youthful offender."
b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The first issue before the court arises from the voir dire and concerns whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the warrant to search for blood samples issued pursuant to s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure is invalid. The warrant was invalid and there was a breach of the accused’s s.8 rights. The officer who signed the information to compel, when reviewed as a whole, did not provide sufficient detail to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds for the warrant were not present. The Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were admitted into evidence at trial. The Crown and accused agreed that the officer who swore the information should testify on voir de for the purpose of the Court making the determination of the validity of the search warrant and the admissibility of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The affidavit to compel was not sufficient to warrant a search warrant. It was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant and there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253. The Court held that it was of the view that the information which the officer had deposed in the Information To Obtain did not constitute reasonable ground for the belief that the person who had been driving the vehicle at the time of the accident was the driver of the vehicle. Further, the officer did not depose that he believed the accused was the only person in the vehicle who was not wearing a seat belt when he applied for the warrants. Even if it is established that information contained within the affidavit is inaccurate, or that material fact was not disclosed, this will not necessarily detract from the existence of the statutory pre-conditions. The likelihood that the proposed challenge will have an impact is dependent on the particular factual context.  1) The officer swore his information to obtain. The factual material presented by the officer was not supported by the evidence at the hearing. 2) There was a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make a full answer and that the cross- examination could elicit relevant and material evidence of probative value that may discredit the credibility of the source of his belief. There was no basis upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the relevant statutory prerequisites of s. 256 of the Criminal Code existed. 3) There were witnesses at the scene of the crash. The accused was found to be unconscious."
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, which held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could be varied after payment. For the appellant and the respondent, that there was a jurisdictional question concerning the payment of lump sum in 1985 which had been raised by the respondent. The matter had been adjourned for several months and the appellant then applied for variation of the order in 1993. The respondent had made no further payment since that time and had not had contact with the child. In 1993 the appellant made an application for variation under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act, which required the respondent to pay lying in expenses in the amount of $209 and periodic payments for support of $100 and $100 in the alternative lump sum of $7,500 be paid by the 14th day of October 1985 together with lying-in expenses of $208. The applicant sought to have the order varied, rescinded or suspended, and a judge may vary, rescind or suspend the order on the basis that the circumstances have changed. Levy held a pre-trial conference at which time the respondent raised the jurisdictional issue, arguing the payment in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support. Levy adjourned the matter for a further time and did not consider the merits of the application. He then wrote a decision returning the appeal to the county court for reconsideration. The parties were entitled to know as soon as possible what the judge's decision would be. Allowing the appeal, that the court could not collaterally substitute the reference in the statute to the County Court. Further, since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for reference in statute to that county court."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military and applied for a pension. The Minister of Defence later reversed the decision and the plaintiff was barred from bringing an action for damages against the government claiming that she was wrongly or arbitrarily released. In this action, the Crown brought an application to strike the plaintiff's statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The defence of the Crown in part argued that the plaintiff had not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Pensions Act or the Queen's Regulations and Orders, nor had she pursued the administrative process in favour of pursuing the civil action. Arguing that the Crown has not met the onus on proving that a pension is payable and that, in the alternative, a decision to bar the plaintiff from bringing such an action could only be made in light of s. 111 of the Pension Act and s. 2 of the Liability and Proceedings Act. The Crown took the position that to interpret the section as imposing an obligation on the employee to apply for pension, and further obligation upon him to prove that pension is not payable, would require the plaintiff to read into the legislation concepts which are both unexpressed and unreasonable. The plaintiff failed to bring this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time. It was inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now precluded from bringing this proceeding. Furthermore, the limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired under the pension act. To interpret the s. 11(1) of the Act (and s. 8) (where pension is or may be awarded) as a bar to the proceedings has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to the present instance."

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990, an assessment was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded in January 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s.7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that s.2(4) is a supplementary provision to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax. It is a provision which, if enacted, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's claim for compensation based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study that there might be an entitlement to benefits. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The justice of waiving the six-month limitation period involves an examination of the reasons for the delay and the substantive merits of the claim.  2)Section 45(1)(b) of the Act states that if there is no evidence to show the cause of death, it is presumed that the death was the result of an injury arising out of and in the course of the work. Section 45(3) does not bar the Board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board' at the time of the deceased's death. 3)The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard. 4)Section 47(1) is not to bar the board from making policy that enable it to carry out its statutory mandate.

The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration.","FIAT: The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act, 1992. The plaintiff was a chartered accountant. He joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement in 1999. In 1999, MNP gave notice to the plaintiff that his partnership arrangement would be terminated effective September 30, 2009. On May 10, 2011, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the C.E.O., which served as formal notice to Laidlaw that he required his dispute with Meyers Norris Penny LLP to be referred to arbitration. In November 2011 the plaintiff commenced claim against MNP. Relevant portions of the claim are: 6. Effective September 1, 2000, LaidLaw was admitted as a principal partner of the MNP, subject to terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The partnership agreement provided for the courts to stay the action if there was a conflict between the agreement and the merger agreement.

7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance. The Court held that it was not appropriate to have the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. The issues were: 1) an application for divorce; 2) an order to vary the existing parenting arrangements; and 3) the petitioner's application for an additional day to allow the parties, through the petitioner, to have a hearing on the issues of child and child arrears brought by the respondent. The parties had been separated for in excess of 1 year and were trying to come to an agreement on parenting arrangements. The respondent was uncertain as to the plans and the need for a full-time nanny. The petitioner had consulted with the respondent and been advised that her ongoing potty training was not an issue for her to be able to attend the program. HELD: There was no reason for the Court to delay the implementation of the child's birth certificate or any of the other parenting arrangements until the matter had been resolved. The child was in the best interests of his or her parents at this stage."
4_1994canlii5048.txt,"The Crown elected to proceed summarily and the accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of assault under S.266 of the Code. He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for a period of 18 months on certain specific conditions. A 10 year firearm, ammunition and explosive substance prohibition order was made against the appellant pursuant to s. 100(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused appealed the sentence. He had now served 15 days of the sentence and had commenced serving the noted sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence was too severe. The court reduced the term of imprisonment imposed to 6 months and maintained the 18 month probation order subject only to amending the time within which the appellant was to report to the chief probation officer as therein provided. 2)In these circumstances the appellant could not seriously oppose a reduction of said sentence to time already served. 3)Having regard for the five elements of protection of society, thepunishment, general and specific deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice, the Court allowed the appeal against the 6-month term imposed at trial from 6 months to 1 month and maintained an 18 months probation order."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. All jurisdictional elements have been proven. The father agreed to the terms of the separation agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. There was no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. 2) The parties entered into a separation agreement which purported to settle all matters between them and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement in this matter. 3) The agreement was not varied under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act or treated like an ordinary variation that occurs when circumstances change relating to support orders. There is nothing that would allow the Court to intervene if at all in the division of the property."
3_2003skpc14.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)). The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate it was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence was to the effect that when stopped by the police he was suffering from a panic attack. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.) or that his evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. 2)Although the accused testified that he was into his panic attack, his evidence as to when he was in the throws of it did not raise a sufficient doubt as a possibility of him being in such an attack."
d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she had prepared for her appeal. At the time of the appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal in the Provincial Court naming only Her Majesty the Queen and Queen's Counsel as respondents to the appeal and to have the respondents pay for the preparation and certification of the transcript; in the meantime, she had applied for an extension of time to appeal these decisions. The respondents' motions to dismiss both appeals were granted. The appellant's motion to consolidate both appeals was dismissed for failure to perfect. The court found there was no merit to the argument that the appellant could not provide certified transcripts given that no dates had been set for the filing of the required materials and, in the hearing of her appeal, because of the appellant's seeming inability to comply on timely basis with the Rules. It would be unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at or near.08. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he did not do. 3)Although the accused's response in stopping was delayed and he braked abruptly, the officer noted that it was windy, windy and he might not normally signal when he was aware of emergency lights. 4)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused. 5)The court found that the accused had not displayed any symptoms of impairment other than the smell of alcohol. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. He was cooperative and appeared to be in good spirits. 6)The evidence of impairment alleged by the Crown must be considered in the context of the principles contained in R. v. Stellato (1994), 31 C.R. (4th) 60, in which the Supreme Court of Canada approved the following conclusions: 'The Crown must prove its evidence is credible'. The Court found that there was nothing of note either in the timing of the stop, the manner of braking, the braking and the failure indicated recent marijuana use. The accused suggested that his eyes may have been the result of the alcohol consumption on the day of the offence. However, there was no medical evidence to support this conclusion.  7)The only evidence offered by the police was that they had not conducted any field sobriety tests (e.g. the horizontal gaze nystagmus, the vertical gaze test, the heel and toe) and the Romberg test (which were inconclusive and did not offer a reasonable explanation for their absence. 8)There was no evidence of any impairment by alcohol on the evidence."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. The motion concerned an extension of the trial date which would have occurred after the outside disposition date. HELD: The Court has not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and the trial will commence tomorrow. 1) reapprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the Act (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2) of the Act. 2)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem. The court has jurisdiction to conduct a trial."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with a number of offences, including robbery, and possession of a gun. The police stopped the car and found the accused in it, minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and the gun and brass knuckles. At the time of the police stop, the accused was sitting in the car with the other accused. The accused was not at the scene of the robbery, had not been picked up on the way to the court, nor had he provided any evidence about what happened in the house where the robbery took place. HELD: The accused’s involvement in the robbery was ruled out. The circumstantial evidence at this point was piling up and it was logical to infer that the people found in the vehicle when it was stopped by the police were the people who got out of the car when it left Sackville. The court found that the circumstances in the case were more than suspicious given that the accused had a hand gun and was sitting directly in front of the accused and that she did not stop to pick up any of the people she had picked up. There was an opportunity for the accused to demonstrate that he was not involved with the robbery. The Court found that because the accused clearly saw the people he described and was able to identify them, the evidentiary gap could not be closed. The Crown had proven that it had a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused committed the robbery or if he was the mastermind behind the crime."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was found not guilty on all of the counts. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood sold to the undercover officer was wood coming from Crown lands. Therefore, the conviction should be quashed. The Court of Queen's Bench stated that it was not satisfied that during the period the defendant harvested wood from Crown land and sold it to an undercover officer, that he should not have taken this as an admission, as it was inconsistent with the evidence established."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel found that the IDSL, as amended by the MIDSL, did not impose an obligation on HAL to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. Accordingly, HAL's application for leave was dismissed. HELD: The application was dispositive. The terms of the agreements, although not specifically referring to a right of appeal on such a basis, contain an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal arbitrators' decisions, with leave, on any questions of law, even those conferred by statute. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or to the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. 1)HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators’ decision, because it would be contrary to the intended result. 2)The agreements signed with HAL and SecurTek did not provide the right to obtain leave to appealed on a question of law. The agreements set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. The meaning of the word 'arbitration' in the agreement was clear and unambiguous, and the parties intentionally “contracted out” of it. 3)The implied term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express intent of the parties. 4)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible. The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would occur was intentional. The parties did not intended to allow an appeal on that very narrow issue. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording. The degree of generality of the generality (precedential value) of the words used in the arbitration clause and the phrase 'Arbitrators decision will be final' (emphasis added) should conclude that the parties intended to permit an appeal. 5)The arbitration panel did not find that the ability of HAL to appeal on a 'final and binding' nature of the arbitration clauses was not inadvertent, but intentional. They did not intend to exclude all rights of appeal, except on the narrow issue of whether the arbitration panel’s decision would be final. 6)The agreement was not patently binding."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's window. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of Metal and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The plaintiff argued that the experts' reports did not support the claim and that the plaintiff should have taken more time to prepare and obtain the necessary documentation to prove her claim was not tainted by negligence. HELD: The defendant had met the threshold test and the onus of proving negligence was not on the trial judge. There was no genuine issue for trial and the plaintiff failed to adduce evidence to support the bare allegation made in the pleadings. 1)The claim had no real chance of success as the plaintiff had testified that she had seen the object that she drove over which flew from beneath her vehicle and caused her to swerve in avoidance of it hitting his windshield. She lost control and was hit by an oncoming van. 2)The evidence presented by the experts was not bare allegation, but a material fact that if accepted at trial would have given the plaintiff a real chance to succeed. 3)The plaintiff's pleadings were not bare allegations and the facts were not in dispute. 4)There must be a real distinction or difference of evidence requiring the court to make a determination of credibility.  5)No trial judge or jury properly instructed would make a finding of negligence against a defendant driver, having considered the body of evidence before them. No case law could be made to justify a finding where there was no evidence of negligence. The only conclusion drawn from the expert reports was that the piece had been dangling from the defendant's tractor trailer prior to the plaintiff being hit by the same piece of wood.  6)Costs in the summary judgment judgment proceedings were ordered to be paid by the parties."

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina, breasts and buttocks numerous times over top of her clothing. He also touched her inappropriately in the bedroom. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)There was reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The complainant's evidence was disbelieved. There was no credible evidence that he sexually assaulted or harassed the complainant. The circumstantial evidence was that he was drunk. He was not known to work outside the home. It was reasonable to expect that he would be guilty of some of the offences alleged. 2)The absence of any complaint by the complainant to her mother might be consistent with her fear that she would leave and take the baby with him but the lack of complaint is also consistent with his innocence. 3)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. The accused is not guilty of either charge. Although there is reasonable doubt surrounding his guilt and the allegations surrounding his behaviour, it is beyond the reasonable doubt that he did not do what he was accused of doing. 4)There is no evidence of his dangerous or defamatory behaviour. The Crown did not prove it. The facts were not in dispute. 5)Although there was reasonable evidence surrounding his alleged acts of sexual assault and touching, it was not enough to convict him of his crimes."

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. The evidence from the father's witnesses differed materially from that given by the mother. HELD: Custody and access were granted to the father with a review date. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses was credible and the information concerning the mother's contributions to the children's education was not. The court found that although the mother had not always been as respectful of the father during the marriage, she had not convinced me that the set-off amount was inappropriate given the childrens needs when living in her household. 1) The evidence indicated that the father would not seek to renegotiate the arrangement or change the way the children were cared for. 2) There was no evidence that the parties would suffer irreparable harm if a shared arrangement were entered into. 3) The father was to pay $502 per month for child care and Taekwondo expenses. Section of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was considered and the set off was appropriate. 4) The mother was to receive a setoff amount of $502.5 per month. The formula used in this decision was based on the best interests of the parties and could not be taken as an excuse for deterioration in his communication and behaviour. Spousal support was not included in the calculation of child support table. 5) The information was credible. 6) There were no significant differences between the parties."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of seven offences relating to careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result. He also contended the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. In his appeal, the Crown argued that the appellant was a flight risk because he had no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report and had been on bail for 16 months without incident. The appellant proposed to be released on the basis that he had complied with the terms of his release in the eight months since he was found guilty, but the sentencing judge found that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded gun to the door in all the circumstances. HELD: The appellant was granted release on the terms set out in R. v. Renacci (1993), 86 C.C.C.; and 95(2)(a)(1) offences. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for each count, followed by a conditional sentence of three years and a fine of $340,000. The court found that the offences were very serious and the appellant had a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. The circumstances that the Crown suggested made the appellant a risk to public safety had nothing to do with the charges he had faced or the convictions that have resulted. The offences were clearly foreseeable and clearly foreseeable. The applicant was not flight risk."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the order that accompanied the notice in the matter. It was requested that the submissions in writing on the matter of costs be provided by February 16, 2011."
b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time. 2)This can quite properly occur by the application to exclude evidence of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application of s.24 remedy, if any."
8_1986canlii706.txt,"Division of matrimonial property. Husband owned farm land at the time of the marriage. During the marriage he spent heavily on booze and drugs. Wife spent her savings and employment income on the farming operation and family expenses. Held: Inequitable and unfair to exempt value of farm land from matrimonial assets. Equal division ordered, to be paid in installments secured against the land. Husband ordered to pay maintenance for support of the children.","The parties entered into a decree dissolving the marriage in 1982 and reserved judgment on the issues of maintenance, costs and division of matrimonial property. Although the applicant claimed spousal maintenance in her petition, her counsel indicated she was willing to withdraw her claim if she was awarded an equal share of the property. HELD: 1)The evidence presented by the applicant was uncontested. There were no exceptions, exemptions or equitable considerations that would make an equal distribution unfair or inequitable. 2)The lis pendens registered as item 84-S-26535 would be vacated. 3)The respondent was to pay maintenance of $250 for each child, continuing on the first day of each succeeding month for so long as each child remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 4)Even if I knew the net value of the farmland at the date of the marriage, it would be unfair and inequitable to exempt that value from distribution."
4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made in May 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties divorced in 1998. The petitioner mother had the use of his father's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam. When she returned in August 2006, Michael began living with his mother. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Michael resumed living with the mother and was supported by his grandmother. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly causes their children. 2)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is necessary that there be a shared parenting regime in place, it is not necessary that the parties live together for the foreseeable future. The father is not above the threshold provided for in s. 9. 3)Sole custody arrangements and s. 7 expenses are to be determined by taking into account the increased costs associated with the shared custody arrangements; any other health related expense, the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and child for whom support is sought. 4)The father is entitled to costs in the amount of $500. 5)In this case, the mother's income is $25,672.37 and the father's proportionate share is 80% of that amount, or $3,408.80. The current s. expenses total $4,261.00 yearly.  6)The mother does not bring an application to vary child support upward. It is not practical to order that the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. Two incidents illustrate why not. In the fall of 2006 the mother paid for dental appointment for Jessica and submitted the charge to the father’s insurer for reimbursement. The Father refused to provide signed insurance forms to the mother, notwithstanding a clear direction to do so in the fiat of M-E Wright J.  7."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","A summary conviction appeal from a judgment in September 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were: 1) the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count in convicting the appellant; 2) the trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence of the central Crown witness as he provided exculpatory evidence; and 3) the appellant did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. The trial judge was in better position to judge the appellant's credibility on the issue of his intention than the SCAC judge or this court, who must rely on the written record."

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12.

The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the defendant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and leave to him to commence derivative action in the name of the company for alleged misdeeds of the defendants. The defendant had previously been a director at the defendant company. He had left in 2003 and was involved in a cause of action in defamation against the defendant. In 2004, the defendant resigned from the company and the defendant commenced a derivative action against the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought this action in response to the defendant's failure to disclose certain allegations in his statement of claim. At the shareholder meeting, Oickle's admissions were withdrawn and he applied for leave to amend his defence. He argued that the judge erred in using the less restrictive test used in the Act. He allowed the application to withdraw the admissions and added the claim for a 'oppressive remedy' which was not retroactive. The judge granted leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence on which the defendant could conclude there was a triable issue as disclosed in the admissions. There were no errors or omissions by the defendant on the issue of the first ground. The second ground of appeal was that the defendant had not been given proper weight to the lack of temporal connection between the time over which Oickle owned shares of the Company and the acts of oppression and that he was a senior and/or key employee who owed fiduciary duties."

In this case, the Crown did not cite any other case law cited in the decision; all of which should have been appealed, were dismissed with costs in the amount of $6,000 to the appellant; and 4) the appeal was not allowed on the basis that the Court had refused to exercise its discretion in making a proper direction on the application."
2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been placed in the care of the psychological father because of instability in the home, the risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child, and that there was a risk of the child suffering harm as a result of the father's repeated threats to take the child from her. The psychological father argued that he did not wish to see the child taken into custody and that he would not allow the mother to have any contact with him. HELD: The child remained in the agency's custody pursuant to the protection order provided by the court. She was to have supervised visits with her daughter and a hearing was scheduled for September 15, 2005. 1)The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was clearly on the Agency. It was a civil burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. 2)The child had a long history of involvement with the father. She had taken the child into care because of problems with her environment, her anger at her mother, her repeated moves, her lack of supervision and her unwillingness to take steps to improve her relationship with her children. 3)The biological father was to continue to provide support and counselling to the mother. 4)The mother was to provide counselling to her daughter. 5)She was to complete anger management counselling with a psychologist. 6)The father's attendance at a risk management conference was discussed. 7)Allowing the application in its entirety, that the agency had failed to protect the child and failed to provide the child with the necessities of life, namely a safe place for her to sleep, a shower and food.  8)The agency was required to pay the father a fair price for the services provided. 9)Costs were not included in the costs of the application."

At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s.9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The Crown objected and the accused waived his right to a fair trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant waived or part of it such that the remainder is not unreasonable. 3)There is no evidence that institutional delay of 13 months is the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of a breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss.8 and s9 charter motions and leads evidence to the contrary, the Court is asked to infer prejudice. 4)Prejudice to the accused may be inferred. The length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed. 5)There could be no greater frustration imaginable for innocent persons charged with an offence than to be denied the opportunity of demonstrating their innocence for an unconscionable time as result of unreasonable delays in their trial."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the Gold Key Lease has none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Issues #2 and #3 were whether the lease agreement was actually a rental contract pursuant to s.62 of the Act, and whether Chrysler was vicarious liable for any negligence attributed to Giffin. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge did not err in finding that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case. The reverse onus provision simply does not apply.  2) The complex legal issues arose out of disputed facts and the appropriate inferences and legal consequences to be drawn from them were found.  3) The relationship between the law of vicarious liability and the automobile and its owner was unambiguously determined by the precedents.  4) The lease agreement did not fit within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62. 5) The insurer was not a party to the motion or on this appeal.  6) In a non-employer/employee relationship, the court reviewed Bazley v. Eikelenboom (1999) and found that the common law, particularly s. 2(ak), has a similar effect."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.",The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and with aggravated assault contrary to ss. 249(1)(a). HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The court found no evidence of a consensual fight between the accused and the complainant. The evidence that the accused assaulted the complainant and kicked her in the face was overwhelming. The court concluded that the relationship was consensual. 2) The accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown proven the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the counts. The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. 3) The offence was proved where the Crown established that the driving complained of was dangerous to public.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act.  1)It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time that the parents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia, the child is to have his access time with the father for the remainder of August. The mother acknowledged this to be the case.  2)The evidence was insufficient.

c_1995canlii5671.txt,"The Mother applied to vary the custody provisions of the decree nisis for divorce which provided for joint custody of the parties' 2 children, aged 11 and 9 years. Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father. A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had filed an application to vary the judgment in order to give joint custody of the boys to the mother or joint custody with principal residence with the father. HELD: 1)The mother was granted custody with generous access.  2)The father's reasons for moving to Ontario were not unreasonable if the course he wishes to take was not offered at the Dental College of the University of Saskatchewan. The alternative being to have the boys move away from Saskatchewan where their roots were and where their extended family lives and of course where the mother and her husband live. 3)The evidence showed that the father had devoted his entire life to providing care and attention to the children. The fact that he was able to access the children from his home in Regina and the fact that the mother had generous access in the summer led to the conclusion that this was a material and significant change in the children's lives. 4)The offer of generous access was not considered in light of the huge number of people filing applications in Ontario. 5)It was reasonable to expect that an incident of custody included the determination by the custodial parent of where the parent and child shall live and provisions for possible access in Hawaii if the mother wished to move.  6)No order as to costs."
e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the application was prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of the Court of Appeal. The proposed appellants had applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Courtof Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. They argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, which states that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those akin to those before him. They also argued that evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. Dismissing the application, that while there was some common issue affecting the manner in which the opinions were filed, they did not establish a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c) of the Class Actions Act, and therefore were not grounds to dismiss the application. Further, no case law or analysis was required in the context of all evidence that may come before the Court during trial."

2001skqb485.txt,"The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics. She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir de dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police must be able to conclude that there were indeed reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest. The restriction that the search must be 'truly incidental'to the arrest means that the policemust be attempting to achieve some valid purpose connected to that arrest. Whether such an objective exists will depend on what the Crown were looking for and why. 1) Searches must be authorized by law. If the Crown is relying for authorization is the common law doctrine of search incident to arrest, then the limits of this doctrine must be respected. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the court concluded there were not, they were of a minor nature and certainly not sufficiently egregious to engage the provisions of s. 24(2) of the charter. 2) To exclude the evidence in question would, in fact, bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The actions of the police were not unlawful with respect to either the arrest or search and seizure. The arrest and seizure were incidental and therefore, not unlawful. 3) The bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence, which must be considered in light of the suggestion that the evidence should be excluded under s.24(2). The reasonable expectation of privacy concept has worked well in Canada. It has provided to be reasonable, flexible and viable and should not be abandoned in favour of the principles of automatic standing. 4) Requiring the search be truly incidental to an arrest means the officers must be conducting a valid search. Those grounds must, in addition, be justifiable from an objective point of view. The Crown contends that the expungement of the evidence pursuant to sec. 8(2)(a) and s. 25(3) must be met in order to establish prima facie case for conviction.  5) The court concluded the accused had no reasonable expectation for privacy in her own home. She had nothing else in her possession or in the apartment.  6)"

It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for child support purposes is $59,500 gross per annum. In December 2002, Justice Dickson terminated the respondent's obligation to pay support for the parties' oldest child, Corry and ordered that in addition to ongoing support for two youngest children, the payment of s. 8 expenses was also terminated. The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses.  2) In September 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated the petitioner's obligation for support for Kristin and Corry. He found that Corry's income would normally be $30,000 gross per year and the mother's income to be less. He ordered the respondent to pay 66% of the s.7 expenses. In September 2004, Justice Wilkinson of this Court granted a consent order extending the respondent’s s.8 expenses for the 2005/06 university year. The costs relating to the computer were legitimate s7 costs. The student loans were covered by Table support.

8_2003nspc17.txt,"The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid. Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore that the warrant should not have issued; that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: The evidence was compelling and the application should have been granted. 1) There was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of the warrant. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. 2) The existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence were all relevant. However, rather than being a separate test, the test must be met to determine whether the evidence met the standard of reasonableness. Weaknesses in one area may be compensated by strengths in the other. 3) The nature of the evidence, over all, was compelling. The officer did not stand in the same place and function as the authorizing judge. He or she did not conduct rehearing for the application. This is the starting place for any reviewing judge. If, based on the record, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorization judge could have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere."

Dismissing the appeal, that the Board had correctly interpreted its jurisdiction and made findings amply supported by the evidence arising from the de novo hearing. Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant applied for criminal injuries compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act.

He appealed to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board, which dismissed the appellant's appeal.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to ss. 8 and 9. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of Kyle's trial. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1) The accused's Charter application in relation to the cell phone did not associate him with the phone and entitles him at trial to demand that the Crown prove the phone is his. 2) The essential issue on the firearms and ammunition seized from the accused was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, the loaded Cooey 84 shotgun, and the two over-capacity magazines. 3) Pursuant to the accused's s. 8 Charter application, the accused did not have a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor did he have valid registration certificate for any of the firearms."

In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considered the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00 for the respondent. Given the respondent's income and the petitioner's failure to take effective effective notice that she was seeking spousAL support in the past three years, the Court decided that retroactive spousals should be left to final adjudication and not be granted upon an interim application for child support. HELD: 1)The court gave the respondent three months' notice leading up to the filing of the within application for interim spielal support of $700.00 per month.  2)The respondent was 61 years old. His regular hourly rate of pay is $28.50. The petitioner argued that he could not keep up the pace of working overtime hours as he did in previous years. The respondent earned rental income from leasing farm land and the net rental income after payment of property taxes yields $8,000. Given his state of health the court will not compel the respondent to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. 3)The petitioner did not seek any form of corollary relief pursuant to s.5 and s.6 of the D.B.S.C. 1985, c. F-6.2. The evidence established that the respondent’s gross income in the year 2013 to his pay period ending December 14, 2013 was $95,275.73.

At the age of 61, given his health and given the petitioner indicated that he intended to work a standard 40 hour week by the rate of $28,50. This represents an annual income of $59,280. 5)It was also found in the context of the SSAG that the petitioner failed to provide effective notice of the date of separation to which the respondent was to apply for interim support.  6)The SAGEG as a guide only was used and the court ordered the respondent not to exceed $700 per month except in exceptional circumstances."

The respondent contested that the petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings and lacked jurisdiction or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. Both parties made serious allegations against the other and there was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence. HELD: An order for interim custody was granted on the condition the petitioner continued to reside with his parents in Regina and that the child not be removed from Regina without further court order. 1)The respondent did not acquiesce to the child's residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was habitually resident here for the purposes of the Children's Law Act.  2)The seven factors listed in s15(1)(b) are conjunctive and the petitioner must satisfy them all. With respect to (iii) a petition for divorce was commenced in July 1996. 3)The child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to s15(1)(b). Jurisdiction existed pursuant to s15(3) as the child had a closer connection to Saskatchewan then to Alberta. Both sets of grandparents and other family members on both sides reside in Saskatchewan. The child had no connection of consequence to the Province of Alberta.,FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his only child born in 1996. Section of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the father. 1)The child had no connection of consequence to Alberta and the Court lacked jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. 2)The father had consented to or acquiesced in the child residing in Saskatchewan and the court had jurisdiction pursuant to s.15(1)(b) as the childclearly had a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta. 3)The court found jurisdiction under ss.15 and 1(3)as the child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan. As a result the court has jurisdiction under s. 15(1(b). 4)In the event that there was a change in the petitioner's residence the matter was brought back before the Court for review. It was a condition that the child shall not be removed from the city of Regina without further order from the Court.
b_2002nspc32.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit and impaired driving. After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was charged with impaired driving and impaired driving. Witnesses testified that the defendant lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill near the fire hall. The defendant was the lone occupant and the only person present at the scene at the time of the accident. The police officer testified that he heard the defendant make a demand for blood samples and that he smelled the defendant's vehicle when it hit the shoulder and left the road. Blood demand acceded to and preceded by the usual Charter rights to counsel. The defence argued that the Crown should not rely on the defence's claim of a failure to detect signs of intoxication. HELD: The accused was granted s. 10(v) Charter rights at time when he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and gave an informed waiver as required by R. v. Baig.  1)The accused demonstrated an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. 2)His level of alertness may have been fluctuating but his emotions were stable. He displayed an appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking. 3)There was no evidence of mechanical defects or mechanical defects in the defendant’s vehicle.  4)Although it may be tempting to jump from amnesia to conclusion that he was unable to understand the events subsequently forgotten, there is no absolute protection against lack of appreciation of the information conveyed. The fulfilment of the informational component of the right to counsel does not hinge on whether the detainee understood the communication but whether the essential elements of the Right were adequately communicated. The correlative duty on the police to inform the detainee of his right to retain and instruct counsel and to refrain from eliciting evidence from the detainee until he has had that reasonable opportunity. 5)Individual and family photographs were not considered.  6)Statutes of fact, including those of the medical technician and the Crown witness, did not appear to be relevant. 7)Although the accused”s physical condition might have been a factor in issue, his statements and actions during the relevant time period did contribute to the issue of whether the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breathalyzer demand.  8)The officer”d received three phone calls from the defendant prior to making the demand. One of these calls was for gas. The other was for a doctor. The doctor testified that"

The Legal Profession Act, 1990 provides for an order for an inquiry into the conduct of members of the Law Society of Saskatchewan as they progress through criminal matters. The hearings were held intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time. HELD: The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing. The respondents have lost jurisdiction to take further proceedings against the applicant. 1)The applicant was a paid-up practising member of the law society. He was granted an inactive membership. He did not pay any inactive membership fee. 2)Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, it was incumbent upon the respondents to move without delay before the stay was granted and after it was lifted on the application of the respondents. This the respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests. 3)The respondent's failure to provide proper notice to the chairperson of the hearing committee and timely notice of sentencing on the matters referred to in the report of the Discipline Committee were grounds of disqualification."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases. The first proposed basis is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences but not the others. There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in a judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise. The second application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. It is the absence of a true nexus between the counts; the complexity of the evidence and the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; and the potential of the accused deciding to testify on one set of counts (i.e., those pertaining to April 8/14) could be more efficient and cost effective to have all the counts tried together and thereby be avoided while the accused is in custody. The Court has had the benefit of watching a two hour videotaped interview conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010. In that interview, the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or on April 14th. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The Crown has in the wings a ballistics report containing expert opinion evidence that match has been made between the gun used in the April 8th shooting and that found by the arresting police officers on April 13th. This finding can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests of justice require a joint trial."

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act, cancelling the existing Certificate of Title in the name of the respondent and appointing herself as tenants in common and directing the Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The sellers were not represented by legal counsel. They prepared a transfer of the property and sent it to the Land Tittles Office for registration. On August 20, 1997 a mortgage was registered by the lawyer on the title without the words 'as joint tenants' appearing on it. The error describing the purchasers on the mortgage went unnoticed by the owner. On the facts of this case there has been an obvious mistake which requires rectification. Damages in the circumstances are not a reasonably convenient remedy or procedure for giving relief. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The authorities had narrowly construed the discretion to amend or alter or cancel registrations under the Act. The courts when applying the provisions must be mindful of the integrity of the Torrens land Titles System. The authorities had a reasonable remedy available, which was to direct the registrar to cancel the existing title and issue new one in the names of the joint tenants. 2)The respondent intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. 3)The applicant had an alternate remedy that would correct the mistake but could provide compensation for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake.

There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. The child has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is the primary child that the child will continue to live in Regina or that she will have to travel more frequently to support the parenting time of each parent. The issue of custody and relocation to Victoria is to be determined by reference in Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 141 Sask. R. 241; 134 D.L.R. (4th) 321.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent and the parties' children were placed in the supervised care of T.B. who was given permission to return to Nova Scotia in 2006. Upon L.L.M.'s application, an ex parte order issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act prevented the children from leaving Cape Breton until further court hearing. The children's protection history was not disclosed to the Agency until six weeks after the children had moved to Alberta. The Agency determined that the information concerning B.R.W. was simply not germane to the decision made by the Agency. HELD: 1)The children's parents were aware of the extensive child protection history between the parties and that the Agency had actively supported the placement of the children in their care. However, the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the parents and to the court until after the disposition review commenced in November. 2)There was no evidence of physical or sexual abuse by the children. There was no credible evidence of threats to the children's safety or protection. The evidence was sufficient to justify the Agency's continued involvement. 3)The Agency was required to disclose all of the relevant information, which was not done by them personally. 4)The agency was also required to assume sole responsibility for K.B.'s care and the children would no longer be children in need of protective services.  5)It was necessary for the court to determine the proper disposition order in respect of the three children, namely, whether the agency failed to inform the parents of the nature of the child, the extent to which the children were exposed to substances, the level of protection provided by the parents, the amount of support the children received from the Agency, the time they had spent in foster care, and the appropriate amount of time and money to conduct the necessary disposition review.  6)The information contained in these documents had little impact on the decision making by the agency as the documents contained historical references only and related, not to the agency, but rather to its common law partner. It would appear that the agency was responding appropriately."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. 2) The accused's evidence was examined. It was evident that he had responded to an invitation from the police to attend at the police station. He had stated that he believed that the matter was closed and that he should return his call. She was required to specifically describe a number of incidents that took place over a period of about year and then year after the last of the incidents had taken place and believed her recollection was accurate. She believed that he intended to provide information to the police and that there was never any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. 3) There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21st, 2003 and the same cannot be said about the events in August 2003. The accused gave his version of events in the general office of the court in which he asked the complainant if she wanted to come to his condominium to use the swimming pool and he suggested that her son might be interested. She said that she did not know what to do. 4) The evidence clearly indicated that he pursued the complainant to make conversation - much of it sexual in nature. It is more than likely that he did not encourage the conversation and that she participated in it in the negative. 5) The Court held that the Crown should not use the statement to cross-examine the witness and that the Court must consider whether the Crown has proven the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt."

There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant applied for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application was opposed by the Attorney General of Canada.

The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed.  2) Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two children. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The evidence showed that the statements were made with express malice, which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. 3)The Court dismissed the application. It held that the facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in preventing a trial in which 'no party wins all parties lose', and the common interest of the people who make such communications. 4)The co-defendants brought an action to vary the custodial arrangements. The Court held that it would be in the best interests of the children if the trial was held in Unified Family Court."

The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The flight was delayed for about an hour and a half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff did not have a cause of action against the defendants but that the defendants acted in good faith by insisting on the use of a properly functioning air conditioning cart in the flight. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although the plaintiff would have been ousted if he had not plead guilty, his claim did not disclose a cause for action. HELD: 1)The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause. Firstly, all allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. There is a remedy for that damage provided for in the Warsaw Convention.  2)Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with respect to its predecessor, the Warsaw convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include the decision of Akehurst and Others v. Thomson Holidays Ltd., which involved a claim against commercial passenger airline (Britannia) and package tour operator (Thomson) arising from a crash landing. Although the Court would have dismissed the plaintiff's claim on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria outlined in the Act, for reasons that will be thoroughly canvassed in this judgment, it would also dismissed the certification Application on the other criteria as outlined in s6(a). 3)The generous approach to be adopted on this application is to set aside the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor which has no application to the facts of this case. The test is to apply to certification application as a class action.

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was dismissed. 2)The childcare costs were necessary and reasonable. The cost of the Childview program, with childcare costs of $7,800 per year, Sylvan learning centre costs of approximately $8,600 per year and the mother's contribution of $1,000 per month to the total cost of $2,872. 3)The preschool costs and the Learning Centre costs were both reasonable. If the father paid this amount, in addition to his s. child support amount, he would pay his proportionate share of the fees paid by the mother and Sylvan fees would be equal to 71% of the total costs.  4)The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400. 5)The mother's claim for retroactive child support was made pursuant to s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985. The father was not required to pay retroactive support. The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. 6)The cost of providing child support for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007 was reduced by $3,000. 7)There was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered by him. The Court was not prepared to make a retroactive order because the father was unable to pay at the interim stage. 8)Although the father has been voluntarily providing support to the Mother, at least since February 2007, the mother is required to have brought this motion in the pre-trial. She cannot, thus, make a decision regarding any extraordinary expenses for the special needs of the children.  9)The Court ordered that the father contribute in the amount of $4300 to the child support order pursuant to ss.7(1)(d) and s.8."
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided. HELD: 1) While there has been some debate about the appropriate manner of addressing the surplus, this is an appropriate case to grant interpleader relief under Rule 6-75 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by Ag Credit that it would terminate on the failure to pay the premium on the basis of disability and for a refund of unearned premiums in the event of a termination by the creditor. 2) While it may have been in the interests of some clients under the policy, there was no evidence that the insurer had colluded with any of the claimants. 3) The insurer had met its obligations as an insured client and was entitled to a portion of the surplus paid directly to it by its clients. 4) It did not collude with any claimants."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and ordered a new trial.  1) The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. He mischaracterized the complainant's testimony as being about bears and insects that could threaten the welfare of the complainant at night. 2) The court was unable to conclude that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault.  3) There was no miscarriage of justice resulting from the trial judge's error of law. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error alone."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries she claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall appeared to have been in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there but did know it could be found. 3)The plaintiff did not file separate affidavits as required by the simplified procedure. There were no records filed by the defendant prior to the trial. The logs indicated that floors were regularly cleaned at least once per hour during the period ending April 1. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief (which resulted in the offence leading to the charge). The Crown alleged the sentencing judge overemphasized the mitigating factors such as the mother's remorse, her abusive background, and her social and economic situation. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. The sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability ultimately failed. The court found as mitigating factors that the respondent had not done cocaine for at least two days and was suffering from withdrawal. She did not seek the support of her mother because she was not getting along with her. Finally, the court found that the absence of any support from her spouse and the fact that they were more concerned about their drug habits than they were about facing the challenges of looking after the children could not be considered a mitigating factors."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The surety was to be responsible for the sum of $1,000. The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture on the basis that the accused had not been made aware of what was expected of him and the possible consequences in the event of default; 2) the accused should have had an opportunity to read the document before signing it and the obligations being assumed and the potential consequences of default should have been explained to him or her. As the accused already had enough on his plate, he should have signed the document having full knowledge of his surety's obligations and liability. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in his eventual return to the province. It seems to me that the principle should also apply to the principal obligor, the accused, who was not given a copy of the document."

The application is accordingly dismissed. 2)The court was of the view that the learned youth court judge didn't err in declining to direct him to have counsel. Prior to the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal, the cases had predominantly held that the youth court had no jurisdiction to inquire into the means of the parents. 3)Counsel for the young person argued the judge relied on the Crown's contention that the matters he was facing were uncomplicated and fact-driven in deciding to not appoint counsel."

The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land in 1993 by the City Council passed a resolution to expropriate it for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The land was approximately 10 feet of the 30-foot rear yard for retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 with the work beginning in June 1994. In October 1994, the City council approved the abandonment of the land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. The solicitor for the Tannous rendered a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file. In March 1995, notice and statement of claim was filed by the claimant with the Utility and Review Board under the Expropriation Act. At the taxation hearing in August 1995, the taxing master reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The appellant alleged three errors by the Master. First, the statement of interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such interest and the Taxing Master was correct in declining any award of invoice interest. The second error was that the solicitors should have recognized the statutory offer was an initial offer and not necessarily or likely the final position of the City. The City should have taken an overall view and concluded that the services, although actually incurred, were not reasonable in all the circumstances. Further, the failure of the city to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the offer one of full compensation for interest. Finally, there was no evidence clearly establishing an entitlement to interest on default of payment being acknowledged and accepted."

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.

The fundamental questions were not raised in the affidavits but in the brief of law. It is unacceptable for legal counsel to present argument in the form of an affidavit but it does not follow that by doing so, the lawyer becomes obliged to open up his or her client files for review by third parties, nor examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross-examination."

The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office.

The landlord had signed a 3-year lease in good faith and was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. The tenant argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit, which violated the tenants' rights under s. 7(f) and s. 8(g) of the Act. The Hearing Officer also made an error in law in determining that the tenant was not entitled to possess the unit. Further, the Hearing officer made no errors in law.

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified.

The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was accepted. Due to extreme winter weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. The vapours would then be drawn to the pilot light in the furnace where ignition would occur and then flash back to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled. 2)The subsequent recall notice deleted any reference to off-road driving. 3)The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $50,000 as general damages, plus the $2,000 ordered in the amount of pre-judgment interest."

The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT. The wife sought to vary the child support provisions contained in a judgment for divorce granted September 17, 1997 to an amount that complied with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The parties had separated in 1995 and entered into an interspousal agreement in 1997. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the father had custody of the children and the mother had reasonable access on reasonable notice. The mother had recently commenced employment with the federal government and was on leave from her employment. HELD: 1)A variation of the existing order was warranted. The applicant had experienced a significant reduction in his income since 1997 and had been unable to obtain employment which compensated him at a level commensurate with that received while employed by the Federal government. The provisions of the Divorce Act require any variation order be made in accordance with the applicable Guidelines. Based on an annual income of $24,000 the applicant's child support obligation is $341 per month for the two children of the marriage. 2)No change in the circumstances of the respondent or the child disclosed in the material filed. 3)The application was dismissed with costs to the applicant."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis. The trial judge made the critical findings of fact which negate any attempt to overturn what is on its face a valid contract. The evidence supports probative evidence and the appellant's candid admissions at trial."
8_1995canlii4370.txt,"The respondent landowner haphazardly painted his buildings in order to protest a decision of Halifax city council. The city charged the respondent under the unsightly premises provisions of the Halifax City Charter. At trial, the court held the wording of the City Charter could not support the charge, and that a conviction would violate the respondent's s.2(b) Charter rights to freedom of expression. The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The respondent repainted the buildings in a haphazard and multi-coloured fashion. The buildings were an eye-sore. The Crown appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred in law in her application of s. 363 of the Halifax City Charter. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error in law. The meaning of 'unsightly' in subsection 363 when read as whole appears to be dealing with unsightliness in the context of dilapidation or neglect. 2)S. 363(3) must be interpreted in a manner prescribed by s. 9(5) of the Interpretation Act to insure the attainment of its objectives. 3)Any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s. 24 of the Charter."
d_2005nsca71.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The court disbelieved his evidence, principally because it was found to be internally inconsistent. The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on errors of fact and not on proper interpretation of evidence. There is no other way in which the appellant’s evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. 3) The trial judge erred in finding that the evidence substantial, material and essential to the conviction. 4) In the circumstances of this case, either use reveals a chain of reasoning not available to the judge in law or in logic on this record and the court concludes therefore that the appellant must show two things: 1) that the court misapplied the evidence on this point by failing to give proper effect to it; 2) that it was reasonable to expect the judge to infer guilt from the evidence based on an inference which the judge drew from it that is not supported by the record; and 3) that there was a material inconsistency in the appellant when he testified that he asked not to be left alone with the children because he was afraid of being charged with such an offence. The Court found that this inconsistency was substantial and material and played an essential part in his decision to convict."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff, an American citizen, commenced working for the defendant company in 1952 as an expatriate. He was assigned to various positions in the company from 1951 until 1986. He received a salary of $60,000. In 1986 he was reassigned to another position as a regional manager. He went on to work for several years as a senior level surveyor until 1983 when he became a full-time employee. The defendant offered him a position as project manager in 1988 but the position was changed to local status in 1985 when the plaintiff went to Argentina to establish an office. He claimed this was a formality which allowed him to terminate his employment without notice. He alleged this clause did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice. 2)30 days notice was not sufficient to abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given. 3)The defendant gave 30 days notice."

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay monthly spousals of $5,000 and $741 per month for the support of their two children. The interspousal contract provided that support would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner sought to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: 1)The agreement was not applicable to the petitioner. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. 3)The court observed that it is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support. In this case, the petitioner's income was not considered in relation to the respondent's gross income. 4)The respondent was ordered to pay $53,000 as child support. The $65,000 stubble tax credit was calculated from the date of the agreement to be used for the purposes of calculating the respondent’s gross income and taxable income. The amount payable was reduced in the amount of $40,000 by way of an adjustment to reflect the change in plans for the respondent. 5)It was not in the circumstances in which the court would make such an order. Equity requires the agreement be respected pending trial and the petitioner is entitled to costs.  6)The parties agreed that the interspoiral contract did not contemplate a variation of the spouseal support obligation in the event of a material change in circumstances. The trial judge would determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference in paragraphs 7.3 and 7.5 to adjustments which will consider the likely future earnings. Should there be a discrepancy between the actual income and anticipated income, the amount will be adjusted when the final amounts are known. 7)In this case the petitioner sought support pursuant to s.65 of the Miglin Act.  8)It is not appropriate in this case to make a retroactive order for this agreement and to have the agreement remain in place pending trial on the question of whether or not to impute income.  9)In the circumstances, this was not the appropriate case for the order.  10)There were no circumstances in the case which elevate it to one of those 'rare cases'."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code.

The accused was to complete one week of detoxification followed by a probation and parole period. 2)She had two prior convictions for drinking and driving. She had been through the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre in 2010 and 2006. After her first conviction, she was convicted of driving while over the legal limit. She remained sober for only a few months before resuming old habits. 3)Although it can never be said with certainty that the accused will not drink and drive again, her conduct over the last 18 months suggests that it is probable she will not.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant sought to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a daughter. The divorce settlement included terms of the parties' settlement of the property division issue, the terms of an agreement which incorporated aspects of the respondent's settlement with the applicant and the applicant. The applicant argued that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that the respondent had failed to take advantage of that debt. The respondent suggested that the applicant should have taken advantage of any vulnerability she had in the husband's treatment of her in the divorce proceedings. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when it was signed and there have been no material changes in the circumstances of either party since its signing. However, the agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. There was no pressure exerted upon the Applicant and no oppression during the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature as contemplated by Miglin (supra). 3)The agreement was designed to meet the needs of each party. The greater the vulnerabilities present at the time of formation, the more searching the court's review at this stage will indicate that the parties intended to do so voluntarily. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not unconscionable. She has not met that burden. 4)There has been no change in circumstances since the parties signed the Agreement. The Applicant was left essentially debt free while the husband was assuming debts of excess of $300,000. 5)The parties agreed to vary the monthly support of $5,500 to $4,535. 6)The respondent was to receive a lump sum to compensate her for the 'underpayment' of the applicant's rental income since the 1st of February 2003. It is not for this Court to substitute what it might have ordered had the legislation proceeded to trial. The court must be able to take into account a number of factors, including the respondent’s age, his health and retirement, and the reasonable expectation of retirement.  7)The court found that there had not been a material change in either parties’ circumstances since signing the Agreement (the parties had agreed to share in the costs of the divorce and the variation proceedings) and that there was no reason to discount the agreement."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime contrary to ss. 354(a) and 355(b)of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b). The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings on the basis that he had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. Dismissing the application for a stay, that the accused has not established that there have been breaches of this right within reasonable time, and that society's interest will not parallel that of the accused. HELD: The accused's charges are absolute jurisdiction offences as per s. 553 of the Code.  1) The Court found that society as a whole has an interest in seeing that the least fortunate of its citizens who are accused of crimes are treated humanely and fairly. In this respect trials held promptly enjoy the confidence of the public. 2) There is a societal interest that is by its very nature adverse to the interests of an accused. The accused has no interest in an early trial and society will not be able to explain away delay that is otherwise unreasonable. 3) In some cases, the accused's s. 11(c) is not imposed on him by reason of lack of evidence, lack of supervision, or lack of proper counsel. In other cases, it is necessary for society to have a say in the process of proceedings. 4) In the case of the Charter application, the Court concluded that society has an intrinsic value to the accused that it cannot be relied upon by the Crown to explain a delay that would otherwise be unreasonable. 5) In this sense the accused is not establishing that there has been an unreasonable delay in the conduct of his criminal proceedings. As a result of this evidence the Court has dismissed the application, which is a violation of his Charter rights.  6) The length of delay is a threshold issue and the question is whether the overall length of time between arrest and trial is prima facie sufficient to trigger Charter scrutiny. The Court also concluded that the following factors contribute to the delay: 1) It is unreasonable to expect the accused to complete his portion of a Form R-1 before the hearing begins; 2) The inherent time requirements of"
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed.

His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was challenged on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend. 2)The accused had previously informed his lawyer of the court date. 3)The s7(3) of the Criminal Code provides that all common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the Contract between the defendant and the city of Regina.  1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. 2)The single issue of privity was overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached.  3)The case will not turn on the question of privities. While, strictly speaking, the plaintiffs weren't actual parties, they were not parties, the broad thrust of everything that was argued was that some benefits intended to be passed through a general contract passed through the members' general contract. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. 4)Once the plaintiffs have constructed their case, they will not have to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and the mayor, as well as the city, to decide the case as presented; that the plaintiffs are entitled to $12,000 in damages for breach and costs of this action and $17,000 for this action."

Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed.

The first plaintiff brought an interlocutory application seeking production of documents by the defendants. The second plaintiff sought an order for documents by requesting an order in respect to the plaintiffs documents and an order that the plaintiffs provide further and betterparticulars.

When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart.

The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the Union of Food and Commercial Workers which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving WalMart. The Union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion the Union applied to strike and remove three newspaper articles and an article from the Regina Leader-Post and two newspaper articles. The statements of claim in these articles were critical and disparaging of the applicant. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. WalMart's application was dismissed. HELD: 1) There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent such an explanation why he is not available to testify at the hearings he is no longer required to testify. 2) The affidavits of the union members and the transcript of the radio broadcast are admissible. They are attached to an affidavit of one Ryan Kraikas who attests that he prepared the transcript. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript."" 3) The relief sought by the union should be granted and the application brought by Wal-mart Canada Corp. should be dismissed. The applicant has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such an evidence it is impossible to conclude there is a reasonable apprehension of bias within the Saskatchewan labour Relations Board or that there is justification for such a finding. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. 4) The affidavit of the WalMart employee who swore an affidavit does not apply. It is not admissible to prove anything about the content of the comments made by the members of the Board. The admissible portions of the affidavits and the articles were found to be inadmissible. It does not disclose anything about their contents or their contents. The contents of the newspapers and articles which were disparaging to the applicant are only admissible if there is some degree of interference with the Board's functioning and, in the same vein, it offers nothing about whether the information they contain is true, accurate or reliable. 5) The extracts from newspapers were admissible but not"
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. He began residing in foster care with a significant support system. As he has grown up, the respondent has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. He is currently under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. His blood alcohol level is 110 mgs. per cent. He remained in custody until the fitness hearing on November 1, 2007.  3) In asking the court to require that the accused be able to act in his own best interests, this court asks that the court adopt the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining the accused's fitness to stand a trial. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined in this case is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that although the appellant can communicate with his lawyer and assist counsel in his/her defence, the accused must be capable of recounting the facts of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or, indeed, the need for a person to appreciate his own own best interest. 4) It is immaterial at this stage that his guilty plea would result in an increased number of cases in which the accused is incapable of making rational decisions beneficial to himself. It is unconscionable that he would be unable to instruct counsel in a manner that would be in his best interests and that, in fact, he would resist the assistance altogether."
2002skqb125.txt,"FIAT. The issue was whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs because the two motions served by the plaintiffs were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by the Queen's Bench Rules;  the motion filed at the Court House was not served on the defendants; plaintiff's counsel advised the defendants that the two motions which had been served on them were not in fact going to proceed. HELD: Given the lawyer's representation as to the amount of stress he was under, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly or at this time. The matter was left to the trial judge.","FIAT. On January 24, 2002, the matter was heard in chambers and the issue was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. The plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another. In his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. HELD: 1)The matter had been heard in January 2002 and was reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs. 2)Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs. 3)Given Tapp's representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time. Accordingly, the Court left the matter to the trial court in its course of this action."
2005skqb257.txt,FIAT: The defence has indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. Defence now wants further disclosure of information that relate to those important issues. HELD: Further disclosure is ordered. The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.,"FIAT: The Crown asks further disclosure of information for the purpose of preparing for and pursuing an inquiry into the facts that relate to these important issues. The defence wants further disclosure. HELD: The essence of the authorities is that on motions of this kind the Court ought to guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions'—speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, however, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. The Crown shall make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops of out-of-province vehicles made by Constable Chornecki in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; (f) On what other grounds the searches had been conducted using the 'consent' form used by the constable; (g) On whether the searches resulted in the discovery of narcotics; and (h) On if the warrants had been obtained in the search for the contraband. The parties will note that the Crown has not ordered the names of the drivers stopped be disclosed and that have not ordered their actual notes to be reproduced. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. The appellant argued that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in his charge. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.  1) The trial judge was of the opinion that counsel for the defence had done most adequately and that it was neither necessary nor desirable that he should repeat the outline of those discrepancies. The evidence of the Crown was that the appellant's cross-examination of the complainant would not have served any useful purpose and might well have so confused the jury as to detract from their efficient discharge of their sworn duty. 2) The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The charge was found to be consistent with R. v. Jacquard.  3) The appellant's point of view was that if the sentence of two years or more was imposed, the appellant would have had no appeal against the order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of 2 years less a day was imposed he would be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown requested an order be made under s. 718.2 of the Code prohibiting the accused from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the ages of 14 and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. The accused's mother had been a big part of his rehabilitation and he had received fines, driving prohibitions and, in one case, probation. She also testified that he sexually touched her private parts during his youth. HELD: This was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community was available or appropriate. The maximum sentence requested by the Crown was 10 years imprisonment followed by a 1 year term of probation with a minium punishment of imprisonment for term of 40 days.  1) This is a case that a sentencing court must take into consideration relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender in considering whether or not a sentence should be increased or reduced. The Court ordered that the accused serve a 10 year sentence in a community subject to conditions that the court imposes. 2) The accused was ordered to provide sufficient samples of his bodily substances so that a DNA analysis could be conducted. 3) He was to comply with a sex offender registry order (unopposed by the defence) and the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (S.O.R. 2004). 4) The Court granted the accused one year probation and ordered him to participate in assessments, education and/or treatment in an approved program or programs for substance abuse and sex offenders as may be directed by and to the satisfaction of S.C.’s probation officer. 5) There was no evidence of any compulsive or compulsive acts or any of the other aggravating factors that the Court considered relevant."
8_2006skca58.txt,"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement. They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that the parties are absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest.

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue is whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2). HELD: 1) The application is dismissed with costs.  2) There are four purposes of the affidavit filed pursuant to the Act. The first purpose is to establish whether the indebtedness claimed to be owing fits within the limits of the foundation. 3) The affidavit materializes with the required precision the amount of the debt owing by the defendant. 4) The affidavits filed by the applicant are not considered by the Court. The Court has not considered any of the contents of the statement of claim or statement of defence and counterclaim. The reason for that is important. Although there is reference in the Statement of Claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0% per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement of September 10, 2001. 5) The four pages of a four page invoice attached to the affidavit as Exhibit C are true copies of the operating agreement and a copy of the four page salesale. 6) The plaintiff's claim discloses a prima facie claim for debt or liquidated damage pursuant to ss. 3.1(1)(b) and 7) as outlined by Bayda in Conexus, supra. 7) The Court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues."

She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a variation of the Corollary Relief Judgment in which he alleged that the mother had refused to provide access and communication with his four children. The father had been denied access with his children for multiple sclerosis and was now facing the prospect of losing his mobility. He requested that all restrictions on his access with the children be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to driving. The mother opposed the application and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the evidence showed that the father's medical condition and his use of marijuana did not contribute to the breakdown of the marriage. As long-term treatment, marijuana helps alleviate his symptoms, his ability to drive, and his disability pension. However, the evidence did not show that his children would be able to use marijuana at night when they were not required to drive."

This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and rheumatology in the United States. HELD: 1) The respondent will have few lean years until he has paid off the arrear. He wants to develop a private practice. He did not have the ability to pay child support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. 2) The petitioner has always been a child of the marriage. She is 63 and still caring for one of their children who will likely never be independent because he suffers from serious mental illness. The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support pursuant to the 1998 and 2001 orders. The 2001 order was varied and therefore his child support obligations are still calculated on an income of $109,912. 3) There is no hardship to either party. The only issue to be considered is the onus on the respondent to establish on a balance of probabilities that he cannot now pay, and will not in the future be able to pay, the child support he owes. The onus is on him to establish that he can now pay and will, in some form or fashion, the obligation he owes his children. He has failed to do so. The court found that the respondent has not shown that he has a financial capacity to pay the children. It is common for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The starting point is that in the absence of some special circumstance, arrearns should only be expunged where the payee has established on a high probability that he or she cannot pay, is an undue hardship. 4) The Court found that even if the respondent had to work longer than he should, he still had the means to pay them. 5) The amount of child support owed by the petitioner is $183,746. The Court calculated that the imputed income of the respondent in relation to his income was $106,000. The fact that he failed to pay this amount, combined with the fact that the petitioner's child support obligation under the 2001 order had not been varied, resulted in an increase in the arreaars by $20,000 to $31,000 in the amount of $2,745 for the children's care in the period between July 1, 2001 until April 30, 2013. The arreARS have increased over"
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant contended that his evidence was totally irrelevant to the charges and worse, that the evidence given by the Crown was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant's credibility. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence raised issues of admissibility of evidence, appropriateness of questions asked of the appellant in cross-examination and the impact these matters may have on the integrity and fairness of the trial; the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and was there sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements. 2)The trial judge did not enter into a voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay and you can ask him questions.”  3)Section 264.1 of the Code provides that an offence who, in any manner, knowingly utters, conveys or causes any person to receive a threat (a to cause death or bodily harm to any person; (b) to burn, destroy or damage real or personal property; or (c) to kill, poison or injure an animal or bird that is the property of any person is an offence of this nature. The only reasonable inference that one can draw from the evidence is that the appellant intended to get reaction from the reader of the e-mail. It was not his status as a student that we were concerned about."

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement. After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused, and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one of the victims to the witness box. Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to call this witness. The Crown counsel argued that the defence had not disclosed their intention to use the witness and that the witness was a client of Bendig's Law Office. HELD: 1)A stay of proceedings was out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by not being told that Ace Carlos Whitecap would be a Crown witness. 2)The Crown's failure to disclose its intention not to call the witness seriously damaged the accused's representation with respect to the cross-examination of the witness. 3)The only remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call that witness. A stay was in order as the accused had not been permitted to give evidence in this trial and any subsequent trial would be in breach. A lawyer should have sat through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross examination of this witness and he might have had to take over the case entirely to be sure to protect the interests of both Whitecap and Lathlin. 4)Leave was not in order. The court must take into account all aspects of the failure to make full disclosure. The nature of the charge, delay, adjournments to date and at who's request, the nature of evidence not disclosed and the Crown's explanation for the omission will impact on the relief. 5)The court must also take into consideration all of the factors considered in fashioning an appropriate remedy. The Supreme Court held that entering a stay in proceedings is last resort to be taken only when all other acceptable avenues of protecting the accused are exhausted. The Court must also consider the extent to which the impunged non-disclosure has prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the accused. 6)The Court must determine whether the accused has met the test set out in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada and whether the defence has met this test."

The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. There was no new, controversial or unusual issue of practice raised by the appeal. The issues were determined to be better left for resolution by the Court of Queen’s Bench after hearing vive voce evidence at trial.","The applicant sought to appeal from a chambers judge's decision not to vacate a certificate of pending litigation registered on behalf of her estranged husband against title to certain lands. His estate was represented by his executors. The applicant had filed a notice of appeal under s.47 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, but did not consider whether the order appealed from was interlocutory or final in nature. She subsequently filed notice of motion seeking either leave to appeal or directions from chambers judge that leave was not required. Accordingly, as a preliminary matter, the applicant was put to decide whether the chambers judge abused his discretion. She then filed a leave of appeal and, with no objection from the respondent, her application proceeded. HELD: The application for leave was dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise a particular in its implications. Given the nature of the impugned order, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudiced the prospective outcome.  2)At its heart, the proposed appeal could be interpreted as setting out two grounds of appeal that appear to allege the Chambers judge either committed an error in principle or disregarded material facts when he decided to not vacate the Certificates pending litigation against the lands in question. However, at its core, the proposal would involve revisiting an interlocutorutory order that preserves the status quo pending final decision after trial. 3)The applicant did not raise the prospect of a fair and impartial outcome. The proposed appeal did not raised a new and controversial issue of law, nor did it raise new or uncertain or unsettled points of law. However it did raise a question of law which might be of interest to the applicant.

The Court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. There are too many variables and probabilities. The fall into the window, the fall into dresser and the fall to the floor were all in the accused's favour. The assault in the bedroom was one continuing episodic event.

e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to ss. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to 24 months custody followed by a period of probation with credit for 6 months of pre-sentence detention and a 6 month community supervision. The defence requested an approximate credit of for 1 on the charge of aggravated assault causing serious bodily harm and that the accused would be permanently disabled by the time he was sentenced. HELD: A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A credit of 1.5 for each day spent in detention was granted for the period of 18 months, 12 months of which would be served in closed custody, and 6 months community supervision was granted. 1)The aggravating factors were the egregious nature of the assault, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the victim. 2)Mitigating is the early guilty plea, thereby saving the complainant the additional anguish of having to testify at a trial. The young person did not oppose the Crown's application and had done reasonably well. The impact on the victim and his family was life-altering."

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the previous grounds of appeal. 1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. The assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) Each of the issues raised in this case was dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. Exactly the same reasoning applies here. 3) The court was able to divide the issue of abnormal functional obsolescence into two categories: 1) by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions in the Assessment Manual or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used; and 2) by creating a commercial building 'like a grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire City of Saskatoon.' It was not the ground for the decision but rather a result of the appellant's failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case."

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review theessment. At the hearing, the Director filed another letter, reducing the assessorship to reflect the existence of a public holiday. At issue was whether the City was required to pay the employee overtime for hours worked over 32 in a week which had a holiday in it and if so, if so what rate. HELD: The City's application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due orowing to the transit employee. There would be no order as to costs. 1)The legislature intended the rate of pay provision in any agreement to be read and evaluated in the light of the other provisions of the agreement before comparison was made with its counterpart in the Act. The legislature contemplated that it should be left open to demonstrate that a provision (in an agreement) on its face less favourable than its counterpart is more favourable than the latter is evident not only from the wording of the section but from the decision itself to include the second branch of S62(1) in the section. 2)There was no difficulty therefore in concluding that in light of today's decision the provisions of this agreement should govern, and not those of the Act, and that the provisions were more favourable to Morgan than those in the act."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the warrant: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the residence of each accused issued in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside, and as information obtained from the Electronic Surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set Aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. The granting of leave to cross-examine is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence on the Charter hearing. It would appear that given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code there is no reason that the granting of a leave to examine should be the preserve of the trial judge. There is a strong directive to that end and s. 540(1)(a) is strong. This should not be considered a usurpation of a trial judge’s function. Where leave is granted at the preliminary inquiry stage to conduct cross-examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization to obtain evidence in respect of offences contrary to s(trafficking, possession for the purpose of trafficking), (cultivation), (proceeds of crime) and 19.2 (laundering proceeds) of the Narcotic Control Act and 'any conspiracy, or attempt to commit, or being an accessory after the fact, or counselling, procuring or inciting in relation to such offences, the discretion of the judge should not been interfered with on appeal except in cases in which it has not been judicially exercised."

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under The Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. The constitutional question is not properly before me. 2)The three bylaws tendered were not to be amended. The zoning bylaw referred to an operation relating to keeping livestock. The amendments to the bylaw addressing the meaning of the word 'hamlet' did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue. 3)The uncertainty on the part of the appellant's relying in attacking the bylaws did not exist. The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs did not refer to any amendments. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments; 4)The evidence had come into the possession and that it could have been admitted on appeal if, by due diligence, it could not have been adduced at trial, as R. v. Palmer (1979), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 and Carriere (2004 SKCA 80) were found to be relevant. 5)The trial justice made no error in law. His findings of fact were supported by the evidence."

This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother. Determining that the courts in both Nunavut and Nova Scotia have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of custody, that it was in the best interests of the child to remain in Nova Scotia and for the custody hearing to be held in Nova Scotia.","This was an application for custody of the child. The mother had previously resided with her father in Nova Scotia and the father had moved away from Nunavut before he knew the mother was pregnant. Due to the unavailability of translation services and obtaining a transcript, the mother had to spend considerable time with her mother to retain ties with her Inuit culture. The father had not returned the child for several years and had made an application to extend the original agreement beyond the agreed year. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had access to the mother's residence and a translated transcript had been received. Although this status quo was consideration it was only one of a number of factors to be considered in arriving at what is in the best interest of the young child.  1)The father was to provide the financial and environmental factors; 2)The mother's physical environment did not compare to that of the applicant. She did not have a permanent residence (a concern of her mothers) nor did she have a steady income (means of support). 3)The court was cognizant of the fact that the applicant was an Inuit mother and her wishes for the child to go to live with her and her father were granted. 4)The applicant had reason to send the son to Nova Scotia, in addition to wanting him to know his father. The wishes of the mother were to be granted."

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. They alleged that RBC covered the stock issues of the two companies despite their possession being not communicated to the plaintiffs. RBC denied any wrongdoing by its solicitor and said the matter was allowed to proceed to trial. The plaintiffs applied to dismiss the proceeding on the basis of three factors: 1) an inordinate delay; 2) an inexcusable delay; 3) the delay was entirely due to the negligence of RBC's solicitor and the plaintiff himself was blameless; and 4) the plaintiffs acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. Relief was granted. The Bankrupt had 13 years of student loans outstanding. The proposal was made because she was advised by a debt counsellor that it would be an effective way of satisfying her student loans.

She applied for the order that Paragraph 178 (1)(g) does not apply to her outstanding student loan applications.

It was understandable in the early years when she did not have permanent employment she was unable to service the loans. It is understandable that in the later years she did have a reasonable income, which was near the poverty line. To expect them to pay in a shorter period would be too long.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto.

The issue is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. HELD: 1) The accused is entitled to hard copies of any documents used by the Crown at trial. The Crown has stated that it is an obligation for disclosure in general terms in a slightly different fashion. The question is not providing simply usable format for the defence but that the disclosure should be provided in a manner that is reasonably accessible by the defence. There is no need for the Crown to provide hard copy of any document created on paper and scanned into the computer unless the document 'has been, or will be, utilized by the police or the Crown in hard copy' (R. v. Laporte). In this case, the nature and format of disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been providing in a reasonably accessible manner that does not detract from the accused's right to make full answers and defence.  2) There is the evidence in support of the search warrants in this case is easily found in the database, and cross-referencing to the police officers' notes in supporting that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed in the affidavit. This information is often crucial to the defence through the electronic disclosure. 3) It is appropriate that the issue of full disclosure provided in useables be adjourned to allow Crown counsel an opportunity to review some of the source documents in relation to the search warrant. The utilization of hard copies for trial preparation that is sought by the Defence, this appears to be a reasonable resolution. In all other respects, it is appropriate to provide some basic information regarding the nature of the disclosure provided so far.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have him declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer with a weapon. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by Criminal Code s.752. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years and the Court must consider the totality of the record, the evidence presented in support of the application, whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be found to be dangerous or long-term offender."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor for the police to take any statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. This additional informational requirement on police ensures that detainee who persists in wanting to waive the right to counsel will know what it is that he is actually giving up. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper but the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s s. 8 Charter rights by failing to explicitly warn the police of the obligation to provide unequivocal advice to the accused once he has changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. 2) The respondent had not provided unequivocal warning to the police as to the extent that it would have affected his ability to obtain legal advice and assistance in the circumstances, nor has there been an unequivocal waiver by the respondent of his right to seek legal advice. The Crown has not raised this issue with respect to the learned judge. 3) The lack of Prosper warning does not mean the respondent had to explicitly advise the police that he had a right to immediate free legal advice, but rather that the police were required to advise the detainee of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction. 4) On the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed, and no such obligation exists, a waiver of this right may be required by the Crown to be granted. However, such a waiver must be free and voluntary and it must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. 5) The failure of the Crown in this case to disclose the extent to which the respondent has waived his or her right to consult with a lawyer on a free and open basis is a serious breach of that right and the Court concludes that it has rendered unequivocal, unequivocal and unequivocal"

The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. Although the accused had apologized to the complainant and apologized to his mother, there was nothing from any of the witnesses who testified that undermines credibility. The complainant had initiated the physical aggression by hitting the accused on the shoulder in frustration at how matters had unfolded. None of that scenario supported the Crown being able to prove that the complainant had not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred. The accused must receive the benefit of the doubt in that regard."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and was always in possession of the car. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The Court held that ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of a registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that were not addressed that: 1) the petitioner had not proven that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and 2) that addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it not in the best interests of the children and that their father had only supervised access to them. It concluded that the risk of harm was high and that the petitioner was not entitled to give evidence that she had rebutted the presumption that she was protecting the children from their risk of sexual abuse by the respondent father; and 3) that there was no evidence that increased contact would be beneficial to the children as a result of the respondent's increasingly extreme anger management issues.

The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain.

Since then, the petitioner has reduced the amount of support to 1,500 per month and even those that have been irregular and not on time have been paid on time. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asked for was fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty as to the petitioner's future job and income. 2)There was no evidence as to what she would require if she did go to a university this fall. The father was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the monthly maintenance he consistently paid. 3)The petitioner had not been consulting with the petitioner as to her future employment and income at the time of the application.  4)Since the application was an interim application it would be premature to apply the amount proposed. The guidelines suggest that the applicant should have received at least $2,400 per month in support of their two children. 5)The applicant was to have her costs recovered on the basis of consulting with her doctor. 6)Spousal support was to be paid in full to the mother on the 31st of June."

The intent being that once that occurs, the separate action for damages commenced by Medusa will be consolidated into one action with the respondent as defendant and plaintiff by counterclaim. Bough vigorously opposes the motion to convert as it is not satisfied that the initial application can be heard in months rather than years.

Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. This was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration. The application to the Board, by the appellant C.U.P.E., to determine whether it represented a majority of the employees, was made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable.

It does not, as noted, apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. This is its function. To emphasize facts of lesser traditional legal significance in the Board's judgment and those of more concrete significance in a parallel area begs the real question.

7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the claim of the plaintiffs. In February 2012, counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial. At that time, Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, advised the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. That was later confirmed when a certificate of dissolution was filed with the Court. HELD: 1) The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process. The Court ordered that Orion Morgan should be produced for the purpose of cross- examination.  2) The Court was aware that there is case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. It was not prepared to follow those decisions but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation the Court made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. 3) The court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs that the Court accept Ms. Fehr's affidavit.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1999. It was owned by the defendants, who had previously sold the property to the plaintiff. The plaintiff later sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She claims aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. The defendants claim that they were patent and that caveat emptor applies. HELD: 1) The inspection of the property by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park was not conducted in accordance with the requirements set out in the building permit. The rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences.  2) The search for suitable home then expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. The realtor was a woman who had recently purchased a country home. She claimed aggravated damages, including damages based upon mental and emotional distress, against the defendants and against the plaintiff's husband and wife for failure to inform her that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. There was no discussion about home inspection or home inspection.  3) The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $250,000.00, aggravated damages in the amount of $350,000, and general damages against the individuals and organizations who had provided the necessary financial support to purchase the home.  4) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.

The plaintiff had been dismissed from his position as president and chief executive officer of the corporation. STC awarded damages in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as might have occurred in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that under the Crown employment contracts act, the Crown had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts including those of Crown corporations and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law.

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home.

The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and observations were not sufficiently strong or probative to confirm the existence of the marihuana grow operation and to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information.

The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether any injuries sustained were not minor injuries. The plaintiff also argued that it would be unfair to strike the defendant from behind on the facts because he was travelling too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. The appeal against the order for summary judgment was allowed and the application before Judge Burke was set aside. It was not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The court was satisfied that there had to be an 'air of reality' to the defence. It would be risky to assess any amount at this point in time as there was a lack of medical opinion in the discovery of experts. The case law may be summarized as follows: 1)A summary judgment application under Rule 13.01(A) is not to be a trial or mini trial where an estimate of the plaintiff’s ultimate recovery can be difficult and may amount to nothing more than a haazard guess. In such cases the Court should refrain from making an order of interim payment. 2)The standard pleading that the plaintiff stopped abruptly without more by way of supporting facts, lacks an air of reality. It does not meet, nor suggest how the defendant hoped to meet, the plaintiffs assertion that she had been stopped for 45 seconds. It is necessary for the defendant in his pleadings or via affidavit or other evidence to assert facts capable, if proven at trial, of rebutting the presumption that the collision resulted from his negligence. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application for summary judgement. 3)Costs in the cause of the action were set aside on the grounds that the application could be brought at any time."
e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was acquitted on both counts. At trial, Crown counsel consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture pursuant s. 20(4). Brooks had deposed that she was innocent of any complicity in the offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied the property was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property, particularly the provisions relating to the sale of stolen property, respectively, did not permit Brooks to be found guilty of either charge. 2) The Court must be cognizant of the standard of review available to an offender, particularly in view of the fact that the offender is a person who was charged with a designated substance offence. The principles of s. 11 and s. 12 of the Charter were not to be applied to deprive a person of a piece of property which is a 'offence-related property' but rather to provide relief to an otherwise innocent person who might be deemed to have been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father applied for child support pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring him to pay maintenance for his son. The mother had moved in with the father prior to the father obtaining a consent order which allowed him to be in his father's custody for the time being. At the time of the accident, the father was working full-time jobs and living with the mother. He abandoned his upgrading attempt and sought employment. He returned to live with his mother in late June when his father told him to move out. The father applied to terminate the support on the basis that the support was unrealistic in light of his limitations arising from the brain injury. Application dismissed; the evidence did not show any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under the Charter and that the respondent be paid all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. Allowing the application, setting aside the control test and ordering the respondent to pay the applicants all compensation for the time they had spent filing the grievance, that the order infringed the applicant's rights as employees and that all of the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act applied retroactively to the applicant."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. Sadly, the petitioner, Megan Wolfe, died of cancer in January 2015. The father takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of the Children’�s Law Act, 1997 and it is equally applicable when a family member pursues custody. Not only does the grandmother have a blood tie to the children, but the children have lived with her for the past seven years. 2) It is clear there were concerns regarding the father’ s. 3 use of alcohol and drugs. However, the grandmother testified that she was aware the mother had moved to the area and that her home was the primary residence for the children. She was willing to provide the father with parenting time. 3) There was no evidence that the grandmother was a person with sufficient interest in the matter. The evidence from the three parties was that the father was not seeing the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. There was evidence that he was only intermittently accessing the children during the day. 4) The grandmother was at the hearing on the application for contempt for failing to obtain an order for substitutional service on the grandmother. 5) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest question” is the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child. The nature of their relationship and the question of the best interests does not enter the analysis at that point. In determining whether non-family applicant is person with a sufficient interest, the court should consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant’d involvement in the child, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and quality of his involvement, how the relationship was represented to the world, whether the grandmother provided financially for the child and whether the father could be assisted by CLASSIC to represent himself.  6) There were no established circumstances in which the grandmother might be a person without sufficient interest status."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the plaintiff for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the time September 24/October 23/98.  1)SGI's benefits were terminated under s.180(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.  2)The plaintiff was found to have suffered serious injuries to his cervical spine, neck and back and the plaintiff was unable to perform farm duties due to his injuries. 3)The court was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to fail, without a valid reason to attend his scheduled assessment in Wascana."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he did not own a computer at the time he engaged in the activity, but had enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in 2005 in Latin course. He used a computer in capacity, that involves being in position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of fourteen years, and had a computer system within the meaning of s. 342.1 for the purpose of communicating with people under the ages of 14 years. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years as well as the additional orders made under s. 487.051 of the Code. 1)The defendant did not have a criminal record. He was active on a website dedicated to man-girl relationships. The website he was accessing had a section called 'ask cop'. The probation officer noted the Primary Risk Assessment to reoffend placed the defendant in the medium risk category, which category recidivates at approximately 50 percent over 3 years. 2)There was no evidence to support the conditional sentence as it would not be strong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage in the act of distributing child porn. 3)The sentence was met by a period of incarceration. Terms of the probation order were as follows: Keep the peace, be of good behaviour, report to supervisor within two working days from the date of release from jail and thereafter continue to report as directed by the supervisor. Use 'FIRST LAY' or 'SUBTEEN GIRL' as model stories. Use one-to-one sessions with a therapist or psychiatrist. 4)Leave the internet completely unsupervised for 12 months barring the posting of any written works. 5)Leave a computer or any form of electronic non-textual communication with anyone under the 18 years of age group. 6)Leave any place that is less than an hour from where you were arrested and remain in Saskatchewan unless written permission is granted. 7)House arrest for an isolated individual such as the defendantwould not be much different from the life he presently leads, and would notrepresent sufficient denunciation. A conditional sentence would be a fit sentence."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. In the interim, the court issued a supplementary Interim Ruling, which requested that the defendant return all of the claims for issue pursuant to s. 7(1) of The Small Claims Act. The judge had refused, in his written opinion, to issue the summons for the first time on the issue of whether or not the claims should be issued. The applicant had argued that the summons should not be issued because the defendant had failed to provide a clear understanding of what was contemplated in the terms of the agreement. In addition, the defendant alleged that the Saskatchewan government had breached its fiduciary obligation and incidental duties to preserve the rights and privileges of the plaintiff and to not engage in illegal, unlawful, coercive legislative policy or obstructive acts. The court declined to issue a summons as requested. The issues raised by these claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in the court's view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement was made."

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of maintenance. Section of land owned by the petitioner was valued at $293,874. The difference in value relates to a section of land which the respondent brought into the marriage. The share of the 1998 crop had value of $16,000. The petitioner had three sources of income, namely: CPP Disability Pension, Disability Insurance, and Pension for the children. In addition, the respondent was to receive $508 by way of Canada Pension Plan Benefits. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a monthly payment of $442. The Court noted that the respondent does not need financial assistance. It was suggested that because he doesn't manage his finances well he could live in a group home and the related income exceeds $150,000 but the amount of $2,292.58 is the result of an arbitrary and artificial attribution. On the basis of the respondent's income the children are being adequately provided for. The court noted that in addition to the $5,000 in maintenance the respondent should receive $10,000 from the CPP pension and the balance of $6,000 should be paid to the petitioner by monthly payments of $500 and $1,000 for legal fees. In the alternative the petitioner should receive half of the $10 million in spousals from the respondent and the $1 million in mortgage and land tax payments. In any event the petitioner has the means to pay $500 per month. In accordance with the Guidelines the respondent is entitled to a portion of his income from the sale of an off-setting asset which could be sold and reduced loan payments would result."

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to her daughter from an earlier relationship. That child is the 11 year old of that child.

The separation that has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of the child. The petitioner demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest with respect to this child. This involves an assessment of the nature of the relationship between the petitioner and her half-sister. The presumption that it is in the children's best interests that she have access to him is more consequence to the legal position that the petitioner may be considered a person who has demonstrated a settled intention to treat the child as his own.

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the incident was captured on two security videos, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused had inflicted injuries to nine inmates in the course of the assault on the victim. The Crown had established that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s. 34(2) of the Code."
c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)There was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused's evidence of the accused. The officer testified that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece of his vehicle. He said he waited for the ready light to come on. He got an imbalance signal from the machine. He stopped the test and blew three times in all. 3)The accused did not provide adequate instructions to the officer as to what to do with the sample or how to provide the sample. There was no adequate instruction on how to do this on a breathalyser or in any other form of testing. It was an attempt to explain to himself why things did not work on the night in question. There were three or four phone calls during that short trip. The last call came when they were at the pines just north of Prince Albert. After that the officer slowed down. He did not inform the accused of anything. He wrote on the Promise to Appeal served on him: “I did not refuse breathalyzer”. Although the accused had not told the young officer of why he thought he may have been having difficulty blowing sufficient sample for the officer, he did tell the court he is asthmatic. His asthma is worse when exposed to animal hair. The evening before he helped his son skin a deer that his son had just shot. He had to use his prescribed inhaler then and again at the party where he had had his two or three beers. The following day he was in the detachment and blew his breath into the machine while he was driving. He blew three more times during the blowing and then blew three other times while he did so. He gave no explanation for the difficulty in blowing the sample except that it was difficult for him to understand why things were not working and he did not understand how he could get adequate instructions for getting the sample from the Province to"
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The time periods for each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact."
